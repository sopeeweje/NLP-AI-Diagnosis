"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9838368,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,687155,0.060861971994445395
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9798875,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,357486,0.07884029072108228
"Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches Summary: There is an urgent need for an automated decision support system for diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). TBI is one of the leading causes of death in the modern world, and substantially contributes to disability and impairment. The early detection of TBI and its proper management presents an unfilled need. We therefore aim to supplement clinicians' decisions by developing a decision support system for monitoring and integrating available information of a TBI patient for accurate and quantitative diagnosis and prognosis. This project is the main component of a long-term goal of building a system that creates personalized treatment plans. Specifically, we intend to automatically detect and accurately quantify two critical abnormalities including shift in the brain's middle structure (Aim 1) and intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 2) from computed tomography (CT) head scans. In Aim 1, we develop a model for delineating the spatial shift in brain structure and its predictive power. We employ anatomical landmarks to detect a 3D deformed surface of the brain midline after TBI. Such an approach allows us to quantify the shifted volume, a measurement that is not currently achievable. Additionally, it provides accurate and timely access to conventional midline shift in a 2D CT slice. In Aim 2, we build a model for delineating intracranial hemorrhage and its predictive power. We implement a 3D convolutional neural network model to detect hemorrhagic regions and quantify and localize their volume. Currently, these measurements are inaccurate and not readily available due to the cumbersome manual process; instead a lesion's thickness in a 2D CT slice is used to assess its severity. In both Aim 1 and 2, we automatically calculate conventional and proposed volumetric and locational measurements and compare them to suggest the best diagnostic metric for each abnormality. Finally, in Aim 3, we build an automated pipeline for TBI severity assessment and outcome prediction. To this end, manual CT scan reads will be integrated with patient-level information available from electronic health records to achieve accurate data-driven diagnosis and prognosis. We implement machine learning approaches to build models capable of predicting short and long-term clinical outcomes. Our prediction models will be developed independently of our image processing algorithms. Upon achievement of Aims 1 and 2, automatically calculated information from CT scans will be incorporated into machine learning models. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance TBI care, specifically within the “golden hour"" post-injury. Ultimately, such a system has the potential to reduce delayed and missed diagnosis, thereby reducing TBI morbidity and mortality. Additionally, by preventing permanent and/or secondary injuries, and minimizing the time of hospitalization and rehabilitation, our system will contribute to reducing the annual $76 billion burden of TBI care in the U.S. In addition to innovation in the proposed approaches and their quantitative outputs, we aggregate four existing datasets to incorporate heterogeneity in both phenotypes and therapies, so the resulted model will be generalizable and applicable to real clinical settings. Project Narrative: Traumatic brain injury, frequently referred to as a silent epidemic, involves about 1.7 million people in the U.S, among whom 50,000 will die, while 152,000 will suffer from long-term disability and impairment. The proposed research will automatically diagnose and assess the severity of critical abnormalities from computed tomography head scan, and integrate all available sources of clinical data using data science methods to make a personalized data-driven prognosis. It is expected that this technology will provide caregivers with critical information for early and proper management of injuries, thus saving lives and improving the quality of life of survivors by reducing second/permanent injuries; importantly, this system would enable people living in outlying and deprived regions lacking skilled clinicians benefit from more accurate diagnostics, and as a result, a better care.",Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches,9757500,F31LM012946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'functional outcomes', 'human error', 'image processing', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2019,37153,0.0320314684285777
"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally. Decades of research have not found disease-modifying therapies except for a1 antitrypsin deficiency, a rare disease found by improved phenotyping, characterized by a specific emphysema subtype and caused by gene variants in SERPINA1. This renewal builds on the successful discovery of six new quantitative emphysema subtypes (QES), which were associated independently with greater symptoms, impaired function and increased mortality in addition to several genome-wide significant associations for gene variants. In the renewal, we propose to leverage over 27,000 CTs acquired over 5-7 years of follow-up from 4,500 highly phenotyped and genotyped participants to test if deep and unsupervised learning on new state-of- the-art CTs and CT angiograms will reveal additional deep-learned and molecular QES that suggest mechanistic pathways to treatment. Further, we will collect 60 explanted lungs and use state-of-the art microCT to test if QES have distinct histology and structure. Finally, we will recruit 100 patients undergoing lung cancer CT screening to test if QES will be translatable to clinical low-dose lung cancer screening CT scans acquired on contemporary scanners. Successful completion of these aims will discover new deep QES and molecular QES and validate and translate QES to further subphenotype emphysema and facilitate testing of personalize molecular therapies and, hopefully, replicate the success of therapy for a1-antitrypsin deficiency for more common emphysema subtypes. Project Narrative In the first funding period, we discovered six QES, which are independently associated with morbidity, mortality and distinct gene variants that suggest targetable molecular pathways. This renewal builds upon our successful UML approach with integration of DL, greatly increased CT and genetic data; validates QES with histology; and translates QES to the clinic in order to facilitate testing of molecular therapies of specific QES and to redefine emphysema subtypes in clinical practice.",Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS,9740637,R01HL121270,"['Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Apical', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Endothelium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Translating', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'c new', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computed tomography screening', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lung cancer screening', 'microCT', 'mortality', 'novel', 'population based', 'recruit', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,790346,-0.018773983781234942
"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9769734,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2019,228000,0.050321642227195006
"Ultraportable Stroke CT Based on Stationary Carbon Nanotube X-ray Source and Deep Learning Image Formation PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this 12-month SBIR phase 1 project is developing an imaging device that will enable highly efficient and cost-effective stroke imaging for patients suffered trauma events. The expected technical outcome will be a proof-of-concept head CT imaging system with sub- second imaging speed, sub-mSv radiation dose, and high-quality images. Imaging systems with such capabilities will address the current deficiency in timely diagnosis of stroke patients, and benefit society with higher efficiency and lower cost. Such imaging device will make a strong economic impact on the global head CT imaging market, which is estimated to be about $36 billion in the U.S. In a longer term, the novel imaging technology could be translated into markets for security screening, industry inspection, and dental imaging. This project is based on the recent research results by Dr. Cao's team under the support of an NSF CAREER award (PI Dr. Cao, 08/01/2014-07/31/2019, $400,000) and a Dr. Cao's Commonwealth Research Commercialization Fund (CRCF) award (Title: “Computed Tomography Without Moving Parts for Fast and Portable Biomedical Imaging”, 07/01/2017- 06/30/2019, $100,000). The project has a strong footing in intellectual property. The technology is protected by a few patent applications at the Virginia Tech, including US. 62/316649, “Ultrafast Micro-CT for Imaging Free-Moving Animals” (Inventor: Guohua Cao), and PCT/US2013/061049 and US14/429835, “System and Method of Stationary Source Computed Tomography” (Inventor: Guohua Cao, et. al.). In this project, the team will design and build a proof-of-concept head CT platform to test the feasibility of ultraportable and compact head CT based on the stationary carbon nanotube x-ray source design and deep learning image reconstruction algorithm. The expected outcomes from this project include demonstration of the feasibility for ultrafast, low dose, and diagnostic imaging capabilities for intracerebral hemorrhage in head phantoms (ICH), with potential automatic ICH identification through deep learning algorithm. A ready-to- prototype head CT device will be optimized and designed, and a corresponding business plan will be developed. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stroke is a common of death in the world at tremendous social and healthcare costs. Currently head CT is typically used for initial evaluation of stroke patients for signs of intracerebral hemorrhage.

"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives.

But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides which currently available solutions do not overcome.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack. This new research will allow doctors to better identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to avoid a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.",Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events,9688580,R01HL133616,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational algorithm', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Event', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Institution', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Language', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Reader', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Visceral fat', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'pericardial sac', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'routine imaging', 'sudden cardiac death']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,653101,0.11169960080511454
"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9755492,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'automated analysis', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,756169,0.04924601819505104
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,9881453,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2019,397500,0.11942729813124943
"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction.

"STAN-CT: Standardization and Normalization of CT images for Lung Cancer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and one of the most common cancers among both men and women in the United States. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging set the stage for radiomics to become an active emerging field in cancer research. However, the promise of radiomics is limited by a lack of image standardization tools, because computed tomography (CT) images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with customized acquisition parameters, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites. To overcome this challenge, especially for large-scale, multi-site radiomic studies, advanced algorithms are required to integrate, standardize, and normalize CT images from multiple sources. We propose to develop STAN-CT, a deep learning software package that can automatically standardize and normalize a large volume of diagnostic images to facilitate cross-site large-scale image feature extraction for lung cancer characterization and stratification. By precisely mitigating the differences in advanced radiomic features of CT images, STAN-CT will overcome research silos and promote medical image resource sharing, ultimately improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Our goal will be achieved through two Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a working prototype to standardize CT images. First, we will collect raw image data from lung cancer patients and reconstruct CT images using multiple image reconstruction parameters, and we will scan a multipurpose chest phantom along with five different nodule inserts. Then, we will develop and train STAN-CT for CT image standardization. An alternative training architecture will be developed to achieve the improved model training stability. In Aim 2. We will deploy and test STAN-CT for image standardization locally and across three medical centers. First, we will make the STAN-CT software package available to the public by providing a menu-driven web-interface so that that users can conveniently convert medical images that were taken using non-standard protocols to one or multiple standards that they specify. Second, we will deploy STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky for local performance validation. We will test the functionality, reliability, and performance of STAN-CT using both patient chest CT image data collected at large-scale and the phantom image data, both independent to training. Third, we will deploy and test STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky as well as the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Emory University for cross- center performance validation. We will use the same multipurpose chest phantom and both standard and non- standard protocols to validate STAN-CT at the three centers. We will test the generalizability of STAN-CT using clinical CT images of human patients and will determine whether a model trained using the data from one medical center are applicable for images collected at another place. Finally, we will distribute the software package of STAN-CT for public use. STAN-CT will enable a wide range of radiomic researches to identify diagnostic image features that strongly associated with lung cancer prognosis. Project Narrative Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most popular diagnostic image modalities routinely used for assessing anatomical tissue characteristics for disease management. However, CT images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with different imaging standards, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites.

"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT.

"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology.

"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9614825,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,826025,0.060861971994445395
"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the leading cause of heart disease and is associated with hypertension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) is comprised of structural and functional deficits of the tiny coronary arteries that may be an earlier indicator of disease prior to the onset of overt CAD. The proposed multidisciplinary research aims to develop a computational artificial intelligence model that will accurately predict CMD based on a non-invasive coronary flow pattern obtained by Doppler echocardiography.",Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease,9584176,R21EB026518,"['Address', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic mouse', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Doppler Echocardiography', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Elements', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hyperemia', 'Hypertension', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Publications', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'coronary perfusion', 'db/db mouse', 'diabetic', 'disorder prevention', 'early onset', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'macrovascular disease', 'mathematical model', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prevent']",NIBIB,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2018,190000,0.050321642227195006
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9475862,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2018,589455,0.09427655238714991
"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To develop and evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of new computational algorithms for automated quantification of EAT measures; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified EAT features, relative to atherosclerotic plaque burden and measures of obesity, for the prediction of future cardiac events in asymptomatic patients in the EISNER registry and the St. Francis Heart Study; 3) To derive and evaluate a new, integrated risk score—combining standard risk factors, coronary calcium score and EAT measures using machine learning—for the prediction of future cardiac events in the EISNER registry, and further, to additionally evaluate this risk score externally in the St. Francis Heart Study patient cohort.  This work in this proposal will provide a novel, personalized paradigm that will objectively and accurately identify asymptomatic patients undergoing coronary calcium scanning who are at increased risk for future cardiac events, without any additional imaging or risk to the patient. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) CT scanning of the heart for coronary calcium scoring is a simple, widely-used, low-cost test with low radiation dose. Using these scans, the researchers propose to establish automated analysis of fat which surrounds the heart, as well as novel computerized scores that identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack.

"Real-time Monitoring of Zebrafish ECG with Automated Aberrant Pattern Detection Abstract Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH STTR grant with University of Washington (UW) is to provide a flexible system to assess cardiac electrical activities in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Unlike humans, zebrafish hearts can fully regenerate following cardiac injury, thereby providing a tractable model system to study endogenous heart regeneration. Zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal vertebrate model system for phenotype-based screening owing to their physiological similarity to mammals. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves sedation causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. In this context, we propose and develop 1) a wireless flexible “jacket” to be worn by zebrafish for real-time assessment of electrical cardiac phenotypes, namely ECG; and 2) a simple-yet-novel apparatus to collect ECG of multiple awake fish. Our devices provide pivotal platforms for cardiac phenotype-related investigations. The obtained data will be processed by smart algorithms to detect aberrant ECG patterns in real time. The proposed systems will facilitate related studies using zebrafish models. Further, the success of this platform also paves the avenue for regenerative medicine and developmental biology studies as well as stem cell-based therapies for cardiac repair. In Phase I of this STTR grant, we will develop i) a polymer-based microelectrode array (MEA) jacket that could be comfortably worn by the zebrafish and provide wireless ECG acquisition; and ii) a 4-chamber apparatus for simultaneous recording of ECG in awake fish. Machine learning-based programs with embedded algorithms will be developed to distinguish ECG patterns such as heart rate, ST and QT intervals, thus can identify anomalies, such as arrhythmias or prolonged QTs. For proof of concept, the system will be validated and compared. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase I STTR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of Washington will develop 1) a world-first wireless flexible membrane for zebrafish with a micro-electrode array (MEA) for ECG measurement and electronics for wireless powering and communication with an external unit; 2) a simple-yet-novel 4-chamber apparatus to acquire ECG of 4 awake fish; and 3) Machine learning-based programs to process the data and detect desired patterns. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based screening in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous studies.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9476341,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,770494,0.06730715155399443
"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9539728,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,756791,0.04924601819505104
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,9477411,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation induced damage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'public health relevance', 'radiation risk', 'radiological imaging', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,245857,0.09109209403322202
"Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction Abstract:  The use of CT scans has recently increased, for example, in virtual colonoscopy, CT cardiac screening, screening of the lung in smokers, whole-body CT in asymptomatic patients, and CT imaging of children. Shortening of the scanning time to around 1 second, eliminating the strict need for the subject to remain still or be sedated, is one of the main reasons for the large increase in the pediatric population. CT scans of children have been estimated to produce non-negligible increases in the probability of lifetime cancer mortality, leading to calls for the use of reduced current settings for CT scans of children. For these reasons, the CT industry has put in a lot of effort to develop low-dose CT. One active area of research is methods to reduce the radiation counts by applying adaptive collimation to block unnecessary x-ray photons. Another active area of research is the development of more robust image reconstruction algorithms that are less sensitive to noise for low-count data.  This grant proposal is focused on the second approach — development of fast and robust reconstruction algorithms. It is known that some iterative image reconstruction algorithms outperform the analytical filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm in terms of producing less-noisy images with the same data set. One disadvantage of these iterative algorithms is their long computation time, making them impractical in a real- world CT reconstruction tasks. For this reason, the FBP algorithm is still the main work horse for CT applications.  The main goal of the proposed research is to develop fast and robust iterative-algorithms so that their computation time is at the same order of an analytic FBP algorithm, using experimental low-dose phantom, cadaver data, and low-dose cancer screen chest CT patient data to perform comparison studies. We will answer the question: When the fast and robust algorithms are used, how much can the CT dose be reduced while retaining the image quality of a standard-dose CT produced by the conventional FBP?  This R15 project provides Weber State University (WSU) computer engineering and computer science students with hands-on opportunities and experiences of performing real-world research in the field of healthcare. It will stimulate the interests of students so that they consider a career in biomedical and bioengineering field/industry. Narrative:  CT dose is currently a major concern for the general public. Low-dose CT is under development. The proposed research will focus on developing fast, robust and practical image reconstruction methods that are able to produce a standard CT image using a lower CT dose.",Fast and Robust Low-Dose X-Ray CT Image Reconstruction,9440734,R15EB024283,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cadaver', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equus caballus', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Inferior', 'Internships', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'low-dose spiral CT', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'parallel computer', 'professor', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'tomography', 'university student']",NIBIB,WEBER STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2018,88321,0.1275320123043952
"System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion Summary BioInVision, Inc. and Case Western Reserve University researchers will develop software for quantitative anal- ysis of cardiac CT perfusion (CCTP), creating an important tool for evaluation of cardiovascular disease. With this product, cardiologists will be able to identify functional flow deficits in coronary artery territories. When one combines functional myocardial blood flow (MBF) with coronary anatomy from computed tomography angi- ography (CTA), it provides needed information on the physiologic significance of a stenosis. The CTA+CCTP combo could provide an ideal gateway exam for deciding whether to send a patient for percutaneous invasive coronary angiography and potential intervention (e.g., stenting). In addition, if flow is low and no stenosis is present, it will suggest microvascular disease, a very prevalent ailment of growing concern, especially among women and in diabetes. CT compares favorably to all other non-invasive cardiovascular imaging techniques (SPECT, PET, and MRI). It is available in many settings, including emergency departments. It provides both MBF and reliable coronary anatomy, not available in any other single modality. It has excellent resolution ena- bling detection of endocardial perfusion deficit, thought to be an early disease indicator that is impossible to assess with SPECT. CT is cheaper and has higher patient throughput than MRI or PET. With inclusion of MBF, CT would have an excellent opportunity to disrupt the diagnostic pathway leading to percutaneous intervention, a pathway now dominated by SPECT myocardial imaging, which includes zero information about coronary anatomy. To achieve reliable, accurate CT MBF measurements, we will invoke innovations to reduce beam hardening and to make reliable estimates of flow. Currently, CT perfusion is done on different CT machines with manufacturers’ proprietary software, using algorithms that can give erroneous MBFs. Applicable to any commercial scanner; our solution would harmonize measurements across acquisition systems providing trust- worthy, standardized measurements to clinicians, thereby improving management of cardiovascular patients. Narrative We will develop software to enable reliable evaluation of blood flow in heart tissue using CT imaging. With suc- cess, our project could lead to an improved gateway examination that could reduce unnecessary invasive cor- onary angiography, thereby reducing costs, patient discomfort, patient risk, and possibly unnecessary interven- tional therapies.",System-independent quantitative cardiac CT perfusion,9622204,R41HL144271,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary artery', 'Cost Savings', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inferior', 'Intervention', 'Iodine', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Obesity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stents', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'blood flow measurement', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cost', 'design', 'detector', 'digital', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'perfusion imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,"BIOINVISION, INC.",R41,2018,224240,0.12931126433270768
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9417961,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'heart function', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'procedure cost', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,658634,0.09005258540136711
"Automated coronary artery calcification scoring for cardiovascular risk screening ABSTRACT The World Health Organization lists cardiovascular disease as the most common cause of death worldwide at 31% of all deaths. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring has become the most reliable predictor of future coronary artery disease (CAD) events in the asymptomatic population. CAC scores are currently only reported on ECG-gated CT examinations that are ordered when the primary indication is cardiac in nature. However, in 2007 there were 7.1 million non-cardiac thoracic CT scans ordered with lungs as the primary indication where CAC scores could have been reported. An additional 7-10 million CT lung screening scans are expected to be ordered per year as lung screening programs grow. Because lung cancer risk factors and CAD risk factors overlap significantly, most these patients could benefit greatly from having their CAC score reported as part of their non-cardiac CT examination. This could dramatically improve decision making, quality of care, and lower expenses due to future CAD interventions and cardiac specific CT scans. The goal of this project is to develop a fully automated software application that can report CAC scores on both gated and ungated thoracic CT scans with seamless integration into the Radiology workflow. A successful completion of this project will deliver a product capable of dramatically increasing the number of people that receive early intervention for CAD, thereby increasing quality of care and lowering costs. This Phase I application proposes first creating an algorithm capable of automatically calculating global CAC scores from both ECG-gated and ungated CT scans using CAC segmentations performed by an expert physician. If successful, the Phase II project will perform robust clinical validation adequate for an FDA 510(k) submission.

"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9281894,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2017,593963,0.09427655238714991
"Computerized Visualization and Prediction of Coronary Artery Ischemia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality. In the US, CAD affects >16 million adults and accounts for >1/3 deaths annually. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a non-invasive option for imaging coronary arteries and myocardial perfusion. Nevertheless, diagnosis of ischemic CAD based on CT alone is less robust due to the lack of lesion-specific physiologic information. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied to image-based modeling of patient-specific geometry from CT data, which now allows for non-invasive calculation of coronary pressure, flow and shear stress, and thus lesion-specific evaluation of coronary ischemia in higher diagnostic accuracy than the strategy based on CT alone. There is a pressing need to incorporate CT imaging, image-based modeling, and CFD into clinical practice for better diagnosis of coronary ischemia. However, progress has been thwarted by three major challenges: (1) lack of integrated tools to visualize immense data to assist diagnosis, (2) inabiliy to quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for optimal prediction of ischemia, and (3) lack of comprehensive clinically relevant evaluation. In this proposal, we will develop and evaluate a novel computerized system to improve visual and predictive assessment of coronary ischemia from CT imaging and CFD. To accomplish this goal: (1) We will create tools to visualize coronary anatomy, physiology and myocardial perfusion for routine diagnosis assistance; The evaluation will be performed by comparing the diagnostic performance of two experienced cardiologists using our visualization tool and the conventional workstation using invasive ground truths; (2) We will develop methods to automatically quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for maximizing predictive accuracy using machine learning. The evaluation will be assessed through cross-validation on a large existing database with respect to invasive ground truths.

"Automated quantitative CT imaging of epicardial adipose tissue and risk of cardiac events PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering acute myocardial infarction have no prior symptoms. Coronary calcium scoring with non-contrast CT is increasingly used for cardiovascular risk stratification in the asymptomatic population. Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), a local visceral fat depot surrounding the heart, has been recently reported as a significant imaging biomarker for cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite being routinely imaged noninvasively by non-contrast cardiac CT for coronary calcium scoring, EAT features are currently not measured or reported, primarily due to the absence of robust, automated quantification methods.  We propose to employ novel image processing algorithms to achieve fully automated, robust quantification of EAT features from cardiac CT, and to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine patient clinical data, coronary calcium and EAT features into a new integrated risk score to predict future cardiac events. We will evaluate this risk score in two existing, prospective registries of asymptomatic patients with available coronary calcium scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiac events (myocardial infarction, cardiac death, late revascularization). These rich resources are: the Early Identification of Subclinical Atherosclerosis Using Non-Invasive Imaging Research [EISNER] registry (2614 patients) and the St. Francis Heart Study (4613 patients).

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9268035,R01HL122484,"['3D ultrasound', '4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'perfusion imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2017,770494,0.06730715155399443
"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,9382827,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,771431,0.04924601819505104
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,9246984,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation induced damage', 'Radiation therapy', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'public health relevance', 'radiation risk', 'radiological imaging', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,60564,0.09109209403322202
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9229057,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'post intervention', 'public health relevance', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,680651,0.09005258540136711
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,9043186,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2016,599020,0.09427655238714991

"Computerized Visualization and Prediction of Coronary Artery Ischemia ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality. In the US, CAD affects >16 million adults and accounts for >1/3 deaths annually. Recently, computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a non-invasive option for imaging coronary arteries and myocardial perfusion. Nevertheless, diagnosis of ischemic CAD based on CT alone is less robust due to the lack of lesion-specific physiologic information. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied to image-based modeling of patient-specific geometry from CT data, which now allows for non-invasive calculation of coronary pressure, flow and shear stress, and thus lesion-specific evaluation of coronary ischemia in higher diagnostic accuracy than the strategy based on CT alone. There is a pressing need to incorporate CT imaging, image-based modeling, and CFD into clinical practice for better diagnosis of coronary ischemia. However, progress has been thwarted by three major challenges: (1) lack of integrated tools to visualize immense data to assist diagnosis, (2) inabiliy to quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for optimal prediction of ischemia, and (3) lack of comprehensive clinically relevant evaluation. In this proposal, we will develop and evaluate a novel computerized system to improve visual and predictive assessment of coronary ischemia from CT imaging and CFD. To accomplish this goal: (1) We will create tools to visualize coronary anatomy, physiology and myocardial perfusion for routine diagnosis assistance; The evaluation will be performed by comparing the diagnostic performance of two experienced cardiologists using our visualization tool and the conventional workstation using invasive ground truths; (2) We will develop methods to automatically quantify and select salient anatomic and physiologic features for maximizing predictive accuracy using machine learning. The evaluation will be assessed through cross-validation on a large existing database with respect to invasive ground truths. If successful, our developments will provide a new computerized system to assist the diagnosis of coronary ischemia by visualizing the totality of anatomic and physiologic findings over current unassisted approaches, and predict ischemia by machine learning methods that are superior to current heuristic techniques, and ultimately accelerate the translation of diagnostic performance gain into routine clinical practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the principal cause of morbidity and mortality. Based on computed tomography and computational fluid dynamics, our proposed work will create and evaluate a new computerized system to improve the diagnosis of ischemic CAD by developing advanced visualization and prediction tools.        ",Computerized Visualization and Prediction of Coronary Artery Ischemia,9093071,R21HL132277,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Ischemia', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Echocardiography', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Ischemia', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nuclear', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Stenosis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'shear stress', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NHLBI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2016,254250,0.022056849225970048
"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.  In 4D reconstruction, a computer algorithm tracks the heart's beating motion, and uses this information to improve image quality by smoothing image noise in a way that preserves image details. In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern. This project will investigate software methods that may allow the radiation dose in cardiac SPECT imaging to be reduced by a factor of eight or more. This will be accomplished by: optimizing the image processing that is used, further developing new and better image processing methods, and developing a method of ""personalized imaging"", in which, for each individual patient, the minimum amount of imaging agent needed to obtain a good image is computed.",Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging,9061011,R01HL122484,"['4D Imaging', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Evaluation', 'Financial compensation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Protection', 'Radioactive', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'predictive modeling', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2016,770494,0.06730715155399443
"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,9056996,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Endoscopy', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,306421,0.09109209403322202
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,9004651,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'standard of care', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,658634,0.09005258540136711
"Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. The goal of this proposal is to develop and provide a new analysis technique for understanding the complex cardiac motion patterns (in time and space) of patients with cardiac dyssynchrony, with the hope of improving its treatment outcomes, specifically with respect to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). CRT, the most effective treatment for dyssynchrony with worsening heart failure, significantly improves outcome in only ~66% of heart failure patients selected for the treatment, which is based on ECG criteria. Selection criteria based on imaging are essential to improving the success rate. Unfortunately, response rates are not higher with selection criteria based on echocardiography, the most popular cardiac imaging technique. Cine cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) has the potential to better characterize dyssynchrony, as it shows cardiac mechanics and intramural wall motion with much higher spatial resolution than echocardiography. However, quantitative assessments of CMR have been mostly limited to global volumetric measures, which ignore most of the motion information captured by the images. For example, studies of a number of distinctive motion features of dyssynchrony (such as septal flash and apical rocking) have been confined to qualitative assessment, limiting inference of their potential utility for improving CRT treatment. To accurately quantify cardiac function through CMR, we have developed biomechanical models for describing cardiac function and machine learning technology for identifying morphological and functional patterns atypical for healthy hearts. We propose to combine these two technologies to accurately quantify cardiac dyssynchrony within the Left Ventricle (LV). Specifically, our methods will extract a rich description of LV motion and strain from the CMRs of a set of retrospectively selected subjects with synchronous or dyssynchronous LV motion. We will then use machine learning methods to identify local and global motion patterns specific to dyssynchrony. Finally, we will correlate these patterns to already existing clinical scores to find potentially predictive markers with respect to CRT outcome. We hypothesize that these markers will have a higher correlation to CRT outcome than current clinical markers alone. Identifying these markers will have the potential to further stratify the disease with respect to the expected outcome of CRT, which then can be used to derive new selection criteria that lead to higher success rates. The project will also disseminate our novel, data-driven methodology for quantifying that motion. Other research groups can apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases impacting LV motion in general.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy, as the current clinical selection criteria are too broad. Our goal is to more accurately characterize the complex shape and motion patterns of cardiac dyssynchrony, through new machine learning technology applied to dynamic cardiovascular magnetic resonance images. We envision that our findings would further improve both our understanding of cardiac dyssynchrony in relation to heart failure and the ability to predict its response to resynchronization therapy, potentially leading to new clinical guidelines and improved clinical outcomes.            ",Innovative MRI-based Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony,8875394,R01HL127661,"['Apical', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'cardiovascular visualization', 'effective therapy', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2015,634258,0.09427655238714991

In respiratory motion compensation, the patient's breathing and body motions are tracked by external sensors, and this information is used to reduce the appearance of motion blur in the images, and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy. The proposed ""personalized imaging"" approach builds on our group's extensive experience in machine learning.  We expect that the combination of these various strategies will greatly reduce radiation dose, and because the improvements are based on software, the cost of these enhancements is very low. The project will result in recommendations for image reconstruction algorithms and parameters to be used in the clinic, along with corresponding tracer dose recommendations. The ""personalized imaging"" method will be implemented as a user-friendly computer program that customizes the dose for each given patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Radiation exposure of patients via medical imaging has become a significant concern.

"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent.

"Dynamic-CT-based biomarker for predicting clinical outcome in CRC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. A patient's five-year survival rate depend on the tumor stage at the time of diagnosis, and stage of the tumor plays a substantial role in decision-making regarding treatment. Thus, precise pre-treatment diagnostic evaluation and staging of colorectal cancer are important. In addition, angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of growth and metastasis in CRC and is reported as a useful prognostic marker, similar to many other carcinomas. Thus, in vivo quantification of the tumor angiogenesis rate holds promise in improving the management of CRC. Perfusion computed tomography (PCT) acquires high temporal resolution images, thus enabling evaluation of hemodynamic changes of tissue in vivo by modeling tracer kinetics. PCT has been reported to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and to be a more sensitive imaging biomarker for predicting of overall survival (OS) of CRC patients than conventional tumor staging. In clinical practice, however, the PCT protocol is a trade-off between high-temporal resolution and the total radiation dose required. Thus, the use of dynamic CT imaging derived from four temporal phases, which include pre-contrast, arterial, portal, and delayed phases, is highly desirable, because it is more readily available and yields substantially lower radiation exposure to the patients than that of PCT. However, low temporal resolution in four-phase dynamic CT presents several barriers in modeling tracer kinetics, primarily because of the lack of temporal enhancement information, which limits the ability to obtain reliable physiological information. We will thus develop a novel continuous-time modeling of tracer kinetics without any discretization of the enhancement curves. Such an approach will enable estimation of the time lag between onset time points of input and response enhancements as well as other kinetic parameters in four-phase dynamic CT. We hypothesize that the proposed tracer kinetic model can be an effective imaging biomarker for the risk stratification of recurrence of CRC and for prediction of OS. To explore these hypotheses, the specific aims of the proposed project are (1) Develop a novel single-input continuous-time tracer kinetic model without any discretization to fit temporal enhancement curves in four-phase dynamic CT of the colon, and (2) develop kinetic-model-based imaging biomarkers from four-phase dynamic CT and evaluate their performance in predicting clinical outcome in CRC patients.

"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Heart transplant (Tx) surgery is a well-established life-saving procedure, but is associated with post- interventional risks such as acute cardiac rejection (ACR) which is one of the leading causes of death in the first year after transplant. Beyond the first year, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the single greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality. Monitoring the patient for post-transplant events is thus paramount. The standard monitoring strategy, however, relies on frequent (12-16 monitoring nodes during year 1 alone) invasive and costly procedures including endomyocardial biopsies (EMB) and catheter angiography. Since EMB and catheter angiography have limited sensitivity due to sampling errors (ACR) or the diffuse nature of the disease (CAV), a reliable non-invasive alternative for the early detection of ACR and CAV would be desirable to reduce the need for invasive procedures, improve sensitivity, and reduce cost. We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with te status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,8797337,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost utility', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,596707,0.09005258540136711
"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.

"Probing Dose Limits in Cardiac SPECT with Reconstruction and Personalized Imaging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Radiation exposure of patients during medical imaging has become a major concern, with computed tomography (CT) and cardiac single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) being the biggest contributors. In this project our aim will be to dramatically reduce radiation dose in cardiac SPECT MPI based on inexpensive software techniques that can be translated readily to clinical practice. Our initial results suggest that at least an eightfold reduction in radiation doe might be possible, which could lead to an estimated reduction of 6500 cancer deaths per year in the U.S. alone.  In lay terms, cardiac SPECT MPI is used routinely to evaluate heart disease, allowing the physician to assess blood flow reaching the heart wall, the motion of the heart, and whether the heart wall's tissue is viable. This form of imaging involves administration of a radioactive pharmaceutical (tracer) to the patient, which exposes the patient to radiation; thus, i would be desirable to minimize tracer dose used during imaging. Image quality is determined by the amount of tracer used, and these levels were chosen prior to recent technological improvements that can produce high-quality images at lower dose; therefore, there is clear evidence that doses can be lowered, and indeed there is considerable current interest in doing so.  We are proposing a translational research project to thoroughly and quantitatively study the extent to which administered dose might be reduced without sacrificing image quality. This work will build, in particular, on new four-dimensional (4D) image reconstruction techniques and respiratory motion compensation approaches we have developed. Furthermore, we propose a new dosing approach we call ""personalized imaging"", in which a computer algorithm will be trained to predict, for a given patient, the minimum dose required to obtain the current level of image quality, so that the administered dose is no more than necessary.

We have recently developed and applied cardiac MRI techniques for the non-invasive assessment of myocardial edema (T2-mapping), diffuse fibrosis (pre- and post-contrast T1-mapping), myocardial velocities (tissue phase mapping), and microvascular quantitative perfusion. We have shown that these techniques can identify distinct regional structural and functional alterations in the heart that correlate with the status of the allograft. Based on these findings, a detailed cost-effective analysis using Markov modeling and decision tree analysis has demonstrated that cardiac MR has tremendous potential to reduce monitoring costs by 40-50% during the first year after Tx alone. This proposal builds on these promising findings and our aim is to develop an new 15-minute structure-function cardiac MRI protocol for the improved detection regional abnormalities associated with ACR (edema, fibrosis, dysfunction) and CAV (perfusion, dysfunction). Integration of MRI with echocardiography and intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) will provide unique multi-modality assessment of the allograft. The application in a longitudinal clinical study coupled with state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analysis will allow redefining the most effective post-Tx mixed monitoring strategy. The aim is to to help clinicians identify the optimal mixed monitoring strategy, i.e. the optimal combination of multi-modality imaging (structure-function MRI, echo, IVUS) and invasive procedures (EMB, catheter angiography) which provide best outcome (quality adjusted life days) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to develop a multi-modality imaging protocol for the non-invasive characterization of tissue and function of the left and right heart in patients after heart transplantation. Our aim is to develop a new non- invasive 15 minute diagnostic test in order to provide a previously unattainable quantitative characterization of myocardial structure-function deficits in cardiac transplant patients. The application in a longitudinal clinial study coupled with cost-effectiveness analysis and decision tree modeling will allow to improve current monitoring strategies by combining cardiac MRI, echocardiography, intravascular ultrasound and invasive tests (biopsy, catheter angiography) to provide the best outcome (quality of life days, mortality) and lowest cost for the individual cardiac transplant patient.            ",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,8630169,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Allografting', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling Errors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'base', 'comparative', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'extracellular', 'follow-up', 'heart allograft', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'two-arm study']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,467351,0.08883930864899463
"Quantitative PET/CT Analysis to Improve Evaluation of Tumor Response     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer. In Aim 1, we will extract comprehensive spatial and temporal features of a tumor from PET/CT images and evaluate their ability in predicting tumor response to CRT. These features will quantify the spatial characteristics of a tumor along with their changes due to CRT, adding a great amount of information to the current non-volumetric PET/CT response measures. Also, we will use image registration techniques to align pre-CRT images with post-CRT images, making it possible to quantify the spatial changes at the original tumor site. In Aim 2, we will construct and test reliable predictive models of tumo response to CRT using machine learning techniques with spatial- temporal PET/CT features, clinical parameters and demographics as input. The models will identify an optimal subset of predictive features and utilize PET and CT information in chorus. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel multi-modality adaptive region-growing algorithm for tumor delineation in PET/CT. We will compare the accuracy and precision of the resulting predictive models against those in which tumor is delineated using conventional methods (manual contouring or thresholding). This comparison will help us understand to what degree the prediction of tumor response depends on the tumor delineation methods. Finally, we will use pathologic response and survival as the end points and ground truth to cross-validate each predictive model. If all aims are achieved, the proposed PET/CT image analysis framework may provide a highly accurate diagnostic tool. This, will complement other diagnostic tests in assisting physicians in making a treatment decision to more appropriately select patients for surgery, thus avoiding the mortality and morbidity of surgery in responders for whom surgery can be safely deferred; while improving local control and survival in non- responders for whom surgery should be considered. Therefore, this work has the potential to improve outcomes by safely deferring surgery which will improve our locally advanced esophageal cancer patient's quality of life while simultaneously reducing costs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose to develop and validate a quantitative Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (PET/CT) image analysis framework to improve the evaluation of esophageal tumor response to chemoradiotherapy.

"Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  Modern radiation therapy treatment planning relies on volumetric (CT, or sometimes MRI) imaging to determine tumor location and spread. In addition, radiation oncologists treating head and neck cancer have long used a specific endoscopy - nasopharyngoscopy - to augment the treatment planning volumetric scan. In endoscopy, a thin, flexible light-pipe with a camera is inserted into the patient to obtain optical videos. Endoscopy is done because it is clear to the experienced clinician that direct visualization of a tumor and the surrounding anatomy can reveal valuable information not seen on CT or MRI scans. However, there is currently no way for the clinician to delineate the tumor volume on the endoscopic video and have that information placed correctly into the CT dataset used for treatment planning. Also, there is currently no way to view a combined CT/video dataset. Such a registration has not yet been accomplished in part because of the formidable problems of accurately registering a video taken during nasopharyngoscopy with a planning CT scan. In this proposal we will create a new method to register CT scans with endoscopic videos to produce a fused representation that can then displayed to the clinician to improve radiation treatment planning. To accomplish this, we will further develop and integrate methods of deformable registration, mechanical modeling, motion estimation, computer vision, and 3D interactive display. With such software, radiation treatment planning will have an entirely new and complementary source of information with which to determine tumor extent. Although outside the direct scope of this project, we believe that this technology can be extended to other parts of human anatomy and can be useful for surgical planning as well as radiation treatment planning.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop advanced image processing and display technologies and integrate them in such a way as to allow a clinician to simultaneously view fused internal photographs of the patient's throat and voice box along with the corresponding CT scans. Such a system will result in better tumor targeting for cancer patients undergoing radiation treatment of that part of the body. More accurate treatment will likely result in a highe cure rate for these cancers.            ",Integration of endoscopic and CT data for radiation therapy treatment planning,8439269,R01CA158925,"['Anatomy', 'Body part', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Endoscopy', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Larynx', 'Light', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Nasopharyngoscopy', 'Nose', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Physical Examination', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Relative (related person)', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'data structure', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'head and neck cancer patient', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tissue phantom', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2013,306421,0.09109209403322202
"Spatially Accurate Deformable Image Registration for Thoracic C Applications    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)   Abstract:  Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cross-cutting technology with diagnostic and therapeutic medical applications. DIR algorithms were first developed in computer vision research to estimate motion between a source and target image, the resulting registered image visually appears similar to the target image. For medical applications the goal in applying DIR is to obtain an accurate spatial registration of the underlying anatomy and not simply image similarity. We developed a statistical framework for quantitative evaluation of DIR spatial accuracy based on large samples of expert-determined landmark features. Central to this framework is the statistical relationship between the number of landmark points required to assess spatial accuracy, the desired uncertainty range of the mean error, and an a priori estimated behavior of the DIR. DIR is at the heart of our strategy to quantify COPD small airway disease air-trapping and four dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) ventilation. The optimal DIR algorithm and its spatial accuracy in registering the underlying anatomy should be assessed for each application. We will develop and test new DIR algorithms for exhale and inhale breath-hold CT (eBH-CT & iBH-CT) images pairs (COPD air trapping evaluation) and for 4D CT images (4D CT ventilation). Current CT image analysis methods for COPD evaluation focus on the separate anatomic evaluation of the eBH-CT & iBH-CT images. They are unable to find air-trapping due to bronchiolitis alone. We propose to evaluate the eBH- & iBH CT image pairs simultaneously using DIR to link the two to identify regions of air-trapping due to both emphysema and bronchiolitis. Next, to continue our development of ventilation imaging derived from 4D CT, we will test the ability of 4D CT ventilation image guidance to reduce pulmonary function loss after radiotherapy in a randomized phase II trial for non-small cell lung cancer patients.    Public Health Relevance:  This study will develop novel image registration methods and their application, with an emphasis on application specific validation. With this technology we will develop and test methods to find air-trapping in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. We will test our novel ventilation imaging method in radiation treatment planning to reduce normal lung injury after treatment for lung cancer.      ",Spatially Accurate Deformable Image Registration for Thoracic C Applications,8558551,DP2OD007044,"['4D Imaging', 'Aftercare', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Breathing', 'Bronchiolitis', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Exhalation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Link', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Patients', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Vision research', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abstracting', 'base', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary function', 'small airways disease', 'treatment planning']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,DP2,2013,201518,0.0792662224212914
"Robust BCT for Clinical Use    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a major public health threat for over 50% of the population over age 50. Despite its importance, osteoporosis is largely under-treated, with less than 20% of those recommended for testing being screened. With substantial reimbursement cuts being introduced by Medicare for bone densitometry by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, the current clinical standard), with a sensitivity of DXA for fracture prediction of less than 50%, and with the rapidly increasing size of the aging population of the U.S., there is an urgent need for additional and more sensitive modalities than DXA for clinical assessment of fracture risk. Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) has emerged as a powerful alternative to DXA. This CT-based technology creates a structural ""finite element"" model of a patient's bone from their CT scans, and subjects that model to virtual forces in order to provide an estimate of the strength of the bone. Well validated in cadaver studies and being a better predictor of bone strength than is bone mineral density by DXA, BCT has also been shown to be highly predictive of osteoporotic fractures in clinical research studies. However, robustness remains an issue - can the technique be used easily by non-experts in research and clinical environments? Addressing this issue, the overall goal of this research is to improve the robustness of our software, such that it can automatically analyze scans from a wide range of CT scanners and using a wide variety of CT acquisition protocols, including new low-dose protocols that limit radiation exposure to the patient. Such a robust BCT diagnostic tool could then be offered as a supplementary ""add-on"" analysis to many types of CT exams taken for other purposes such as CT colonography, pelvic, abdominal, and spine exams, thus reducing hospital costs, incurring no addition radiation to the patient, requiring no change in the CT acquisition protocols, and therefore greatly increasing the number of patients that could be screened at low cost. Specifically, we propose in this Phase-I project to combine expertise in computer vision, CT scanning, and biomechanics in order to develop an automated method of ""phantomless"" cross-calibration of CT scans for robust vertebral strength assessment. Focusing on the spine, our major tasks are to perform a series of clinical studies in which patients are scanned twice using a variety of CT acquisition protocols; develop a custom external-calibration phantom and use that to determine the effects of various CT acquisition parameters on scanning standardization; and use machine learning techniques to develop a ""statistical atlas"" of the spine for automation of all image processing. We will combine these efforts to develop a phantomless BCT method that accounts for differences in image quality due to variations in CT scanners and acquisition protocols, including low-dose protocols, and that does so in a highly automated fashion requiring minimal user expertise and input. Should this project be successful, future work will further refine the techniques, extend them to the hip and quantitative analysis of muscle and other soft tissues, and address robustness of longitudinal changes for clinical monitoring.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With a mortality rate up to 30% one year after hip fracture, and an economic burden exceeding $17 billion annually, osteoporotic fracture is a debilitating condition whose impact on our aging society is growing. Early identification of those at risk for fracture can guide prevention and treatment, and BCT will provide a means for such detection with a sensitivity and specificity lacking in DXA based bone densitometry. The greater radiation exposure from CT, however, limits the market for such a diagnostic. The proposed project will result in a robust diagnostic test that significantly lowers radiation dose to the patient, and in some implementations, completely eliminates additional radiation by using CT scans already ordered for other medical purposes. Successful development of this product will broaden the pool of individuals who will benefit from a more accurate and sensitive fracture risk prediction, expand the market for O. N.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge.

"AUTOMATIC QUANTITATIVE CT IMAGING OF PERICARDIAL FAT: A NOVEL ISCHEMIA PREDICTOR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, 1 million people in the US will experience a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. A large percentage of these patients have no prior symptoms of any kind but suffer from silent heart disease (ischemia), which may cause a heart attack at any time. Currently there is no reliable screening method to identify people who may have silent heart disease and therefore are at risk of ""heart attack"".       We seek to extract additional data from a non-invasive Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the heart (commonly used in most imaging centers), which will better identify patients who are ""vulnerable"" to sudden heart attack. These images are acquired without contrast agents, as a common screening test for measuring coronary calcium, another clinical marker of coronary artery disease. We will prove that additional information about cardiovascular risk can be obtained by quantifying pericardial fat surrounding the heart in these cardiac CT images. Although this information exists in the cardiac CT scans acquired today, it is ignored in clinical practice because currently there are no tools to measure it automatically and reliably, and no information regarding its significance for a given patient.       We will develop fully automated, accurate, new computer software for quantitation of pericardial fat from cardiac CT images acquired for routine assessment of coronary calcium. We plan to achieve complete automation and accuracy, by applying a combination of robust and effective algorithms in machine learning with anatomical knowledge. We aim to prove that the developed automatic software will be as accurate, and more reproducible than experienced imaging physicians in quantifying pericardial fat, and will accomplish the measurement in a fraction of the time.

"Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred.

"Sub-millimeter Simultaneous SPECT-CT for Imaging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    We are proposing to develop a single, bench-top animal scanner that will acquire both functional SPECT images and anatomical CT images with sub-millimeter spatial resolution for both imaging modalities. The sub-mm SPECT-CT will provide a technique for noninvasive functional imaging in mice for a wide range of applications, including the development of new radio-pharmaceuticals, assessment of new therapeutic approaches, and investigation of fundamental biological processes in transgenic and knockout mice. This would allow investigators to perform serial imaging studies in the same animal at multiple time points to investigate tumor growth, tissue pathology, the effects of therapy, and the mechanism of action of new diagnostic agents. The system will have wide applicability and significant impact in research that uses small animals to advance our understanding of human disease processes. During phase I we successfully completed all proposed feasibility studies to demonstrate SPECT/CT with gamma performance of 1.3mm intrinsic spatial resolution, E range from 30keV to 350keV, and,deltaE/E=12% at 140keV and - 100mu m CT capability from a 50xS0mm CMOS based digital x-ray detector. In addition, we acquired outstanding dual SPECT-CT images of euthanized mice. During the phase II project we will complete the integration of the high-resolution SPECT and transmission CT subsystems and develop all necessary hardware and software.

"Accelerated x-ray therapy planning system PEREGRINE DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Computerized radiation therapy planning systems (RTP) are essential in Radiation Oncology for quantitative evaluation of radiation doses prior to patient treatment. Among currently available computational methods, the Monte Carlo method of calculating dose distributionsis most universal and accurate. It is believed that Monte Carlo software packages will become a central part of future RTP systems. The limiting problem with current Monte Carlo codes is the length of time (CPU time) required for calculations even when using state-of-the-art hardware. An increase in efficiency of Monte Carlo codes has been demonstrated using algorithms known as variance-reduction techniques (VR techniques), but the calculation times are still too long for routine  clinical use. While there is no single VR technique that would make Monte Carlo code clinically viable, a combination of such techniques usually results in improved performance. At present, the only commercial RTP system using Monte Carlo code for photon dose calculations is PEREGRINE from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NOMOS Corporation. PEREGRINE uses several VR techniques. However, it is estimated that a further reduction in CPU time by a factor of 10 would be required to have a clinically efficient system.  Our theoretical study and subsequent Monte Carlo results support a new variance-reduction technique (NVR) for photon-beam dose calculations. It is shown that NVR yields up to a 5-fold reduction in CPU time. The long-term objective of the project is to reduce PEREGRIN's CPU time from currently several hours to several; minutes. This will require a combination of NVR with other VR techniques. Within this scope, the specific aims of Phase I are:  1. Development, implementation and validation of a PEREGRINE-specific NVR algorithm.  2. Benchmarking of NVR over the range of clinically useful energies in homogeneous and heterogeneous phantoms.  3. Validation of NVR in the case of patient-specific Monte Carlo calculations using CT based patient anatomy. n/a",Accelerated x-ray therapy planning system PEREGRINE,6787955,R41CA108088,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'computed axial tomography', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'electromagnetic radiation', 'mathematics', 'patient care planning', 'radiation dosage', 'radiation therapy', 'technology /technique development']",NCI,NOMOS CORPORATION,R41,2004,100000,0.01709774285699626

"Vessel Segmentation/Registration from Ultrasound Images    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Ultrasound is widely used for imaging of blood vessels as it is non-invasive, real-time, and relatively inexpensive. This proposal focuses on segmentation of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) from ultrasound images with extension to other vascular imaging applications in the long term. Reliable quantitative evaluation of AAAs plays a pivotal role in diagnoses and frequent follow-up studies needed to avoid life-threatening rupture. These studies require vessel segmentation (for size analysis) and registration between serial studies (for monitoring the progression of the disease before and/or after vascular repair). AAA evaluation is routinely carried out for both high-risk patient populations and those treated with endovascular repair. Currently, AAA management is primarily based on measurements from two-dimensional (2-D) slices in CT scans. AAA monitoring and follow-up could be improved by 1) measurement from 3-D reconstructions, and 2) use of ultrasound imaging to minimize radiation exposure and reduce costs. 3-D ultrasound reconstructions provide accuracy comparable to that of CT. However, large inter-observer variability and long processing times preclude routine clinical use of 3-D image information. This research aims to develop software solutions for improved ultrasound-based AAA monitoring and other vascular diseases (in the long term). The tools used will be based on advanced image segmentation and registration algorithms involving curvature-driven image processing techniques and deformable models. The goal of the Phase I study is to establish feasibility of the proposed methods by demonstrating an improvement in the repeatability and accuracy of measurements and reduction in delineation time.         n/a",Vessel Segmentation/Registration from Ultrasound Images,6641019,R43HL069540,"['abdomen', ' aorta aneurysm', ' artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' gastrointestinal circulation disorder', ' gastrointestinal imaging /visualization', ' human data', ' mathematics', ' three dimensional imaging /topography']",NHLBI,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2003,99621,0.02052189876958128
"Ultrasonic Registration of Knee Anatomy to MRI Images  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will investigate the feasibility of using intra-operative ultrasound (US) images to noninvasively register the bone surfaces of the knee to preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images. A surgical navigation system, KneeNav, is being developed by CASurgica for intraoperatively planning the proper location of ligament attachment sites and drill tunnel locations and then guiding the surgeon to execute the plan. Despite agreement on the correct points of insertion, great variability exists in tunnel placement among surgeons and the rate of misplaced tunnels in ACL reconstruction surgery has been reported to be between 10-40 percent. Malpositioning of the bone tunnels is the main reason for revision surgery. The proposed research would increase the accuracy of the procedure versus current videoscopic techniques or versus competitive image guidance systems. The research plan is to establish a ""gold standard"" for registration accuracy using reconstructed CT scans, point-based surface matching algorithms, and optical tracking. Reconstructed MR models will be substituted for CT models and the accuracy reassessed. The US probe will then be calibrated and US surface collection will then be substituted for point based collection and the accuracy reassessed. Finally, registration of US directly to MR without reconstruction will be assessed.

"MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS Catheter ablation is a medical procedure that involves the destruction of        small volumes of heart tissue with radiofrequency energy.  To be                 successful, catheter ablation requires precise localization of the tissue        to be destroyed. To accomplish this in a typical ablation procedure, five        catheters containing a total of 19 electrode pairs are utilized to record        potentials (called electrograms) from spatially distinct locations within        the heart throughout the cardiac cycle. Experienced cardiologists                interpret the electrograms to locate the conduction pathways responsible         for the arrhythmia. The pathways are destroyed by applications of                radiofrequency energy, thus treating the arrhythmia.                                                                                                              Ablation procedures are performed by highly trained and experienced              cardiology sub-specialists yet the massive amount of data produced during        these procedures creates a data overload problem that can impede the             performance of even the best practitioners. This may be evidenced by (1)         overlooking important signal features, (2) misinterpreting the signals,          and (3) misinterpreting catheter locations in the heart, all of which may        lead to increased procedure duration and/or applications of radiofrequency       energy to the wrong part of the heart.                                                                                                                            The purpose of this project is to develop a model-based system for               interpreting intracardiac electrograms in near real-time. The system is          intended to assist physicians in ""making sense"" of the enormous amounts of       data recorded during a cardiac electrophysiology study. New computer             algorithms for reasoning about the time- and space-varying nature of             intracardiac electrograms from underlying causal models of the heart will        be developed. The models can be represented as a graph of nodes connected        by arcs. The nodes represent specific an atomic regions of the heart while       the arcs represent the connections between the regions.                                                                                                           The analytic approach will be a variation of the hypothesize-and-test            paradigm. The control loop will be based on the ""tracking"" concept whereby       models will be tracked as long as the data supports the model. Rule-based        knowledge will be utilized to generate models based on the observed data.        The output of the system will be a series of ladder diagrams describing          the data. In the event that the data admits more than a single explanatory       model, ladder diagrams will be generated for all created models.                                                                                                  This proposal is an extension of the applicant's graduate and post-              doctoral project, which used the same approach to the simpler domain of          the interpretation of the body-surface electrocardiogram. The domain of          this proposal is more complex because it adds reasoning with a more              detailed three dimensional cardiac model to the temporal reasoning               required for previous work. Also, this domain requires the ability to            account for simultaneous activation of the heart at multiple locations,          which was performed at a rudimentary level in the previous work.                                                                                                  This project is important for three reasons: (1) it offers new knowledge-        based algorithms for reasoning about time- and space-varying data, (2) a         comprehensive and extensible model of the cardiac conduction will be             created that incorporates the spatial resolution necessary for                   interpreting intracardiac electrograms, and (3) a software tool such the         one proposed may help clinicians improve the quality of health care.              n/a",MODEL BASED INTERPRETATION OF INTRACARDIAC ELECTROGRAMS,6126011,R29LM006004,"['arrhythmia', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' electrocardiography', ' heart catheterization', ' heart conduction system', ' human data', ' interactive multimedia', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development']",NLM,SOUTHWEST RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R29,2000,149839,0.04724220560753916
"Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Machine learning driven transthoracic echocardiographic analysis and screening for cardiac amyloidosis Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a serious but increasingly treatable cause of heart failure. Autopsy studies have estimated the prevalence of CA at approximately 25% of all octogenarians, and 15 to 20% of patients with aortic stenosis. Despite the increasing prevalence of CA within the general population and specific subpopulations, its diagnosis as a cause of heart failure is hampered by under recognition and subsequent underdiagnosis in clinical practice. Data suggest that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis is 2 years and that patients report seeing an average of 5 physicians prior to establishing a definitive diagnosis. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) testing is the most common initial evaluation because of its wide availability. A recent utilization review in the Medicare population indicated over 7 Million echocardiographic tests are performed each year accounting for $1.2 Billion in healthcare costs. TTEs provide comprehensive information about cardiac structure and function, yet complexity of interpretation has limited its screening performance in patients with CA, and diagnosis can be challenging. Thus, our group seeks to offer a computer vision and machine learning based TTE analysis and screening solution for CA. We are uniquely positioned for accelerated development with a cohort of 359 patients with confirmed CA and 4,862 controls. In Phase I, we will build a deep learning neural network-based image processing pipeline. It maps the TTE sequence into a 2-dimensional space that allows for the identification of the 4-chamber peak diastolic and peak systolic images within the cardiac heartbeat cycle. This will enable our screening model to recognize regional myocardial wall motion changes and hypertrophic patterns that characterize amyloidosis in comparison to controls with normal cardiac function. The operational point defining the performance characteristics of our screening-oriented model (including sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value) will be optimized using an average weighted accuracy (AWA) approach which accounts for CA disease prevalence along with a desired false positive and false negative tradeoff. If we are successful, we envision a Phase II proposal to build and deploy an automated TTE analysis tool, and to evaluate it in a multi- center clinical study. This sets the stage for our long-term goal to implement a computer assisted TTE screening solution to improve identification and by extension care of patients with cardiac amyloidosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE While non-invasive echocardiography is a first line tool for diagnosis for many cardiovascular symptoms, it is underutilized for less common diseases such as cardiac amyloidosis which recently has been shown to be increasingly prevalent in general and specific subpopulations. In this project, we will develop and validate a novel computer-assistive echocardiographic analysis tool to recognize the presence of cardiac amyloidosis.

"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,9739345,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,687210,0.060861971994445395
"Cardiac CT Deblooming PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 Americans annu- ally2. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive method widely employed for diagnosis of CAD and planning therapeutic interventions. With the current CT technology, calcium blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment. Similarly, stent blooming artifacts lead to overestimation of in-stent restenosis. As a result, many coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scans are non-diagnostic and result in patients receiving costly and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) procedures.  Based on extensive feasibility results, the goal of this project is to use deep learning innovations to fundamen- tally eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware. A consortium between GE Re- search, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Weill Cornell Medicine will develop dedicated imaging protocols and machine learning methods to avoid or minimize blooming artifacts and evaluate the clinical impact of the proposed solutions. In Aim 1, the CT scan protocol will be optimized and paired with deep learning reconstruc- tion and post-processing algorithms to generate high-resolution CT images and prevent blooming artifacts. In Aim 2, image-domain and raw-data-domain deep learning processing algorithms will be developed to correct for residual blooming. After successful demonstration of the proposed methods on phantom scans and emulated clinical datasets, in Aim 3 the proposed CT methods will be clinically demonstrated and optimized based on 100 patients with coronary artery disease, using intravascular ultrasound as the ground-truth reference.  At the end of the project, we will have demonstrated and publicly disseminated a systematic methodology to essentially remove blooming artifacts in cardiac CT without a costly hardware upgrade. This will be another suc- cess of deep learning, enabling accurate coronary stenosis assessment and eliminating many unnecessary diag- nostic catheterizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Blooming artifacts severely limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment with cardiac CT, leading to un- necessary invasive coronary angiography procedures. The goal of this project is to eliminate blooming artifacts without costly redesign of the CT hardware, but based on optimized scan protocols and deep-learning-based image reconstruction and post-processing techniques.

"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation. This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET in PET/MR and target delineation in radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from MR-only data.

"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Automated acute pulmonary embolism detection and staging from CT Project Summary / Abstract Minnesota HealthSolutions (MHS) proposes a Phase I project to develop and validate a software product capable of automatically detecting and staging pulmonary embolisms (PEs) using clinically routine pulmonary CT angiograms (CTAs). The proposed system will combine state-of-the-art machine learning methods and the clinical expertise of MEDNAX Radiology into a system that integrates seamlessly into the Radiology workflow and standard patient care path to improve the treatment decisions of physicians in the emergency department. Pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause of death in hospital patients with an estimated incidence of 1 per 1,000 patients. CTAs are routinely used to detect PE today; however, there is significant variability in the detection rate among radiologists using CTA. Furthermore, despite the strong evidence that the RV/LV ratio is an important clinical biomarker it is rarely measured quantitatively in practice. A successful completion of this project would provide a workflow-integrated tool capable of faster PE detection and more accurate staging of right heart strain to guide the physician’s treatment decision.

"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10052934,R01HL127661,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Selection Criteria', 'Speed', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'base', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2020,763531,0.09333528679865788
"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,9888240,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Country', 'Cox Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'International', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse event risk', 'attenuation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic', 'radiotracer', 'relating to nervous system', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,808131,0.05512324049943606
"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives. Project Narrative Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides which currently available solutions do not overcome.

"Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches Summary: There is an urgent need for an automated decision support system for diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). TBI is one of the leading causes of death in the modern world, and substantially contributes to disability and impairment. The early detection of TBI and its proper management presents an unfilled need. We therefore aim to supplement clinicians' decisions by developing a decision support system for monitoring and integrating available information of a TBI patient for accurate and quantitative diagnosis and prognosis. This project is the main component of a long-term goal of building a system that creates personalized treatment plans. Specifically, we intend to automatically detect and accurately quantify two critical abnormalities including shift in the brain's middle structure (Aim 1) and intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 2) from computed tomography (CT) head scans. In Aim 1, we develop a model for delineating the spatial shift in brain structure and its predictive power. We employ anatomical landmarks to detect a 3D deformed surface of the brain midline after TBI. Such an approach allows us to quantify the shifted volume, a measurement that is not currently achievable. Additionally, it provides accurate and timely access to conventional midline shift in a 2D CT slice. In Aim 2, we build a model for delineating intracranial hemorrhage and its predictive power. We implement a 3D convolutional neural network model to detect hemorrhagic regions and quantify and localize their volume. Currently, these measurements are inaccurate and not readily available due to the cumbersome manual process; instead a lesion's thickness in a 2D CT slice is used to assess its severity. In both Aim 1 and 2, we automatically calculate conventional and proposed volumetric and locational measurements and compare them to suggest the best diagnostic metric for each abnormality. Finally, in Aim 3, we build an automated pipeline for TBI severity assessment and outcome prediction. To this end, manual CT scan reads will be integrated with patient-level information available from electronic health records to achieve accurate data-driven diagnosis and prognosis. We implement machine learning approaches to build models capable of predicting short and long-term clinical outcomes. Our prediction models will be developed independently of our image processing algorithms. Upon achievement of Aims 1 and 2, automatically calculated information from CT scans will be incorporated into machine learning models. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance TBI care, specifically within the “golden hour"" post-injury. Ultimately, such a system has the potential to reduce delayed and missed diagnosis, thereby reducing TBI morbidity and mortality. Additionally, by preventing permanent and/or secondary injuries, and minimizing the time of hospitalization and rehabilitation, our system will contribute to reducing the annual $76 billion burden of TBI care in the U.S. In addition to innovation in the proposed approaches and their quantitative outputs, we aggregate four existing datasets to incorporate heterogeneity in both phenotypes and therapies, so the resulted model will be generalizable and applicable to real clinical settings. Project Narrative: Traumatic brain injury, frequently referred to as a silent epidemic, involves about 1.7 million people in the U.S, among whom 50,000 will die, while 152,000 will suffer from long-term disability and impairment. The proposed research will automatically diagnose and assess the severity of critical abnormalities from computed tomography head scan, and integrate all available sources of clinical data using data science methods to make a personalized data-driven prognosis. It is expected that this technology will provide caregivers with critical information for early and proper management of injuries, thus saving lives and improving the quality of life of survivors by reducing second/permanent injuries; importantly, this system would enable people living in outlying and deprived regions lacking skilled clinicians benefit from more accurate diagnostics, and as a result, a better care.",Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches,9989634,F31LM012946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'functional outcomes', 'human error', 'image processing', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2020,38064,0.0320314684285777
"Prognostic Markers of Emphysema Progression Project Summary/Abstract Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects up to 24 million people in the United States and is projected to be the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 with a total cost of $50 billion. COPD has been traditionally dichotomized into the clinical phenotypes of emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In particular, emphysema is defined as abnormal, permanent dilation of the distal airspaces. The development and progression of this pathologic process are associated with a decline in lung function and progressive clinical impairment. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the chest is increasingly being leveraged to quantify the disease and its progression objectively. Current approaches to quantify emphysema progression are limited and discard most of the spatial and temporal information in CT scans obtained at inspiration and expiration. In this proposal, we plan on developing computational components to prognosticate emphysema progression that builds upon image density markers and lung mechanical strain characteristics conditioned on their underlying emphysema subtypes. This proposal leverages our previous experience in computational emphysema subtyping to discover, validate and translate a novel panel of prognostic markers tailored around the postulated mechanisms of emphysema progression: inflammation injury and mechanical strain. To reach this goals, we will (1) develop an advanced emphysema subtyping approach using novel deep learning architectures, (2) develop a fast mass preserving large displacement registration approach to enable the discovery of local elastic properties of lung tissue between inspiratory and expiration CT scans, (3) discover new subtype-specific biomarker features based on image density relations and mechanical properties using unsupervised deep learning techniques within a common statistical framework, and (4) validate the prognostic value of the proposed biomarkers and their association with decline end-points and clinical outcomes to enable its clinical interpretation and translation. In addition to that, will be explored alternative prognostic models based on advanced machine learning techniques and performed a model comparison study to define the most prognostic model for emphysema progression. Our analysis will process 12,300 scans corresponding to 5,517 subjects with baseline and follow-up data from the COPDGene cohort –one of the largest cohort in COPD containing CT images at inspiration and expiration, respiratory and genetic measurements. The proposed methodology will provide reproducible, automatic and low-cost prognostic in-vivo biomarkers of emphysema progression that may enable the discovery of new therapies and translate them into clinical practice. Project Narrative Computed tomographic assessments of emphysema progression based on emphysema subtyping and lung mechanical strain biomarkers in the COPDGene study may provide insight into its prognostication. This may in turn lead to new therapies for patients with COPD.",Prognostic Markers of Emphysema Progression,9865706,R01HL149877,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alveolar wall', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Breathing', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Bronchitis', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complement', 'Connective Tissue', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Fracture', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Process', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Lung volume reduction surgery', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Smoker', 'Staging', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experience', 'expiration', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inclusion criteria', 'inflammatory marker', 'insight', 'mechanical properties', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'reduce symptoms', 'respiratory', 'response', 'response to injury', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue stress']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,730139,-0.018829231834689923
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",9936447,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'statistical learning', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,357486,0.07884029072108228
"Development of a prototype software for automated PET/CT interpretation and reporting in thoracic cancer Abstract. In cancer, body-wide FDG-PET/CT is a prime modality for diagnosis, staging, and treatment assessment. Despite its paramount importance to enable precision medicine in cancer, no method is currently available for automated disease burden estimation and standardized reporting on PET/CT images regionally and globally in anatomic organs and lymph node zones within a body region or body-wide. Automated production- mode body-wide/ body-region-wide disease measurement with standardized reporting will foster cancer research discovery and will be of great interest to oncologists, radiologists/ nuclear medicine physicians, Medicare and private health insurers, and pharmaceutical companies that conduct clinical trials of new cancer therapeutics and currently rely on manual methods of response assessment. The overarching goal of this Phase I project is, therefore, to develop, validate, and demonstrate a prototype software for disease measurement and reporting via FDG-PET/CT in the above manner in one body region, namely thorax, based on innovative algorithms that are generalizable body-wide. The project has two aims: Aim 1: Develop, implement, and validate algorithms for disease burden estimation in thoracic cancer via FDG-PET/CT. Aim 2: Develop and demonstrate a prototype software implementing the above algorithms for disease measurement and reporting. Aim 1 will be accomplished in 3 stages: Tasks 1, 2: PET/CT image data sets which are radiologically near normal for the thoracic body region will be gathered from existing whole-body scans of 100 patients. In these data sets, 7 key anatomic organs and 5 key lymph node zones in the thorax will be delineated under expert guidance. These data will be used to build population fuzzy anatomy models following our established Automatic Anatomy Recognition (AAR) methodology. An additional 100 whole-body PET/CT scans of patients with different types of cancer will be gathered to test our methods. Using available commercial clinical software, the PET uptake properties of lesions in organs and diseased lymph nodes in lymph node zones will be measured manually and used as reference ground truth of disease burden. Task 3: Deep learning (DL) algorithms anatomically guided by AAR will be developed to very accurately localize (but not delineate) organs and lymph node zones in PET/CT images using the models. Task 4: Novel methods based on fuzzy principles will be developed to automatically tag and quantify pathological regions (without explicitly delineating them) within located organs and nodal zones, and the accuracy of disease measurement will be evaluated (Task 5). Aim 2 will be accomplished by incorporating the disease measurement methodology into a prototype software named AAR-DQ (Tasks 6, 7) based on our earlier software platform CAVASS. AAR-DQ will report disease burden in a hierarchical manner – (i) at the body-region level; (ii) at each organ/ lymph node zone level; (ii) at each lesion/ lymph node level. Expected milestones. Aim 1: AAR-DQ disease measurement not to deviate more than 10% from clinical ground truth measurement. Aim 2: Disease measurement/ reporting in under 5 minutes per patient PET/CT study. Automated production-mode body-wide/ body-region-wide disease measurement has numerous potential applications in cancer and other diseases and has considerable commercial potential. The overarching goal of this Phase I STTR project is to develop, validate, and demonstrate a prototype software for disease measurement and reporting via FDG-PET/CT in the above manner in one body region, namely thorax, based on innovative algorithms that are generalizable body-wide.",Development of a prototype software for automated PET/CT interpretation and reporting in thoracic cancer,10076938,R41CA236492,"['Abbreviations', 'Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Body Burden', 'Body Regions', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chest', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Fostering', 'Geography', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thorax', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicare', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Nodal', 'Normalcy', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Privatization', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm training', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'evidence based guidelines', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lymph nodes', 'lymphoid organ', 'model building', 'novel', 'object recognition', 'outcome forecast', 'payment', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'response', 'software development', 'treatment response', 'uptake', 'whole body imaging']",NCI,"QUANTITATIVE RADIOLOGY SOLUTIONS, LLC",R41,2020,252131,0.04999612691319555
"Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH) is a leading cause of neonate mortality in the developing world, but there are limited resources in place for appropriately diagnosing and monitoring the infections that lead to hydrocephalus. There is often a lack of personnel and laboratory resources available for the gathering and processing of lumbar puncture and blood cultures, which are the gold-standard for diagnosing the infectious agents at play in sepsis and PIH. In order to overcome this obstacle, CSF and blood samples were taken from a cohort of septic neonates in Mbale, Uganda, as well as a cohort of neonates and infants who had already progressed to PIH. Cranial ultrasounds (CrUS) were taken from the cohort of septic neonates, and head CT scans were gathered from the PIH cohort. This proposal hypothesizes that the pathogens determined from RNA and DNA sequencing of the blood and CSF samples can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms to recognize imaging phenotypes characteristic of the underlying pathogen. Therefore, PIH can be prevented by providing pathogen-specific diagnosis and targeted treatment recommendations at the bedside for septic neonates using CrUS. Furthermore, surgical treatment success for PIH can be optimized using CT for the purpose of identifying the underlying pathogen and providing management plan recommendations. This project provides an ideal training environment for a fellow interested in pediatric neurosurgery with a research emphasis on engineering and machine learning applied to image analysis. The interdisciplinary and global nature of the project encourages development of a collaborative and innovative research approach. The home institution of Penn State provides multiple clinical opportunities for growth in pediatric neurosurgery, the MD/PhD program is supportive of truly translational research efforts, and the sponsor and co-sponsor are more than adequately prepared to provide all aspects of training mentorship necessary to accomplish the aims of this project and develop a well-rounded physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-infectious hydrocephalus is a devastating condition with a global impact, but diagnostic options and available treatment plans are limited in the developing world in particular. This project aims to design machine learning algorithms that leverage cranial ultrasound and head CT for the diagnosis of pathogen-specific sepsis and hydrocephalus in neonates, and propose treatment paradigms based on the diagnostic output.",Leveraging Neural Imaging for Automated Neonatal Infection Diagnosis,10066656,F30HD102120,"['Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Cauterize', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Coupled', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Management', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Endocrine', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Human Resources', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Microbiology', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Sepsis', 'Shunt Device', 'Spinal Puncture', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Survivors', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Uganda', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventriculostomy', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cerebrospinal fluid flow', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease classification', 'genome sequencing', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal sepsis', 'neonate', 'neurosurgery', 'non-invasive imaging', 'optimal treatments', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'septic', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,F30,2020,32183,0.02804452790911846
"Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is widely used to detect and evaluate coronary artery disease. The goal of this project is to reduce the radiation dose and/or scan time of SPECT MPI by a combined factor of 16x, while maintaining or increasing diagnostic accuracy. This would enable SPECT MPI to be performed, e.g., with 4x reduced radiation dose and 4x shorter scan time (~2.5 minutes) than typical protocols. Radiation dose in SPECT MPI has been recognized as an important issue, accounting for ~25% of all radiation exposure to patients in medical imaging. Dose reduction particularly addresses the increased prevalence of obese patients (who receive higher dose) and younger cardiac patients (whose radiation risk is higher due to longer life expectancy). Reduction in scan time would improve comfort for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating body-motion image artifacts and reducing healthcare costs by increasing clinical throughput. We will reduce dose and scan time through innovative image reconstruction methods that involve little or no cost and require no additional patient setup steps. We will employ new respiratory and cardiac motion compensation to reduce image artifacts, as well as new deep learning techniques, which will be used for both respiratory-signal estimation and high-performance denoising. We will methodically optimize these techniques and then validate our algorithms in multicenter clinical reader studies. SA1: Develop clinically practical respiratory motion surrogates for low-count studies. T1: Perfect data- driven respiratory surrogate estimation; T2: Optimize data-driven surrogate estimation at reduced counts; T3: Develop and clinically validate depth-sensing cameras for respiratory and body-motion surrogate estimation; T4: Generalization of data-driven surrogate estimation to SPECT systems not having a CT. SA2: Develop deep-learning reconstruction methods and optimize for diagnostic accuracy and dose/scan time. T1: Post-reconstruction DL denoising algorithms for 3D perfusion images for reduced-count and standard- count studies; T2: DL denoising algorithms for 4D cardiac-gated studies; T3: 4D reconstruction with embedded DL denoising, cardiac motion estimation and correction; and T4: DL reconstruction methods with both RMC and CMC, with projection data binned using respiratory surrogate signals derived in SA1. SA3: Perform multicenter clinical reader studies (6 clinicians, 3 institutions) to validate the new algorithms and compare to current clinically-available methods based on diagnostic performance and repeatability in assessing both perfusion and wall motion defects. T1: In comparison to baseline clinical reconstruction, evaluate added benefit of: a) including attenuation and scatter correction, and b) additionally including RMC; T2: Validate DL for improvement of perfusion and function (wall motion) task performance at full-count levels; and T3: Validate DL for improvement of task performance at reduced counts. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will employ new methods of image reconstruction and processing to reduce radiation dose and scan time in cardiac SPECT imaging, which is used 15-20 million times per year to evaluate coronary artery disease. Dose reduction is important because cardiac SPECT accounts for ~25% of all radiation exposure to the public due to medical imaging; reducing scan time would make SPECT more comfortable for elderly and infirm cardiac patients, while mitigating image artifacts, as well as and reducing healthcare costs by allowing more patients to be scanned per day. Our goal will be to achieve a combined 16x reduction in dose and scan time while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy, thereby permitting a 4x reduction in dose while reducing scan time from ~10 minutes to ~2.5 minutes.","Optimization of diagnostic accuracy, radiation dose, and patient throughput for cardiac SPECT via advanced and clinically practical cardiac-respiratory motion correction and deep learning",10072432,R01HL154687,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advocate', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Exposure to', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Institution', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Life Expectancy', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'heart motion', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'prognostic', 'quantum', 'radiation risk', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NHLBI,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,786840,0.07599860693972871
"Novel Quantitative Emphysema Subtypes in MESA and SPIROMICS Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema, jointly, are the fourth leading cause of death in the US and globally.

"Novel Non-Invasive Coronary Flow Patterning to Predict Early Coronary Microvascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Coronary microvascular disease (CMD) is notoriously difficult to diagnose non-invasively, and current methods of assessing CMD utilize only the peak velocity of the coronary flow pattern. While new imaging techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have improved the assessment coronary perfusion, there are currently no non-invasive methods that incorporate the coronary flow pattern over a complete cardiac cycle to definitively assess and predict the development of CMD.  Coronary blood flow (CBF) reflects the summation of flow in the coronary microcirculation, and our lab has begun to harness the full CBF pattern under varying flow and disease conditions (e.g. type 2 diabetes) to determine whether it might harbor novel clues leading to the early detection of CMD. Our past and preliminary data indicate an early onset of CMD in both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that occurs prior to the onset of macrovascular complications and that are characterized by blood flow impairments and alterations in coronary resistance microvessel (CRM) structure, function, and biomechanics. Our data also uncovered innovative correlations between CRM structure/biomechanics and our newly-defined features of the coronary flow pattern, some of which were unique to normal or diabetic mice. We have initially utilized these CBF features, in the presence and absence of other factors such as cardiac function, to develop a mathematical model in collaboration with Drs. Christopher Bartlett and William Ray that to date demonstrated that 6 simple factors can predict a normal vs. diabetic coronary flow pattern with 85% predictive accuracy. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, these preliminary data strongly suggest that the coronary flow pattern and physiological modulators of it (e.g. coronary micovascular structure/function/biomechanics, cardiac function, etc), may be useful in directly diagnosing early CMD. Therefore, we hypothesize that dissecting the elements that influence coronary flow patterning will be critical determinants in the direct assessment of coronary microvascular disease using computational modeling. Using our previous publications and our preliminary data as guides, the hypothesis will be tested by addressing two specific aims: 1) Determine whether unique time-dependent CBF patterning in normal and T2DM is dictated by a combination of CRM remodeling and biomechanics, coronary flow pattern dynamics, and cardiac function, permitting the development of a computational model to accurately predict CMD; 2) Determine the reproducibility and robustness of the machine learning model in predicting CMD in a diet-induced obesity/diabetes mouse model. If successful, these studies will be the first to simultaneously examine the influence of CRMs, CBF, and cardiac structure/function on the distinct pattern of coronary flow, and it will determine whether a mathematical model may be useful in establishing a direct assessment of CMD to eventually enable clinicians to conduct a more direct non-invasive diagnosis of CMD for the prevention and/or treatment of heart disease.

"Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. An estimated 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women die each year from CHD. Cardiac CT is a safe, accurate, non-invasive imaging modality used for diagnosing CHD and for planning therapeutic interventions. Cardiac CT exams are still challenging to perform due to the beating heart and the need to carefully time the scan based on cardiac phase and based on when the peak iodine contrast enhancement is reached. The overall exam duration and the complexity of performing these exams (contrasted with limited reimbursement levels) have limited patient access to cardiac CT to academic hospitals and specialized cardiac imaging centers. As compared to other CT exams, cardiac CT exams require additional patient preparation time, additional CT scans to track the bolus, and additional contrast agent to avoid missing the peak enhancement.  The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. Initial results show that it is possible to extract cardiac gating information from a few CT projection measurements prior to the diagnostic CT scan, without reconstruction. This is made possible by an innovative combination of fast X-ray tube pulsing and deep learning raw data analysis. This project builds on GE Research's experience with cardiac CT technologies, deep learning algorithms and X-ray tube physics, as well as the strong clinical cardiac CT expertise at the University of California San Diego.  The outcome of this project will be a clinical feasibility study of the autonomous triggering approach, which has the potential to simplify and increase patient access to cardiac CT, while reducing exam time, reducing con- trast agent volume, and ensuring robust image quality. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a smart cardiac CT scanner that autonomously determines the optimal scan time interval without ECG, traditional bolus tracking or timing bolus. The result will be a patient-friendly and technologist-friendly cardiac CT exam with reduced exam time, minimal contrast agent volume and radia- tion dose, and robust image quality.",Deviceless and Autonomous Prospective Cardiac CT Triggering,10029731,R01HL153250,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Bolus Infusion', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iodine', 'Measurement', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preparation', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'men', 'non-invasive imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'time interval']",NHLBI,GENERAL ELECTRIC GLOBAL RESEARCH CTR,R01,2020,1060608,0.18113160944682483
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,9886227,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), yet no large COPD study has ascertained cardiac function. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) COPD Study was funded to test the endothelial hypothesis of emphysema and examine reduced RV dimensions (“cor pulmonale parvus”) in COPD. In the MESA COPD Study II, we found that associations of reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow with emphysema do not appear to be confounded by hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and that emphysema on CT predicted RV regression over 5 years. We also developed methods to further subtype emphysema and COPD and scaled them up to the SubPopulations and InteRmediate Outcome Measures In COPD Study (SPIROMICS). We used unsupervised machine learning to discover new emphysema subtypes that are common and have molecular origins. Separately, we found that 26% of adults have segmental airway variants, which are associated with COPD and the developmental genes FGF10 and RARA. Both genes affect right heart development. In pilot work, we found one dramatically altered RV strain and the other associated with cor pulmonale parvus. Finally, we found that bronchitic ‘symptomatic smokers,’ who have hyperinflation from gas trapping, may have increased LV diastolic dysfunction. Hence, cardiac alterations in COPD are complex but recent advances in COPD subtyping may allow their personalized diagnosis and treatment. SPIROMICS is an NHLBI-funded prospective study that recruited smokers with COPD and controls and is re-examining 2,000 participants with gold- standard lung phenotyping including full-lung CT. We propose to add comprehensive echocardiography (echo) with speckle-tracking for cardiac mechanics for 1,000 SPIROMICS participants, with exercise in 700 and cardiopulmonary MRI in 600, to test the following hypotheses: 1) machine-learned subtypes of emphysema on CT are associated with specific alterations in cardiac structure and function, which vary from cor pulmonale to LV diastolic dysfunction; 2) participants with segmental airway variants have abnormal RV structure and function; 3) symptomatic smokers have signs of increased LV afterload and LV diastolic dysfunction. Innovative aspects of the application include the use of novel echo and MRI measures in a large, well- characterized cohort of COPD patients. Confirmation of the hypotheses would define the mechanisms of HFpEF in COPD and identify subsets of patients for targeted treatment of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. The death rate and hospitalizations from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have doubled in the last 50 years. A third of COPD hospitalizations overlap with heart failure, mostly with preserved ejection fraction. The proposed study would be the first large study with gold-standard phenotyping of the heart and lungs and would test highly specific hypothesized based upon recent advances in lung subphenotyping to yield personalized approaches to combined cardiopulmonary disease in COPD.",Combined Cardiopulmonary Failure in COPD: SPIROMICS HF,10020427,R01HL093081,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Apical', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Code', 'Complex', 'DRD1 gene', 'Death Rate', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diffuse', 'Dimensions', 'Drops', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Exercise', 'FGF10 gene', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Kinetics', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Pulmonary artery structure', 'RARA gene', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Sampling', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiogenesis', 'cohort', 'disorder control', 'disorder subtype', 'genetic variant', 'heart function', 'heart preservation', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'lung hypoxia', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient subsets', 'personalized approach', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'receptor', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'unsupervised learning', 'vasoconstriction']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,2331272,0.05256241087000262
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10019348,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2020,314388,0.11942729813124943
"Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred or fibrotic heart tissue plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive, multifaceted imaging modality and is the clinical gold standard for scar and fibrotic cardiac tissue imaging with use of gadolinium-based contrast injection. However, administration of such gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired kidney function? a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. Until recently, GBCA was presumed to be safe in patients with normal kidney function; however, there are emerging data on long-term GBCA retention in the body. We aim to develop two complimentary approaches to reduce GBCA use in myocardial, or cardiac muscle, scar imaging. Initially, we will develop a quantitative risk-benefit model to identify NICM patients with a low chance of having scarred myocardium. Concurrently, we will develop a GBCA-free cardiac MR myocardial tissue probe platform based on AI (MyoProbe.ai) to quantify scarred regions of the heart. To accomplish this, we will develop and evaluate an individualized, patient-specific scar prediction model to reduce GBCA use in NICM patients with different etiologies by training the model to learn to identify whether the patient is likely to have scarring based on non-contrast images. If it is unlikely that a patient has scarring, contrast administration can be avoided. To develop and evaluate MyoProbe.ai for GBCA-free quantification of myocardial scar in CHD patients, we will use AI to integrate signal intensity and heart motion data from MRI images to accurately locate and quantify scar tissue. This information can then be used by cardiologists to diagnose and treat the patient. We will rigorously validate our risk-benefit model and AI myocardial probe platform using retrospectively and prospectively collected cardiac MRI images from multiple healthcare centers, MRI vendors, and magnetic field strengths. Our dataset will include different types of NICM and CHD patient populations to ensure that our work is applicable to patients with many different types of NICM and CHD. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of scarred/fibrotic heart tissue with gadolinium- based contrast agents (GBCA) plays a major diagnostic and prognostic role in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). However, administration of GBCAs prolongs the scan time, increases scan cost, contaminates surface and drinking water, is retained in the body long-term, and is contra-indicated in patients with impaired renal function– a highly prevalent comorbidity in CHD patients. The goal of our study is to reduce or eliminate GBCA use in cardiac MR scar imaging using artificial intelligence (AI) by concurrently developing a quantitative model to identify NICM patients with a low likelihood of scarring and a GBCA-free cardiac MR AI platform to quantify scar tissue.",Gadolinium Free Cardiac MR Imaging of Scar and Fibrosis,10072898,R01HL154744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Fibrosis', 'Fostering', 'Gadolinium', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired Renal Function', 'Impairment', 'Injections', 'Ischemia', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Surface', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drinking water', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient safety', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'radiomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,946194,0.04213065110724222
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10006737,R44EB024438,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Location', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'radiation effect', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'voltage']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2020,820709,0.12265117173858016
"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,9877188,R21EB029179,"['Abdomen', 'Academia', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fruit', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'mortality', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'targeted imaging', 'urolithiasis']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2020,265345,0.13855912326302539
"Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cardiac CT provides fast non-invasive assessment of CAD with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value – provided that the lumen can be visualized. However, heavily calcified or stented coronary segments are non- assessable, precluding non-invasive diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary plaques in an estimated 2 million U.S. adults. In addition, the spatial resolution of state-of-the-art CT systems is insufficient for robust visualization of features associated with high risk plaques. Further, while CT can quantitatively evaluate the impact of obstructive CAD on myocardial function using dynamic perfusion imaging, this requires relatively high patient radiation doses, which has limited widespread adoption. Considering the high personal and societal cost of CAD, robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam is critically needed. Built by Siemens Healthcare, a first-of-its-kind, whole-body, photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT system was installed in 2014 at the Mayo Clinic. With support from NIH award EB016966, we showed that the increased iodine contrast-to-noise ratio, decreased electronic noise, spectral imaging capabilities, and improved spatial resolution of PCD-CT relative to commercial CT enabled us to accurately measure increased vasa vasorum density in injured swine carotid arterial walls, demonstrating the exceptional potential of PCD-CT in vascular imaging. Because this system lacks cardiac imaging capabilities, our objective is to develop and validate a PCD dual-source (DS) CT system and novel imaging algorithms to accurately assess CAD in humans, especially in patients with heavily calcified, stented, or high-risk plaques, and to identify patients with myocardial perfusion defects. Our premise is that the established benefits of PCD-CT, used with a DS geometry and advanced noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms, can meet these objectives. Our proposal is significant in many ways: the technology developments will benefit all of CT imaging; robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam will obviate the need for additional imaging, reducing the overall time and cost to comprehensively evaluate CAD and its clinical significance. To extend the demonstrated benefits of PCDs to cardiac CT will require numerous physics, engineering, and algorithm innovations, including novel noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms using energy, spatial and temporal domain redundancies, as well as deep learning. These advances will culminate in a large clinical study to demonstrate not merely that the images are “better,” as is so often done, but that PCD-DSCT provides clinically-significant improvements in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected CAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a new type of cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanner that is able to comprehensively assess coronary artery disease in humans. This technology, known as photon-counting- detector dual-source CT, is capable of exceptional spatial and temporal resolution, multi-energy spectral imaging and reduced radiation doses, allowing it to image the coronary artery and myocardium with unparalleled quality. This will enable comprehensive assessment of coronary artery anatomy and myocardial function from a single imaging exam, reducing time to diagnosis and cost, while also improving patient diagnosis and management.",Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management,9972330,R01EB028590,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Family suidae', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Iodine', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stents', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'calcification', 'clinically significant', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'photon-counting detector', 'routine practice', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'societal costs', 'spectral energy', 'spectrograph', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'vasa vasorum']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,628053,0.1107884704658992
"Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology using 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography Each year, 735,000 Americans have an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and approximately 120,000 die from it. Heart attacks occur most commonly due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries. Despite this, current diagnostic and treatment algorithms make no allowance for the assessment of disease activity and currently all patients with atherosclerosis are treated in a similar manner. This failure to differentiate stable from active disease may result in potentially unnecessary or insufficient therapies. In a breakthrough series of studies, our co-investigators discovered that positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-sodium- fluoride (18F-NaF; an inexpensive and widely available tracer approved by Food and Drug Administration) can readily identify plaque rupture and increased coronary plaque activity. We propose to build further on this success, by addressing several important remaining limitations that prevent us from translating this technology to broad clinical use. The limitations include complicated and subjective image analysis, underutilization of the concomitant coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) for plaque characterization, inability to utilize prior CTA for the analysis of 18F-NaF PET, lack of methods to integrate all available PET and CTA data and significant motion of the coronaries during the PET scan. We propose a multi-faceted approach to automate and improve coronary 18F-NaF PET imaging by full integration with CTA and correction for cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion. The overall goal of the proposal is to optimize the measurement of disease activity in coronary atherosclerosis using integrated 18F-NaF PET/CTA imaging, with the opportunity to validate this development against clinical outcome in a “real-world” multicenter patient study. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: 1) to integrate quantification of CTA and PET image data 2) to develop new methods for simultaneous correction of cardiac, respiratory, and patient motion for coronary PET, and 3) to clinically evaluate new methods in a multicenter clinical trial (separately funded and already underway), further refining risk prediction for heart attacks with integrated PET+CTA risk score derived by machine learning. This work will lead to a robust and reproducible clinical method for stratification of patients for risk of heart attacks, with potential to be applied for the identification of patients who would most benefit from expensive, and potentially risky treatments. Our techniques could also be used in future clinical trials to test the efficacy of novel therapies. Moreover, the new analysis will be applicable to other PET tracers that may be developed to investigate other pathological processes in the coronary vasculature. The resulting software will be shared with clinical institutions performing coronary PET to facilitate standardization and automation of this novel plaque imaging technique. NARRATIVE A heart attack, a major cause of death, is most commonly caused by rupture of deposits in heart vessels, leading to sudden blockage of the blood flow in the vessels and disruption of blood supply to the heart muscle. Currently there is no reliable test to identify deposits at the highest risk of rupture, but in a recent scientific breakthrough, positron emission tomography has demonstrated capability to image disease activity inside these deposits, linked to their rupture; this technique, however, is currently hampered by lack of anatomical reference, image blurring due to heart motion, and variability of manual analysis. We propose to address these problems by developing automatic software that precisely integrates anatomical and biological information and virtually “freezes” vessel motion, validating this new approach in a large “real-world” multicenter patient study.",Integrated analysis of coronary anatomy and biology with 18F-fluoride PET and CT angiography,10015326,R01HL135557,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Failure', 'Fluorides', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'automated analysis', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary plaque', 'coronary vasculature', 'cost', 'disorder risk', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'success', 'uptake', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,666434,0.04924601819505104
"STAN-CT: Standardization and Normalization of CT images for Lung Cancer Patients Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and one of the most common cancers among both men and women in the United States. Recent advances in high-resolution imaging set the stage for radiomics to become an active emerging field in cancer research. However, the promise of radiomics is limited by a lack of image standardization tools, because computed tomography (CT) images are often acquired using scanners from different vendors with customized acquisition parameters, posing a fundamental challenge to radiomic studies across sites. To overcome this challenge, especially for large-scale, multi-site radiomic studies, advanced algorithms are required to integrate, standardize, and normalize CT images from multiple sources. We propose to develop STAN-CT, a deep learning software package that can automatically standardize and normalize a large volume of diagnostic images to facilitate cross-site large-scale image feature extraction for lung cancer characterization and stratification. By precisely mitigating the differences in advanced radiomic features of CT images, STAN-CT will overcome research silos and promote medical image resource sharing, ultimately improving the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Our goal will be achieved through two Aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a working prototype to standardize CT images. First, we will collect raw image data from lung cancer patients and reconstruct CT images using multiple image reconstruction parameters, and we will scan a multipurpose chest phantom along with five different nodule inserts. Then, we will develop and train STAN-CT for CT image standardization. An alternative training architecture will be developed to achieve the improved model training stability. In Aim 2. We will deploy and test STAN-CT for image standardization locally and across three medical centers. First, we will make the STAN-CT software package available to the public by providing a menu-driven web-interface so that that users can conveniently convert medical images that were taken using non-standard protocols to one or multiple standards that they specify. Second, we will deploy STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky for local performance validation. We will test the functionality, reliability, and performance of STAN-CT using both patient chest CT image data collected at large-scale and the phantom image data, both independent to training. Third, we will deploy and test STAN-CT at the University of Kentucky as well as the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and Emory University for cross- center performance validation. We will use the same multipurpose chest phantom and both standard and non- standard protocols to validate STAN-CT at the three centers. We will test the generalizability of STAN-CT using clinical CT images of human patients and will determine whether a model trained using the data from one medical center are applicable for images collected at another place. Finally, we will distribute the software package of STAN-CT for public use. STAN-CT will enable a wide range of radiomic researches to identify diagnostic image features that strongly associated with lung cancer prognosis. Project Narrative Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most popular diagnostic image modalities routinely used for assessing anatomical tissue characteristics for disease management.

"Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection Project Summary Though cardiac transplantation is a lifesaving intervention, cardiac allograft rejection (CAR) remains a relatively common and serious complication that confers an increased risk of acute graft failure and adverse patient outcomes. For three decades, endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) with histological grading, as recommended by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) has been the broadly applied standard for CAR diagnosis. However, it is widely appreciated that the ISHLT rejection grading standard lacks diagnostic accuracy and has limited ability to discern the mechanism of rejection. These limitations expose patients to risks of both over-treatment and under-treatment, and highlight the unmet need for more accurate and informative approaches to histopathologic analysis of EMB samples. Our team is a leader in computational pathology image analysis with over 200 papers and >30 issued patents in this area. We have already developed and evaluated a computer assisted histopathology grading evaluation (CACHE) scheme which (1) in N=205 patients, had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.95 compared to two cardiac pathologists (mean AUC=0.74) in distinguishing normal from failing hearts and (2) could distinguish low and high ISHLT rejection grades in N=1109 patients with a performance that exceeds that of trained cardiac pathologists. Recognizing the frequent discordance between ISHLT rejection grade and the clinical trajectory of a rejection event, we will further develop and optimize CACHE to identify new “grade agnostic” morphologic biomarkers of clinically serious CAR. Our scientific premise is that morphologic biomarkers prioritized based on their correlation to patients’ clinical trajectories and underlying immunological disease mechanisms will generate an accurate, consistent and informative classifier for diagnosing allograft rejection. In service of this hypothesis, the proposed research will address three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize computational image analysis to discover the morphologic biomarkers of rejection-related injury which are needed to develop a classifier capable of assessing the clinical trajectory of CAR. In Aim 2, we will provide mechanistic annotation of biomarkers identified in Aim 1 through correlation with in-situ immunologic markers using custom multi-parameter immunofluorescence panels. In Aim 3, we employ a multicenter, prospective cohort to validate the diagnostic and mechanistic accuracy of the new rejection classifier developed in Aims 1 and 2. Ultimately, development of a more accurate and mechanistically informative tool for morphologic diagnosis of CAR will improve patient outcomes by reducing over- and under- treatment and inspire applications in other organ transplants. Interestingly, development of a superior histologic diagnostic tool will empower development of alternative, biopsy-free diagnostic approaches that have been handicapped by the necessity of comparison with the flawed ISHLT rejection grade as a reference standard. Project Narrative For heart transplant recipients, allograft rejection remains a relatively common and serious complication associated with adverse patient outcomes. Shortcomings of the current rejection grading standard for heart biopsies leads to both over- and under-treatment, accordingly, this proposal will develop and validate a computer assisted rejection grading classifier that is more accurate, consistent and informative for diagnosing heart allograft rejection. Improved diagnostic accuracy will improve patient outcomes, inspire similar applications in other organ transplants and empower development of additional technologies that have been constrained by the current flawed rejection standard.",Computer-Assisted Histologic Evaluation of Cardiac Allograft Rejection,10070406,R01HL151277,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allografting', 'Antibodies', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Graft Rejection', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart-Lung Transplantation', 'Histologic', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Injury', 'International', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Legal patent', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Recurrence', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker validation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'feature detection', 'graft failure', 'heart allograft', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic data', 'population based', 'post-transplant', 'prospective', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,845590,0.033934117085967705
"Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI Project Summary / Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million with a prevalence of 250,00-400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of HF is exercise (aerobic) therapy that has demonstrated various cardioprotective properties to halt and potentially reverse adverse structural remodeling. However, dosing of exercise therapy remains a challenge due to each individual's inherent differences and consequentially, serial non-invasive monitoring of the therapy would be necessary to evaluate the change on structural remodeling. Furthermore, current non-invasive technologies characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of exercise therapy in HF patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of exercise training to cardioprotect against HF by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with cardiac diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). DT-MRI is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current cardiac DT-MRI methods to be applied robustly in a clinical setting. In this project, an innovative 5-min “push button” DT-MRI method will be developed that overcomes such limitations. We also leverage institutional strengths to further quantify the accuracy of in vivo DT-MRI in revealing myocardial microstructure using novel tissue cleared 3D histology. The central hypothesis is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of cardiac DT-MRI to serve as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of HF on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted MRI. The proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-MRI methodology and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of exercise therapy on the microstructural remodeling of HF thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization of dosing exercise therapy. Project Narrative This project ultimately aims at optimizing the non-invasive monitoring of exercise therapy in heart failure patients to potentially improve outcome. The research strategy is designed to systematically develop an innovative cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that overcomes major shortcomings of the conventional methods and aims at immediate clinical translation. Successful completion of this project will result in a clinically robust cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that can effectively monitor the efficacy of exercise therapy and potentially improve treatment of heart failure.",Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI,9946164,R01HL151704,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Histology', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Pacemakers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'RNA marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Pathway', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Tachycardia', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'cardioprotection', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'denoising deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exercise training', 'functional loss', 'heart function', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'preservation', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'reconstruction', 'sedentary', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,673600,0.02727984885153916
"Cloud-based High-throughput Acquisition and Analytics of Zebrafish Electrocardiogram for Cardiac Studies and Drug Development Project Summary Sensoriis, Inc is a company that, develops evidence-based sensing solutions to support biological investigations and address health care problems. The goal of this NIH SBIR Phase II grant with University of California Irvine is to provide novel systems to assess cardiac electrophysiology in zebrafish models, supporting heart disease studies and drug screening. Heart disease plagues the world as the leading cause of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmic diseases alone contributed about 350,000 deaths annually in the U.S. Although causative genes for some of them have been partially discovered, genetic basis for the majority remains poorly understood. The zebrafish (Dario rerio) model system is an important vertebrate experimental model owing to its small size, low-cost for maintenance, short generation time, amenable and conserved genetics, and optical transparency. Zebrafish have long been used as model system for understanding human cardiac development, disease, and regeneration. Further, zebrafish model enables a forward genetic approach to reveal the genetic basis and underlying molecular mechanisms of numerous heart diseases. Owing to the physiological similarities to humans’, zebrafish have also proven to be an ideal model system for drug screening. The conventional setup for cardiac phenotype acquisition in zebrafish (i.e. electrocardiogram – ECG) involves anesthesia causing variation in functionality. To date, there is no system which can offer cardiac phenotype monitoring in freely-swimming zebrafish, not to mention for multiple fish simultaneously. Further, data processing and analysis have been done manually, making it impossible to conduct large-scale studies. In this context, we propose to establish a long-term roadmap using multidisciplinary approaches to enable i) novel devices and systems to provide reliable ECG data of multiple fish (both adult fish and larvae) over a long period of time; ii) cloud-based systems to effectively process and interpret as well as study large-scale data; and iii) a host of cardiac studies as well as drug investigations using the zebrafish models and our novel tools. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this Phase II SBIR grant, Sensoriis, Inc and the University of California Irvine will develop novel bioengineering tools to collect and study electrocardiogram of the zebrafish model with high throughput. The goal is to facilitate and reduce cost and time of cardiac phenotype-based acquisition and analytics in the zebrafish models, supporting numerous cardiac studies and drug screening applications.

"Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry Abstract Photon-counting CT (PCCT) is a major technological advance in CT imaging. Using photon-counting instead of current energy-integrating detectors, PCCT can offer superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, artifact reduction, and most notably, material decomposition. PCCT’s energy differentiation utility offers an ability to more precisely distinguish different materials and optimize and expand the use of contrast agents in CT. With these abilities, PCCT can significantly facilitate quantitative imaging, reduce radiation exposure, and enable revolutionary new applications in functional and physiological imaging beyond existing CT techniques. To realize the full potential of PCCT in clinical practice, the technology needs comprehensive assessments and application-based optimizations. Effective design and deployment of PCCT depends on many design and use choices that should be made in view of the eventual clinical utility. Making these choices requires large scale trials on actual patients. However, such trials are challenging, considering the need to make many decisions prior to prototyping, the limited numbers of prototype PCCT scanners available today, and the often-unknown ground-truth in the patient images. Even for existing prototype systems, many decisions require repetitive trials with multiple acquisitions. This is both unethical and impractical considering radiation safety concerns and costs. These challenges can be overcome by utilizing virtual imaging trials (VITs) using computerized patients and imaging models. VITs provide an efficient means with which to determine the most effective and optimized design and use of imaging technologies with complete control over the study design. In our prior funded project, we developed a VIT framework to evaluate standard energy-integrating detector CT technologies. In this project, we expand the applicability of this framework to photon-counting detector CT. Specifically, we enhance our computational XCAT phantoms to model the necessary higher-resolution detail including normal and abnormal tissue heterogeneities and intra-organ contrast perfusion diversity across populations (Aim 1). To image the phantoms, we develop the first PCCT simulator capable of mimicking existing and emerging prototypes (Aim 2). The enhanced VIT framework will provide the essential foundation with which to comprehensively evaluate and optimize PCCT technologies and applications. In Aim 3, we assess and optimize the use of PCCT for morphological, textural, and compositional quantification in select oncologic and cardiac applications, two leading health detriments in the US where PCCT can offer a notable impact. The results will be the first of their kind in comprehensively evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of PCCT, determining optimum dose per patient size for PCCT imaging of patients for cancerous lesions and cardiac plaque/stenoses, and helping to establish the effective utility of PCCT in clinical care. The purpose of this project is to develop and utilize a virtual framework to comprehensively evaluate and optimize emerging photon-counting devices and applications in CT imaging. The results will be the first of their kind evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of photon-counting CT and will help establish its effectual utility in oncologic and cardiac care.",Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry,10051026,R01EB001838,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Anatomy', 'Cancerous', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging technology', 'Industry', 'Lesion', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Specimen', 'Stenosis', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cardiac plaque', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'dosimetry', 'experimental study', 'human imaging', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'photon-counting detector', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual imaging']",NIBIB,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,545403,0.09143530347982408
"Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning ABSTRACT The accuracy of radiation treatment planning (RTP) heavily influences the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and multi-organ auto-segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will optimize multi-organ auto-segmentation based on MT-MR images. In Aim 3, we will assess the performance of MT-MR in the context of pancreatic cancer stereotactic body radiotherapy planning. Successful completion of the project will dramatically improve treatment precision and clinical outcomes, thus further promoting the adoption of radiotherapy in the management of abdominal cancers. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in many aspects of radiotherapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile. We will substantially improve the MR acquisition and multi-organ auto- segmentation, so the potential of MR as an imaging-based planning modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal radiation treatment.",Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning,10053211,R01EB029088,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Abdomen', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of abdomen', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Planning Techniques', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Study Subject', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Weight', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'segmentation algorithm', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,556712,0.013539618507360244
"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in stem-cell technology enable patient-derived cells to be turned into functional heart cells, and this is an exciting direction towards personalized medicine; yet, there are many challenges in optimizing these cardiomyocytes to better mimic the real heart – a problem that the proposed engineering tools will help resolve.",Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation,9839658,R01HL144157,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Data', 'Disease model', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'NADH', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'heart cell', 'heart metabolism', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanocarrier', 'optogenetics', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'stem cell technology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'voltage']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,706471,0.04144650080746094
"Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed study is motivated by the public health importance of aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of valvular heart disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Once symptomatic, survival is a dismal 50% at 1-year if left untreated. Clinical symptoms develop once cardiac compensatory mechanisms fail, indicating the need for aortic valve replacement (AVR), but because AS primarily affects the elderly, symptoms are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions, advanced age, or both—resulting in delayed treatment. While most patients that eventually undergo AVR experience improvements in symptoms and survival, nearly half of patients die within the first year after AVR or fail to reap the symptom and health status improvements for which they underwent AVR. Our research suggests that irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury related to delayed treatment contribute to these poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the unmet need for objective and sensitive measures to inform clinical decisions regarding the timing of AVR. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement an omics-based precision medicine approach for identifying patients with severe AS at-risk for irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury who would benefit from earlier AVR, and our central hypothesis is that multi-omic signatures reflective of dimensions of cardiac structure and function will identify irreversible cardiac remodeling and therefore predict the clinical response to AVR. Our prior work and preliminary studies provide strong support for our hypothesis and demonstrate that our experienced multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete the proposed study. We have identified metabolomic signatures that relate strongly to measures of cardiac function and structure and predict mortality after AVR, and also proteomic signatures relating to cardiac function that differentiate severe AS and associate with mortality. Within this proposal, we adopt a longitudinal systems biology approach that leverages the latest in proteomic and metabolomic (multi-omic) sciences to: discover, test, and cross-validate multi-omic signatures of cardiac function and structure in patients with severe AS (Aim 1); characterize longitudinal multi-omic signatures and associations with changes in cardiac structure and function after AVR (Aim 2); and evaluate the accuracy with which multi-omic signatures predict response to AVR (Aim 3). Our approach will enable us to identify multi-omic signatures of irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury in patients with severe AS. These data will support the development of new precision medicine-based strategies for identifying patients who would benefit from earlier clinical intervention in an effort to reduce mortality and maximize health after AVR. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aortic stenosis ultimately leads to heart failure and death, but valve replacement is curative. For many patients, valve replacement is performed too late, after damage to the heart muscle is no longer reversible, resulting in persistent symptoms and increased risk for death. The goal of my research is to identify compounds within the blood that can serve as an early warning that the heart is struggling to overcome aortic stenosis and can therefore help physicians plan the optimal timing of valve replacement surgery.",Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart,9946858,R01HL151838,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'EFRAC', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heart', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'aortic valve replacement', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'patient registry', 'persistent symptom', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive signature', 'pressure', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,696226,0.04837708665124552
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults. The relevance of the project to public health is reflected in the long-term goal, which is to construct a genetic risk profile which can be used by health-care providers and educators to identify individuals genetically at risk for chronic tinnitus.",Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,9824578,R21DC016704,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Audiology', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Hyperacusis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrial Arts', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Otitis Media', 'PTGS1 gene', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Tinnitus', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'college', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hearing impairment', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'relating to nervous system', 'serotonin receptor', 'serotonin transporter', 'sound', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'voltage gated channel', 'young adult']",NIDCD,NORTHERN ARIZONA UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,151994,0.016934281169643326
