"Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Modern digital pathology departments produce a tremendous amount of whole slide image data, which is quickly growing to petabyte scale. This plethora of data presents an unprecedented treasure chest for all kinds of medical machine learning tasks, including improvements in precision medicine.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of digital slides are not annotated on the image level, so histological points of interest are not integrated with the clinical notes or genetics associated with a patient. In contrast to other disciplines, manual labeling is not only cumbersome and time-consuming, but given the decades-long training of a pathologist, it is exorbitantly expensive and, due to clinical time constraints, impractical. Moreover, the time- dependent relationship between a patient's histology and genotype is not quantitatively leveraged to recommend combination therapies. Genetics informs us of important driver mutations, but how multiple cell types interact with these mutants over time in the tumor microenvironment to become histologically evident is less clear.  Deep learning synthesizes generations of pathologist knowledge as accurate quantitative models. Given a picture of a patient's morphology, I provide a tool that in four seconds finds the top ten most similar patients with their diagnoses, to support a pathologist's diagnosis decisions under the time pressures of active surgery. Recording the pathologist inspecting a slide at the microscope automatically annotates observed slide regions with time. Not only amenable for learning models that predict whether or not a region is salient to a pathologist making a diagnosis, this also allows all slides in a hospital to be annotated to identical criteria with only a representative sample of slides. I have submitted a manuscript reporting 85.15% accuracy in this saliency prediction task. This annotation greatly simplifies machine learning tasks, which can now focus on a non-redundant set of diagnostic regions in the slide, whether the application is to (a) find similar patients by morphology for diagnosis or (b) relate diagnostic morphology to the genetics.  Statistically modeling the relationship of the genotype to the histological phenotype in cancer opens promising new avenues in precision medicine. Taking a Big Data approach, I will leverage over 18,244 paired genome-histology samples to learn this model, using transfer learning techniques to maximize the value of all 18,244 samples for each tissue type. Genotype-phenotype model in hand, I will simulate the molecular clock in cancer, incrementally mutating the genome and predicting corresponding histology at each molecular time step. Through similar Q-learning that powers Google's champion artificial intelligence ``AlphaGo'', I will learn an agent that inhibits expression of a small set of mutant genes to maximize cancer progression-free survival time, by molecular time in the simulator. This not only measures the therapy's evolutionary durability, but also leads directly to experimentally testable hypotheses in 3D cell culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Digitized whole slide images of cancer tissue are a ``dark matter'' in the clinic, data that are often collected but rarely used quantitatively to model cancer or personalize medicine. I will, through close collaborations with practicing pathologists at globally leading cancer research hospitals, form statistical models of the histology evident in whole slides to (i) create clinical decision support tools that find similar patients by morphology alone to disambiguate cases that are difficult for a pathologist to diagnose under the time pressures of ongoing surgery, (ii) create a tool that learns which parts of a whole slide image are salient for a pathologist at the microscope to make a diagnosis, which greatly facilitates the deep learning techniques underlying [i] and [iii] by discarding redundant histological image data, and (iii) create a system that relates genotype to histological phenotype in cancer and learns an agent which leverages this system to determine the optimal multistage combination therapy to drive the histology towards health such that cancer progression-free survival time is maximized in the patient of interest. In this way, my statistical models will transform the vast dark matter of diagnosed histology data, representing generations of pathologist knowledge at these leading hospitals, into an indispensable resource for surgery, pathology, genetics, and precision medicine.","Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization.",9637337,F31CA214029,"['Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'CDH1 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Cells', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Drug Combinations', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'FGFR3 gene', 'Farming environment', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Medicine', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Second Opinions', 'Slide', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer imaging', 'cell type', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'improved', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular clock', 'molecular marker', 'mutant', 'overexpression', 'personalized medicine', 'petabyte', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'support tools', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F31,2019,45016,0.04318308903506035
"Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This UG3/UH3 proposal titled “Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance” is in response to Research Area 1 of PAR 16-349 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-16-349.html) specifically addressing the development of natural language processing (NLP) tools to facilitate automatic/unsupervised/minimally supervised extraction of specific discrete cancer-related data from various types of unstructured electronic medical records (EMRs) related to the activities of cancer registries. It is submitted through a multi-PI mechanism – Prof. Guergana Savova from Boston Children’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Dr. Jeremy Warner from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Prof. Harry Hochheiser from the University of Pittsburgh, and Prof. Eric Durbin from the Kentucky Cancer Registry/University of Kentucky. The current proposal builds on prior work funded by the NCI Informatics Tools for Cancer Research (ITCR) program (https://itcr.cancer.gov/ ). We envision building on our work to date to advance methods for information extraction of clinical phenotyping data needed to fuel a new cancer surveillance paradigm that would benefit hospital-based, state-based, and national cancer registries. In this new paradigm, surveillance programs would use the methods to enhance the speed, accuracy, and ease of cancer reporting. The proposed DeepPhe*CR platform could be deployed at local sites or centrally, and could eventually be integrated into existing or new visualization and abstraction tools as needed by the cancer surveillance community. Although there has been some previous work on automatic phenotype extraction from the various streams of data including the clinical narrative for specific types of cancer or individual variables for cancer surveillance, the proposed work will be a step towards a generalizable information extraction. This generalizability enables extensibility and scalability. Interoperability is reinforced through the modeling part of the proposed project which is grounded in most recent advances in biomedical ontologies, terminologies, community-adopted conventions and standards. Our planned partnership with three SEER cancer registries provides our decision-making processes with a solid foundation in large-scale cancer surveillance.

"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians. Quality medical care requires an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic errors lead to lower quality research and can lead to reduced quality of care and inappropriate treatment decisions that result in harm to patients. Our team will develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and will share these tools with cancer researchers and pathologists on a publicly available platform.",A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis,9781678,U01CA231782,"['Age', 'Atypia', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast biopsy', 'Carcinoma', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'E-learning', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Marketing', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Second Opinions', 'Slide', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'anticancer research', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer invasiveness', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'experience', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathology imaging', 'programs', 'research study', 'screening', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U01,2019,317390,-0.023181608080752248
"HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification ABSTRACT: Roughly 40% of the US population will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime. In a majority of these cases, a definitive cancer diagnosis is only possible via histopathologic confirmation using a tissue slide. Increasingly, these slides are being digitally scanned as high-resolution images for usage in both clinical and research digital pathology (DP) workflows. Our group has been pioneering the use of deep learning (DL), a form of machine learning, for segmentation, detection, and classification of various cancers using digital pathology images. DL learns features and their associated weighting from large datasets to maximally discriminate between user labeled data (e.g., cancer vs non-cancer, nuclei vs non-nuclei); a paradigm known as “learn from data”. Unfortunately, this paradigm makes DL especially sensitive to low quality slides, noise induced by small errors in the manual user labeling process, and general dataset heterogeneity. As many groups do not intentionally account for these problems, they learn that successful employment of DL technologies relies heavily on explicitly addressing challenges associated with (a) carefully curating high quality slides without preparation or scanning artifacts, (b) obtaining a large precise collection of annotations delineating objects of interest, and (c) selecting diverse datasets to ensure robust classifier performance when clinically deploying the model. To address these challenges we propose HistoTools, a suite of three modules or “Apps”: (1) HistoQC examines slides for artifacts and computes metrics associated with slide presentation characteristics (e.g., stain intensity, compression levels) helping to quantify ranges of acceptable characteristics for downstream algorithmic evaluation. (2) HistoAnno drastically improves the efficiency of annotation efforts using a combined active learning and deep learning approach to ensure experts focus only on regions which are important for classifier improvement. (3) HistoFinder aids in selecting suitable training and test cohorts to guarantee that various tissue level characteristics are well balanced, leading to increased reproducibility. Our team already has working prototypes of HistoQC (100% concordance with a pathologist, evaluated on n>1200 slides) and HistoAnno (30% efficiency improvement during annotation tasks). In this U01, we seek to further develop and evaluate HistoTools in the context of enhancing two companion diagnostic (CDx) assays being developed in our group. First, we will use HistoTools to quality control and annotate nuclei, tubules, and mitosis for improving our CDx classifier for predicting recurrence in breast cancers using a cohort of n>900 patients from completed trial ECOG 2197. Secondly, HistoTools will be employed for quality control and identification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer nuclei towards improving our CDx classifier for predicting response to immunotherapy in lung cancer using the n>700 patients from completed clinical trials Checkmate 017 and 057. These tools will build on our existing open source tool repository to aid in real-time feedback and dissemination throughout the ITCR and cancer research community. RELEVANCE: This project will result in development of HistoTools, a new digital pathology toolkit for common pre-experiment machine learning tasks in the oncology domain such as (a) timely identification of poor quality slides and slide regions, (b) quantitative metrics driving optimized cohort selection, and (c) generation of highly precise and relevant annotations. Each component is designed to directly combat an existing bottleneck in the evolving usage of digital pathology. HistoTools will significantly enhance the functionality of existing toolboxes and pipelines, facilitating increasingly sophisticated machine learning applications in oncology.","HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification",9734599,U01CA239055,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immunotherapy', 'International', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nivolumab', 'Noise', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer recurrence', 'cohort', 'combat', 'companion diagnostics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'experimental study', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning network', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,383459,0.021054604292226935
"NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration The Department of Energy (DOE)-National Cancer Institute (NCI) Collaboration was formed to jointly accelerate federal missions in precision oncology and computing through an alignment of needs and has been driven by three key national initiatives: the National Strategic Computing Initiative, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot. NCI has a critical need for increased computational capacity and sophisticated computational models to identify promising new treatments; deepen understanding of cancer biology; understand the impact of new diagnostics, treatments, and patient factors in cancer outcomes at the individual patient level; and to integrate pre-clinical model data for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.  DOE has a need for partnerships with user communities to broaden the functionality of next-generation high-performance computers and to advance the DOE mission in low dose radiation and systems biology for energy applications. The DOE-NCI Collaboration brings together the High Performance Computing (HPC) expertise and resources of the DOE with the NCI cancer biology and oncology knowledge base, infrastructure and data repositories to support accelerating capable exascale computing technologies and advance the frontiers of precision oncology, computational and data science, and advanced computing applied to cancer. Initial collaborations between the NCI and DOE were fueled by the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) 2015 executive order, which promotes a whole-of-government approach to bringing the unique national computing capabilities of lead agencies to transform broad deployment agency missions while meeting their own mission objectives. The DOE, a lead agency for NSCI, partnered with NCI, a broad deployment agency for NSCI, to develop exascale ready tools, algorithms, and capabilities to enhance precision medicine for cancer; this further aligns the DOE-NCI Collaboration initiated under NSCI with the Precision Medicine Initiative and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot.   Collaborative projects already underway between the DOE-NCI include the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) pilot projects, Exascale CANcer Distributed Learning Environment (CANDLE), and the Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine (ATOM) Consortium, a public-private partnership under the Cancer Moonshot aimed at changing drug discovery and design paradigms through the application of computational/in silico technologies.  The challenges within each JDACS4C pilot were used to shape the priorities for CANDLE, a DOE-supported Exascale Computing Project involving multiple HPC vendors, which addresses a shared need across the pilots to develop predictive models using large-scale data. Exploiting exascale technologies and capabilities anticipated for deep and machine learning, CANDLE will deliver an open source, collaboratively developed software platform providing deep learning methodologies to the community that will be used to advance precision oncology. In addition, it will establish a new paradigm for cancer research for years to come by making effective use of the ever-growing volumes and diversity of cancer-related data to build predictive models, provide better understanding of the biology underlying disease and, ultimately, provide guidance and support decisions on anticipated outcomes of treatment for individual patients. n/a",NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration,10047552,5N91019D00024,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contractor', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Goals', 'Government', 'High Performance Computing', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Radiobiology', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vendor', 'anticancer research', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'educational atmosphere', 'experience', 'frontier', 'high end computer', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel diagnostics', 'oncology', 'open source', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'public-private partnership', 'repository', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool']",NCI,"LEIDOS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, INC.",N01,2019,3250000,0.06742034662265196
"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,9634912,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data Methods', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'convolutional neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neural network', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,299899,0.011864930349052592
"PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Title: PRedictiOn algorithms for the deTECTion of early stage pancreatic cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Summary Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. A major reason for the lethal nature of this disease is the lack of effective strategies for early detection. As a result, the vast majority of cancers are detected at a very late stage. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer could be due to many reasons including, 1) lack of a clear quantitative or algorithm-based definition of a high-risk population who would benefit from active surveillance, 2) suboptimal use of image findings that could potentially foretell a growing tumor, 3) system or referral-related delay from time of abnormal finding to diagnosis and treatment. Methods to accelerate the detection of pancreatic cancer leading to increased proportion of early stage tumors at the time of diagnosis have the potential to have an immediate impact on survival. The objective of the proposed work is to establish a platform for development and implementation of a data-driven approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer within an integrated care setting. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on development of empiric algorithms for prediction of early stage pancreatic cancer as well as systematic pancreatic cancer-risk stratification of patients based on natural language processing-aided extraction of pancreatic features from existing pre-diagnostic imaging reports to enhance understanding of the natural history of disease progression. Finally, we will conduct a prospective cohort study to assess the accuracy of an algorithm-based approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Pancreatic cancer is most often diagnosed in a late, incurable stage. Population-based screening is not effective based on the relatively low incidence of this disease. The current study seeks to develop and apply an alternative approach to enhance our ability to identify patients with early stage pancreatic cancer through use of an electronic ‘trigger’ system based on information gathered from large electronic health systems.",PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT),9817364,R01CA230442,"['Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health Information System', 'Health system', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratory Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pancreas', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'demographics', 'disease natural history', 'electronic data', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk population', 'patient stratification', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tumor']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,674438,0.046694002412321065
"Combinatorial Biomarkers for Malignant Polyps and Colon Cancer Detection ABSTRACT Technological advancements in colonoscopic and polypectomy procedures have drastically reduced both the incidence and overall mortality due to colorectal cancer (CRC). However, even with the availability of multiple screening tools, only 40% of CRC are diagnosed at early stage, in part due to lack of compliance with follow-up colonoscopy procedure, limited access to colonoscopy. These factors contribute to inappropriate surveillance follow-up as well as development of `interval cancer' within 5-years of a completely negative colonoscopy. Histological characteristic of polypectized polyps (high-risk vs. low-risk) is among major criterion for follow-up surveillance colonoscopy. Given that current surveillance recommendations depend on the histologic type of the polyp, the underdiagnoses of these premalignant precursors often leads to inappropriate follow-up care and therapy, thus contributing to CRC. Our initial screening has identified that a combination of markers i.e. MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19-9 that accurately differentiate benign hyperplastic polyp (HP) from pre-malignant sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P) and tubular adenoma (TA). Based on preliminary studies and the identified gaps in diagnosis, we hypothesize that this newly identified marker panel of MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19.9 can accurately classify the major colorectal polyp subtypes, and in conjunction with machine learning tools can provide an economical product for improved patient stratification for better surveillance and prevention of CRC. To meet these milestones, two specific aims are proposed: aim 1 is designed to evaluate the potential of MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19.9 for effective stratification of benign from malignant polyps. The major milestones for this aim is the development of a MUC17, MUC5AC, and CA19.9 immunostaining kit and to evaluate the potential of the combination for differentiating HP, SSA/P and TA in highly suspicious cases with documented inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. Further, aim 2 focuses on the development of polyp differentiation deep learning computational program based upon histology, tissue markers (MUC17, MUC5AC and CA19.9), polyp size, number, and location (the most critical parameters for deciding the interval of surveillance colonoscopy) for accurate surveillance of CRC by colonoscopy. The major milestone is to develop and evaluate the colon cancer polyp stratification algorithm in an independent patient set. Overall, the present phase I SBIR application seeks to advance the CRC field by simplifying and improving CRC precursor classification, thus improving the ease of polyp classification which can facilitate better recommendations for follow-up surveillance colonoscopy. This should in turn further reduce the healthcare burden by improving patient adherence for CRC management, to reduce deaths from CRC. Altogether, results from Phase 1 will lead to validation in a multi-center trial and validation in a clinical setting (CLIA lab) during phase II to form the basis to seek FDA approval of this test for use in hospital testing to provide accurate classification of premalignant polyps. PROJECT NARRATIVE With only 40% of patient diagnosed at an early stage, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths. The present Phase 1 SBIR study aims to harness the diagnostic potential of a combination of biomarkers, clinical characteristic of polyps and CRC as well as machine learning approaches for accurate distinction of malignant polyp/tissues from benign for improving CRC detection and surveillance.",Combinatorial Biomarkers for Malignant Polyps and Colon Cancer Detection,9681054,R43CA235984,"['Adherence', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'CA-19-9 Antigen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Endoscopy', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'MUC5AC gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Mucins', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Polypectomy', 'Polyps', 'Portraits', 'Premalignant', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resected', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Serrated Adenoma', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Societies', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tubular Adenoma', 'Update', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer prevention', 'colon cancer screening', 'colonic crypt', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'combinatorial', 'compliance behavior', 'deep learning', 'design', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'glycosylation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'mortality', 'patient stratification', 'programs', 'prototype', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'surveillance strategy', 'tool']",NCI,SANGUINE DIAGNOSTICS AND THERAPEUTICS,R43,2019,225000,0.017127286436043065
"Functional Cancer Cell Maps FUNCTIONAL CANCER CELL MAPS SUMMARY I am currently an Academic Program Officer in Prof. Trey Ideker’s lab at UC San Diego. My title reflects the varied roles I play in the Ideker Lab, both scientifically and administratively, as I also serve as the Assistant Director of the Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI) and the San Diego Center for Systems Biology (SDCSB). I am involved in a wide range of research projects, both within the Ideker Lab and across the various Centers. Central though to many of these efforts is the role I play supervising a number of projects using the CRISPR/Cas9­based approach to map genetic interactions in cancer cells. These functional maps can be used to identify protein complexes and pathways in cancer cells and to reveal genetic dependencies that might be therapeutically tractable. These studies will also provide us with the necessary training data to build “visible” AIs, machine learning models that not only make accurate predictions but also provide mechanistic insights. FUNCTIONAL CANCER CELL MAPS NARRATIVE Many cancers in adults are caused by mutations acquired over time. Research in both the Ideker Lab and the Cancer Cell Map Initiative seek to understand how these mutations alter the function of proteins leading to cancer using a variety of biochemical, genetic and computational approaches.

"A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research Project Summary Cancer research is now a data-driven discipline, but only a minority of cancer researchers are data scientists. This severely restricts our ability to effectively study and cure the disease. The far reaching significance of our project is in federating disparate data and computational resources in order to provide a unifying analysis platform for computational cancer research.  We will extend the popular scientific workbench Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org) so that it can integrate with distributed data and compute resources used and needed by cancer researchers, including those resources in the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (NCR DC). Our Federated Galaxy system will allow users to seamlessly access NCR DC data across multiple resources. It will support multiple analysis scenarios tuned to skills and computational requirements of individual researchers.  The aims of this project are: Aim 1. Extend Galaxy for working with distributed cancer genomics and phenotypic data. This will enable Galaxy users to access both public and private cancer data regardless of their actual physical location. Best-practice approaches will be used for accessing restricted datasets.  Aim 2. Enhance Galaxy for context-aware, distributed cancer genomics analyses using shared workflow representations. This will enable Galaxy users to run genomics analyses on different clouds, ultimately reducing the time, cost, and data transfer associated with analyses.  Aim 3. Apply Federated Galaxy to precision oncology research. Workflows developed in this aim will leverage the technologies in Aims 1 and 2 to benchmark machine learning algorithms for predicting tumor phenotype and drug response. Interactive reports will summarize benchmarking results and utilize ITCR visualizations for deep dives into results.  Our system will provide a singular access point to distributed cancer datasets and will enable these data to be analyzed within a single portal in a way that satisfies multiple analysis scenarios and utilizes diverse computational resources. Finally, a cloud-centric Galaxy built for the NCR DC will substantially grow the community of users working with the GDC and the NCR DC. This is because Galaxy brings with itself a vibrant world-wide community of users and developers, which numbers tens of thousands of scientists. These individuals will help to tune the GDC and other resources within the NCR DC to the needs of real-life analysis scenarios and will enrich the set of tools accessible to cancer researchers. Project Narrative This project will develop a user-friendly scientific analysis workbench for analyzing cancer genomics data on the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons cloud platform. The workbench will democratize access to cloud-based cancer genomic analyses. It will also aid in precision cancer medicine by benchmarking and identifying the most accurate analytic methods for classifying tumors and predicting drug response.",A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research,9783755,U24CA231877,"['Awareness', 'Benchmarking', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Galaxy', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Minority', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'cancer genomics', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'computational platform', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data resource', 'design', 'distributed data', 'drug response prediction', 'empowered', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomics cloud', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'phenotypic data', 'precision oncology', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,752490,0.09226415509686671
"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, the outcomes of this project can potentially reduce screening time and costs, eliminate undue stress to patients, increase the coverage and accuracy of screening programs, and overall reduce colorectal cancer mortality.",Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records,9658032,R01LM012837,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Polyps', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive load', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'histopathological examination', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'translational impact', 'tv watching', 'whole slide imaging']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,356700,0.039965283694133276
"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9613818,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,188952,0.04765487375809762
"Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing. We will make our data, analysis methods and results readily available to a broad group of researchers within a cloud computing framework. NARRATIVE MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt) RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate levels of gene products, including proteins that are drug targets in cancer. In order to shift medical practice towards personalized treatments, the proposed research will apply innovative analysis methods to understand the role of miRNA expression on survival and drug response, within the context of DNA, RNA and protein data generated in a large research network. This will help identify cancer subtypes, and individual patient phenotypes, in which alterations in miRNA expression can lead to particular cancer progression pathways and treatment responses, in order to inform disease management.",Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics,9778767,U24CA210952,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Award', 'Biogenesis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Targeting', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Sequences', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Variant', 'analysis pipeline', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'flexibility', 'gene product', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor progression', 'working group']",NCI,PROVINCIAL HEALTH SERVICES AUTHORITY,U24,2019,386440,0.07327143489661185

"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data.

"Learning radiomic signatures to early predict response of rectal cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy Abstract Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common newly diagnosed cancer and the 3rd most common cause of cancer death among US men and women. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer. Preoperative CRT has clearly improved rates of local disease control and colostomy free survival; however the response to therapy is heterogeneous. It would be very useful to be able to predict the individual risk of each patient, so that their therapy can be personalized. The goal of our study is to derive clinically useful radiomic signatures from multimodal imaging data for the early prediction of treatment outcomes in rectal cancer patients. Central to our methodology are 1) an improved deep learning model for automatically segmenting tumors from multimodal imaging data with high accuracy; and 2) a multi-task deep learning model for robustly learning informative radiomic features to predict survival and recurrence. These methods will be used to derive individualized predictive indices of treatment outcomes based on a multimodal imaging dataset of rectal cancer patients who have received preoperative CRT. Our methods are generally applicable to radiomic studies of cancer patients. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader radiomics community. Project Narrative This project will develop multimodal imaging data analytic tools for the early prediction of treatment outcomes in rectal cancer patients who have received preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy.",Learning radiomic signatures to early predict response of rectal cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy,9619051,R21CA223358,"['Address', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colostomy Procedure', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Excision', 'Fascia', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Hemoglobin', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mesorectal', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nodal', 'Noise', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Rectal Cancer', 'Rectal Neoplasms', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Sphincter', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Total Mesorectal Excision', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'chemoradiation', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'disorder control', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'multimodal data', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'partial response', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'radiomics', 'rectal', 'response', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,169834,0.045909422967511875
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation. The research will establish  resources and software to contribute such methodologies for the Genome Data Analysis Network  projects that will subsequently be released into the public domain to benefit the entire scientific  community.",UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,9763504,U24CA210990,"['Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North Carolina', 'Oncogenic', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Subtype', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'data pipeline', 'exceptional responders', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2019,368332,0.03126278821829813
"Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bioconductor PROJECT SUMMARY  The Bioconductor project is rooted in recognition that efﬁcient, rigorous, and reproducible analysis of high- dimensional data can be achieved when statisticians, biologists, and computer scientists federate efforts in a transparent and carefully engineered way. The project Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bio- conductor devises new approaches to carrying out genome-scale analysis of cancer data using cloud computing environments. The proposal is based on strategies that have proven highly effective in ﬁfteen years of supporting collaborative and carefully engineered software for genome scale analysis in computational biology in the Biocon- ductor project, based on the highly portable and widely adopted R language and environment for data analysis. In Aim 1 we develop architecture and infrastructure for scalably harvesting cloud-based representations of large- scale cancer genome studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, creating formal high-performance workﬂows for processing and interpreting cancer genome analyses, and providing packaging and data distribution schemes for moving data to the cloud for scalable analysis there. In Aim 2 we create and support independent creation of intuitive and cancer-relevant interface components supporting reproducible interactive exploration and analysis using the facilities of Rstudio. In Aim 3 we update and generalize the Bioconductor MLInterfaces metapackage to support advanced machine learning using the cancer-oriented strategies and facilities devised in Aims 1 and 2. Our proposal will beneﬁt large numbers of cancer researchers who will be taking advantage of cloud resources, probably with R close to hand, by marrying strengths of cloud-centric strategies for data archiving and query resolution, to the strengths of Bioconductor development and analysis capabilities. We have letters of support from the leadership of the three NCI Cancer Cloud Pilot projects for this project. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite major advances in elucidating mechanisms of tumor initiation and proliferation, treatment strategies for many cancers are ineffective, and patient-to-patient variation in treatment response suggests that personal targeting of cancer based on tumor molecular proﬁles will be necessary. This proposal takes a design and architecture approach from a widely used project for analyzing general data arising in genome-scale biology, and adapts it to new NCI-supported cloud-based data archives and analysis environments. The proposal will accelerate identiﬁcation of sources of variation of tumor responsiveness to treatment and will aid physicians in devising personalized antitumor strategies.",Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bioconductor,9677124,U01CA214846,"['Acceleration', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Animal Cancer Model', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioconductor', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Harvest', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Leadership', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motivation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'analytical method', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer type', 'cloud based', 'computing resources', 'data archive', 'data format', 'data submission', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome analysis', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomics cloud', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'patient variability', 'portability', 'prototype', 'response', 'software development', 'spelling', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation', 'usability']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2019,425494,0.08727810257166625
"A Software Platform for the Identification of Cell Surface Antigens Using RNA-seq Data Human monoclonal antibodies are among the fastest growing therapeutic modalities, with over sixty compounds approved by FDA to treat infections, autoimmunity, chronic inflammation and cancer. In combination, these diseases are responsible for the deaths of 50 million people annually, according to the World Health Organization. However, the advent of therapeutic immunologics is expected to significantly reduce the associated morbidity and mortality, particularly for oncologic diseases. Currently, 15 immuno-oncologic (IO) treatments are commercially available and comprise a growing market that is expected to reach $100B by 2022. IO therapeutics effectively attack cancer by selectively binding tumor-specific protein domains on the cell surface, referred to as tumor-associated ectodomains (TAEs). However, many cancers remain insensitive to available IO as effective and safe TAEs are difficult to identify. Standard methods to detect TAEs are costly, time-consuming and limited in their ability to discover novel targets, necessitating the development of innovative technologies to circumvent this burden. RNAseq is currently the most effective method to discover novel splicing isoforms, is high-throughput, sensitive and inexpensive. Envisagenics has been at the forefront of RNAseq- based splicing characterization since the release of its SpliceCore® platform. Here, we propose to develop SpliceIO, a novel drug discovery platform that integrates the Envisagenics’ SpliceCore knowledge base with machine learning algorithms to enable rapid identification of aberrant splicing-derived TAEs using RNAseq data. In this Phase I SBIR proposal, we will develop and apply SpliceIO in the context of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, a cancer particularly resistant to IO but highly associated with splicing mis-regulation and mutations within key spliceosome components. We will identify and validate TAEs in vitro using established leukemia cell lines and patient-derived bone marrow aspirates in collaboration with Dr. Omar Abdel-Wahab from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Collectively, the aims outlined herein will allow us to both develop and validate a novel splicing-dependent TAE identification platform to provide new sources of drug targets while dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with their development. In addition, this will allow Envisagenics to create new partnership opportunities for IO co- development with pharmaceutical companies. If successful, this pipeline can be used to identify drug targets and/or biomarkers for patient stratification in cancer and inflammatory diseases in the context of an SBIR Phase II grant. Despite the recent success of immune-based treatments in melanoma, the majority of cancers remain insensitive and resistant to therapy, necessitating the development of approaches to rapidly identify novel drug targets. Here, we propose to build a target discovery platform that combines our proprietary database of RNA splicing mutations in cancers with machine learning to identify the most clinically-relevant targets for subsequent drug development.",A Software Platform for the Identification of Cell Surface Antigens Using RNA-seq Data,9909639,R43CA246950,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Antibodies', 'Aspirate substance', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line', 'Cell surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Chronic', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Grant', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense-Mediated Decay', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Databases', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Tumor-Derived', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'human monoclonal antibodies', 'immunogenic', 'innovative technologies', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'mortality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'response', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,"ENVISAGENICS, INC.",R43,2019,301502,0.01299437154486674
"Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer Abstract Head and neck cancers are the fifth most common cancer type in the United States, with an overall survival rate lower than 50%. Although the incidence of other sub-sites of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in past decades, the number of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) cases has increased significantly. Most OPSCC patients receive standard cancer therapy.4 However, the clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Predicting early in treatment whether a tumor is likely to respond to treatment is one of the most difficult yet important tasks in providing individualized cancer care.  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known driving oncogenic factor in oropharyngeal cancer, as well as a significant prognostic biomarker for patient survival. Retrospective studies conducted by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium (INHANCE) have demonstrated that clinical biomarkers have prognostic value in helping stratify OPSCC patients into groups with differing risks of death or disease progression. However, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients have similar rates of metastatic spread to HPV-negative patients. The same is true for patient groups stratified with other clinical biomarkers. More robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for optimally effective treatment.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Multiple studies indicate that miRNAs are promising cancer biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in oropharyngeal cancer. Imaging features extracted from medical images are an exciting new class of cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habitats. For several tumor sites, imaging biomarkers have shown promise in accurately separating favorable and unfavorable prognosis patients. However, current efforts to utilize high-dimensional multimodal biomarkers for treatment outcome prediction have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; feature redundancy, heterogeneity, and uncertainty; and patient cohorts with unbalanced outcomes. The correlation, independence, and complementary nature of multimodal biomarkers (imaging, miRNA, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers) remains unexplored as well.  The major goal of this research is to develop a multimodal biomarker-based model that can reliably predict subsets of OPSCC patients with low and high risks for treatment failure. The model will serve as a clinical decision-making tool. Specifically, we propose a novel principle and systematic machine learning-based strategy to effectively identify and seamlessly combine prognostic information carried by multimodal biomarkers. Aim 1: Identify prognostic multimodal biomarkers, given OPSCC patient data. Aim 2: Develop and test a comprehensive multimodal biomarker-based model for predicting OPSCC treatment outcomes. Aim 3: Assess the clinical benefit of the model for OPSCC patient stratification and individualized treatment. Narrative The achievement of this project forms a basis of combining non-invasive imaging biomarkers with miRNAs, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers for accurate cancer prognosis and discovering the correlation with genetic mechanisms leading to specific tumor phenotypes. This clinical decision-making tool can provide useful information to support patient stratification and individualized treatment. We anticipate that many of the methodological improvements established in this proposal will improve oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treatment and tumor response assessment and treatment in other disease sites as well.",Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer,9818602,R01CA233873,"['Achievement', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2019,419721,0.03793507801671046
"NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION ABSTRACT This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-CA-17-025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the few cancers with increasing incidence in the United States. Survival of patients with HCC is poor because most patients are diagnosed at late stages when treatment options are limited. HCC surveillance can detect cancers early and improve survival but it is inconsistently implemented. Not all liver nodules detected on surveillance imaging are malignant, these indeterminate nodules require follow up imaging to determine if they are HCC. This proposal assembles a team of specialists with complementary expertise in liver diseases, liver cancer, radiology, engineering, statistics, and information technology. The goals are to: (1) Improve HCC surveillance uptake in patients with cirrhosis by leveraging electronic medical records to remind healthcare providers and patients when they are due for screening tests; (2) Leverage analytic morphomics and machine learning to increase the detectability of HCC at an early stage; and (3) Increase detectability of HCC at an early stage using tagged HCC-specific peptides. We have worked closely together for many years and have participated/led many NIH funded clinical research networks. We have expertise and experience to carry out the proposed studies and will collaborate with other centers in the Liver Center Network to validate the methods/models we develop. We will also enroll patients with cirrhosis and collect data and specimens and provide access to existing well characterized data and specimen repositories that include both prevalent and incident HCC for Trans-Network studies. We are confident we will be able to contribute to this Liver Cancer Network and to early detection of HCC in multiple ways. SIGNIFICANCE Regular screening of patients with cirrhosis can diagnose liver cancer early and improve survival but it is inconsistently done. We assembled a team of experts with complementary expertise to increase liver cancer screening using electronic medical record system to send reminders to healthcare providers and patients. Additionally, we use two novel methods to improve our ability to differentiate malignant from benign liver nodules allowing liver cancer to be diagnosed earlier.",NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION,9784773,U01CA230669,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'GPC3 gene', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hepatitis C', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Organ', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'patient-level barriers', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'radiomics', 'repository', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'statistics', 'surveillance imaging', 'surveillance strategy', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,658591,0.03672117475838184
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,9609431,R01CA163336,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'TERT gene', 'Techniques', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'knowledge of results', 'melanoma', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'resistance mechanism', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2019,317385,0.04833769808865616
"A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer Project Summary We seek to develop robust platforms for capturing, enumerating and analyzing circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells from the blood of cancer patients. We will leverage our previously developed precisely engineered microfilter platform that allows effective separation and collection of viable CTC from patient blood. In parallel, we have developed novel imaging methods perfectly suited for rapid analyses for circulating tumor cells, clusters and associated cancer cell subtypes (such as Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, or CAF). We propose to integrate these two novel technologies to create a robust diagnostic tool for clinical pathology as well as basic research that enables capture, enumeration, and analyses of circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells. Our multidisciplinary team proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Build and validate the technology to rapidly acquire CTC/CAF images using Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy and evaluate the images with a deep learning algorithm  2) Evaluation of the integrated platform for using CTC/CAF in predicting recurrence/survival in early stage  breast cancer patients For these studies in early stage breast cancer, we have robust collaborations with industry partners in Circulogix Inc (Microfilter technology for cell capture), ClearBridge Inc. (FPM imaging of the microfilter surface), and Google Software (Deep learning algorithm for analyzing FPM images of microfilter). The ability to reliably and rapidly detect and analyze CTC and associated cancer cells in early stage breast cancer patients would deliver a major new tool for oncology research, a platform for screening of novel drugs, and a critical advance in precision cancer management. Project Narrative (Relevance) Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) and circulating Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (cCAF) are the agents of spread of cancer (metastasis), which is a direct cause of a large number of cancer-related deaths. Our interdisciplinary team of pathologists, engineers, cancer cell biologists, and microscopists along with industry partners will combine their novel technologies to, for the first time, establish robust capture, rapid identification and enumeration of CTC, cCAF and their clusters from whole blood of early stage breast cancer patients. If successful, our approach would enable researchers to better diagnose metastasis, predict risk of recurrence, and help clinicians to employ personalized therapy through treatment plans tailored to suit individual patients, hence resulting in a significant impact on human health.",A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer,9784775,U01CA233363,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Minnesota', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Whole Blood', 'analytical tool', 'arm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'expectation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'liquid biopsy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,560831,-0.05234480705465865
"Determinants of pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma phenotypes in CDKN2A hereditary kindreds This proposal addresses Provocative Question #2. We will use innovative approaches to investigate how CDKN2A (which encodes p16) mutation carriers develop different cancer phenotypes (pancreatic cancer vs melanoma vs no cancer), and include both genetic and non-genetic factors. We have identified 4 large, multi- generational kindreds with a founder CDKN2A deleterious mutation (L16R, 47T>G). Our preliminary observations demonstrate that this mutant has lower expression and decreased ability to regulate cell cycle progression compared to wild type protein. Our sequencing studies of kindred members with different cancer phenotypes have identified potential variants in novel genes that modify risk (LGR6, a co-receptor of Wnt signaling and COL11A1, which participates in oncogenic signaling, including TGFbeta). We will determine the ability of the p16 mutant to promote transformation and how it is influenced by interaction with the above candidate modifier genes, LGR6 or COL11A1, in pancreatic cancer and melanoma. We will also develop novel computational models using machine deep learning, to generate networks that capture high dimensional features to integrate gene, biology, and cancer phenotype. This approach will be extended to kindreds with other CDKN2A mutations. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify genotypes of potential modifier genes in multiple kindreds that feature pancreatic cancer and melanoma and known to carry CDKN2A germline mutations. We will use genome wide variant coverage of germline DNA from CDKN2A carriers from the 4 large L16R kindreds, plus additional members in 42 other similar CDKN2A kindreds. We will identify candidate modifier genes in the kindreds by rule-based statistical genetic analysis of genotypes. (2) Define the impact of CDKN2A L16R mutation on the function of p16 and its interplay with candidate modifier genes. We will elucidate the biological significance of mutations in CDKN2A and candidate modifier genes using functional and high throughput methodologies by analyzing the mechanism underlying the interplay between p16 and modifier genes; define new pathways cooperating with this interplay using a combination of genome wide studies to assess transformation in cells carrying p16 mutant or wild-type background using well established in vitro and in vivo models. (3) Develop a deep learning network model to integrate genetic, biological and epidemiological data to accurately infer pancreatic cancer and melanoma phenotypes and age of onset in mutation carriers. We will apply a convolutional neural network, a deep learning algorithm in the training dataset, develop a back-propagation algorithm to fine tune “weights,” and construct mutation-gene networks to capture high-dimensional features for each disease subclass. We will acquire and disseminate new knowledge and tools to the scientific community. Our integrated methods and approach will bring insight into how different cancer phenotypes can occur with identical predisposing mutations, which can be applied to other cancer syndromes with similar challenges.

"Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing Project Summary/Abstract Clinical data collection is accelerating rapidly, and in the future it will include both provider- and patient- generated data. Hidden within this mass of noisy observational data are clues as to factors influencing disease onset and outcome. Finding ways to exploit this trove of disease data can unlock a new perspective on disease processes. We can tackle disease both from the bottom-up, from experimental data generated in the laboratory, and from the top down, from clinical phenomena observed across human populations. A particularly impactful and prevalent disease is cancer. Each tumor harbors a unique combination of mutations driving a distinct set of oncogenic processes. Targeted therapies have been proposed to pinpoint these mutations, potentially requiring a vast array of therapeutic options. Cancer treatment often fails when drug resistance arises, another result of the complex combinatorial nature of tumor alterations. Combination therapies have been proposed as an approach to interfere with multiple disease signals simultaneously. However, identifying effective drug combinations, and the cancer types in which they are effective, is experimentally infeasible, leading to a push for computational solutions. In this proposal, we combine methods from social sciences and biostatistics to find the causal effect of a drug on cancer onset from observational clinical data. Both increased and decreased cancer rates in drug-takers are of equal interest, as they can inform us of disease processes and provide clinical impact. We are particularly interested in finding drug combinations that impact cancer. These combination effects are unlikely to have been detected, and our clinical data provides a unique resource for observing the effects of tens of thousands of drug combinations. We will pool the resulting causal drug effect estimates across the many cancers present in our data. To gain insight into the cellular processes underlying clinical effect, we will examine the impact of known cancer-causing drugs in vitro, using large public cell line assays. The accompanying goal is to provide Dr. Rachel Melamed with a career development experience to become an independent scientist. Her research will use observational health data to understand the genesis of cancer, prevent the disease, and discover new therapeutic options. This proposal takes advantage of the interdisciplinary strengths of the University of Chicago in computation, biostatistics, and medicine, as well as institutional resources in terms of data access and infrastructure. Dr. Melamed has assembled a team consisting of complementary mentors and collaborators with expertise in computation, statistics, translational medicine, personalized therapy, and cancer therapy. The career development plan focuses on enhancing her statistics and machine learning skills with structured coursework and mentorship, and gaining experience in biomedical applications via applied work and mentorship. This will provide Dr. Melamed with skills to model observational data and to integrate the results with experimental data. Project Narrative Clinical data has been shown to hold patterns relating drugs to cancer onset. Using this data to find drugs that increase cancer rates will provide insight into the disease and an opportunity for preventing some cancer cases. Discovery of drugs, and particularly drug combinations, that reduce cancer rates could suggest low-cost new therapeutic options.",Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing,9699483,K01ES028055,"['Adverse event', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Case Series', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Skill', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Premalignant', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career development', 'clinical effect', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data access', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder risk', 'econometrics', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'life history', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'training opportunity', 'translational medicine', 'tumor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2019,124953,0.05142677019488783
"Hardwiring Mechanism into Predicting Cancer Phenotypes by Computational Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Few biomarkers derived from genome scale data have translated into improved clinical classification of cancer subtypes, in spite of the wealth of available genome-wide studies and of the corresponding application of numerous statistical algorithms. This widespread shortcoming derives from the pervasive use of ""off the shelf"" algorithms and machine learning techniques developed for image classification and language processing, which are naïve of the underlying biology of the system. Furthermore, for genome-wide data, the number of samples is often small relative to the number of potential candidate biomarkers, resulting in variable accuracy on independent test data despite high accuracy in the samples used for discovery, which contributes to the failure of clinical biomarkers. This problem - so called ""curse of dimensionality"" - is further exacerbated by the prohibitive cost of dramatically increasing sample size and by patient stratification into smaller subgroups for personalized and precision medicine. Disease phenotypes arise from distinct and specific perturbations in selected networks and pathways defined by the interactions of their molecular constituents. In cancer, these perturbations may reside in gene regulatory networks topology and state, in cell signaling activity, or in metabolic conditions. We hypothesize that by leveragin such prior biological information on cancer biology we will be able to reduce model complexity and build mechanistically justified predictive models. To pursue this hypothesis, we will develop an analytical framework to embed mechanistic constraints derived from network biology into the statistical learning process itself. Hence, this application will develop a novel suite of statistial learning algorithms that embed (Aim 1) gene expression regulatory networks, (Aim 2) cell signaling activity, and (Aim 3) metabolism to classify breast and prostate cancer. Throughout the study we will work closely with clinical collaborators to ensure that our method improve over and above current predictive and prognostic models. Finally, since in our study we will also generate mechanistic classifiers based on gene expression measurements obtained from clinical assays that are already commercially available (i.e., MammaPrint®, and Decipher®), our innovative models and predictors will be also readily available for clinical translation. Our mechanism-driven classifiers will simultaneously have greater accuracy and interpretability than classifiers developed without regard for the underlying biology of the disease. Furthermore, embedding biological mechanisms in the classifiers will also facilitate the identification of alternative therapeutic targets specific to each cancer subtype, potentially improving patient prognosis and health outcomes. Finally, the substantial curation of molecular pathways and biological networks we will carry on in the project will also provide a powerful resource for futur studies, and the methodologies we will develop will be also applicable to other cancer and other human diseases, like neurodegenerative disorders, hearth disease, and diabetes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative This study will use mechanistic biological knowledge to implement a suite of statistical algorithms for cancer patient classification, which will also reveal the biological reasoning behind the classification decision rules. In the study we will also apply our novel methods to develop improved biomarkers for breast and prostate cancer patient clinical stratification, with the ultimate goal of facilitating the selection of appropriate treatment. To achieve this goal we will directly improve the existing commercial tests offered to the patients, with an immediate clinical impact, since our biomarkers will be directly implementable into these assays, with the potential to quickly reach the bedside.",Hardwiring Mechanism into Predicting Cancer Phenotypes by Computational Learning,9653969,R01CA200859,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Models', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker development', 'cancer cell', 'cancer classification', 'cancer subtypes', 'candidate marker', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'functional group', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized health care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,373431,0.020420584775503965
"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically. The functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist.",High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors,9647173,K22CA234406,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Base Excision Repairs', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'CRISPR screen', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Faculty', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Guide RNA', 'Heterogeneity', 'K22 Award', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of gastrointestinal tract', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenes', 'Oncologist', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Somatic Mutation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'colon cancer cell line', 'combinatorial', 'design', 'drug development', 'druggable target', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'homologous recombination', 'individual patient', 'irinotecan', 'learning strategy', 'loss of function', 'mouse model', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'oxaliplatin', 'precision oncology', 'predictive marker', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'targeted agent', 'targeted treatment', 'translational scientist', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,K22,2019,192240,0.035908780425744045

The Research Program will include an Implementation Studies Unit with an initial 2-year pilot study using adaptable technology to enhance shared decision-making in survivorship care planning for survivors of breast cancer. The Research Program also includes a Methods Unit with an initial innovation pilot study to test the feasibility of natural language processing to measure communication patterns pre-implementation and to monitor implementation fidelity of programs designed to enhance within-team and clinical team-to-patient electronic communication. The Research Program is expected to complete 8 to 10 pilot studies. In order to foster research aligned with iDAPT’s theme, we will build and sustain iDAPT’s Implementation Laboratory which incorporates capacity building and infrastructure for testing the use of technologies to support rapid cycle and real time deployment of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control. The laboratory includes primary care and oncology clinics in our local “Hubs” in southern Appalachia (North Carolina) and the northeast (Massachusetts) and “Spokes” including over 900 community-based oncology clinics in the NCIs National Community Oncology Research Program and nationwide Veteran’s Administration clinics. iDAPTs leadership is a multi-disciplinary team of experts with extensive experience in cancer-focused implementation science, behavioral science, computer engineering and computer science, clinical informatics, formative qualitative methods, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The iDAPT Developing Center will be considered successful if we achieve the following outcomes: (1) a robust, collaborative Implementation Laboratory with partners who are knowledgeable and experienced with implementation science in cancer control; (2) completion of 8 to 10 pilot projects related to iDAPTs emerging theme; (3) pilot grantees and lab partners are prepared to lead investigator initiated studies as a result of capacity building and pilot grant experiences; (4) junior faculty and underrepresented persons are engaged in all Center activities; (5) The field of implementation science in cancer control is advanced aligned within iDAPT’s emerging theme; and (6) iDAPT is part of a new network of ISCCCs who collectively build the field of implementation science in cancer control. PROJECT NARRATIVE iDAPT is a developing center that will use technologies to support rapid cycle and real time deployment and testing of implementation processes and adaptations within cancer control.

"(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy This proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specific genetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having great expertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system. We will study age effects on PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the host and the tumor focusing on melanoma with some bladder cancer work, two tumors that are highly responsive to αPD-1 and/or αPD-L1 as proofs-of-concept, and residing in distinct anatomic compartments. In Aim 1 we study tumor PD-L1 intrinsic effects on αPD-L1 and αPD-1 treatment in melanoma and bladder cancer using transplantable B16 and inducible Nras/Cdk2n melanoma models, and transplantable MB49 and BBN-induced tumors for bladder cancer studies. We also use novel melanoma and BC models with tumor cell- specific PD-L1KO. We study 3 cohorts of elderly versus younger humans getting αPD-L1 or αPD-1 for melanoma or bladder cancer for human validation. We measure high-dimensional cell phenotypes and signaling responses, proteins and genes to maximize the information collected from human samples and mice using 23-color FACS, CyTOF, Luminex, Nanostring and other approaches. In Aim 2 we use all the above models and analytic strategies in young and aged PD-L1KO mice and WT or bone marrow chimeras to test hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic (host) PD-L1 signals in treatment outcomes in melanoma and bladder cancer. In Aim 3 the Systems Immunology team will use their innovative and successful computational modeling to identify age- related co-predictors of immunotherapy response and to identify candidate mechanisms for responders and non- responders. We will define a trajectory of immune system aging in mice at ultra-high resolution by performing a systems level integrative analysis of aging in Collaborative Cross and BL6 mice tracked in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. This trajectory will be used to understand how tumor response and treatment outcomes vary as a function of age, and to build a simple, low parameter (i.e., easily testable and clinically translated), predictive models of treatment response. We will test insights by analyzing immune data from aged versus young patients undergoing αPD-L1 and αPD-1 cancer immunotherapy in novel machine learning approaches that we pioneered to identify insights from mouse data that are relevant to humans. Coupling this disease information with the healthy human aging trajectory that we recently defined will allow us to adapt our mouse data to predict optimal treatments in humans based on chronological and immune aging. This combined trans-disciplinary approach will identify common age-related disabilities that reduce PD-L1/PD-1 based immunotherapy responses and suggest tailored treatments for optimal efficacy that could later be tested in validation sets. These data can also be applied to other types of immunotherapy as we will also test. Cancer is a disease of the aged, but therapies are generally modeled in the young. We study age effects on cancer immunotherapy in response to PQ2 to develop ways to optimize cancer immunotherapy in aged patients most at risk. We focus on the PD-L1/PD-1 axis that is the cornerstone of the most successful cancer immunotherapies to date.",(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy,9788318,R01CA231325,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Appearance', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Genes', 'Genetically Modified Animals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Validation', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell dimension', 'cohort', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune function', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'nano-string', 'neoplasm immunotherapy', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'preclinical study', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'ultra high resolution']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2019,530090,-0.0005139040325077091
"Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research Project Summary / Abstract: Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75-80% of all cases. Tumor recurrence and progression are common among NMIBC patients: over 50% of patients have their tumors recur, most within the first year, and up to 45% of high-risk tumors progress to muscle-invasive disease within 5 years. Patients therefore undergo intensive clinical surveillance and treatment, contributing to bladder cancer being the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Large population-based studies have been limited in their ability to study tumor recurrence and progression because these key outcomes are not typically captured in cancer registry or other discretely coded data. To overcome this limitation and facilitate future epidemiologic and outcomes studies on NMIBC, we propose to develop and validate automated algorithms using natural language processing (NLP) to capture bladder cancer recurrence (Aim 1) and progression (Aim 2) from free-text pathology, urology, and imaging notes. We will externally validate the accuracy of the algorithms for extracting tumor characteristics using a national sample of 575 patients from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system (Aim 3). NLP is a powerful tool that works by segmenting notes into units of related text (e.g., sentences) and applying computational methods to determine meaning and extract data. We will use a novel, internally-developed NLP tool that integrates the best components of several open source NLP packages to efficiently develop, refine, and validate the proposed algorithms. Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) is an ideal study setting because of its large, diverse population, advanced electronic health record, high-quality cancer registry, and complete capture of care. The initial NLP algorithms will be created based on clinical input and chart reviews of a sample of medical records. The algorithms first will be developed using diagnostic reports, leveraging validated cancer registry data on 6,000 patients; the same clinical procedures are used for initial diagnosis as for recurrence / progression. Then, algorithms will be applied to surveillance reports and iteratively refined based on false positive and negative results vs. study chart reviews (n=100 for each iteration). The final algorithms will be compared to an expert reference standard provided by 2 urologic oncologists and a pathologist in a sample of 200 patients. Algorithm performance will be assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The final algorithms will be applied to 4,000 newly diagnosed NMIBC patients age >18 from 2008-2017 within KPSC. The frequency of recurrence and progression will be described, and characteristics of patients with and without the outcomes will be compared. Successful completion of study aims will produce novel, automated methods that will facilitate large epidemiologic and outcomes studies, whose results may improve care for NMIBC patients. Project Narrative Among non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients, the key outcomes are tumor recurrence and progression: treatment seeks to reduce recurrence and progression, and surveillance seeks to promptly identify these tumors for treatment. However, these key outcomes are not typically recorded in cancer registry or other discrete data, limiting the ability of large, population-based studies to study them. We therefore propose to develop novel, automated methods to identify bladder cancer recurrence and progression from pathology, urology, and imaging notes to facilitate large, population-based studies of bladder cancer.",Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research,9668002,R21CA227606,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'California', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Language', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'SEER Program', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Text', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Factor', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer recurrence', 'clinical care', 'data registry', 'discrete data', 'disorder control', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'frailty', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'systems research', 'tool', 'treatment trial', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'urologic']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2019,172270,0.051295947524608775
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9720681,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,161230,0.08319136063746524
"Development of a pipeline tool to predict immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes PROJECT SUMMARY  Epitope-based cancer immunotherapies have been intensely investigated for decades, but have thus far met with mixed results in the clinical setting. Recent years have, however, witnessed a resurgence of interest based on advances in high-throughput sequencing approaches that allow rapid identification of cancer- associated, patient-specific mutations having the potential of being recognized as epitopes (neo-epitopes).  Previous studies defined binding affinity associated with immunogenicity for HLA class I MHC restricted CTL responses of viral and non-self origin. However, it is not clear if the same threshold is applicable to identify epitopes in self-antigens, such as the ones recognized in autoimmunity and cancer. Additional factors expected to play a crucial role in the immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes include the propensity of epitopes to be derived by natural processing, and subsequent capacity of being recognized by TCR. While several online tools are available for predicting processing and TCR recognition, the relative role of each of these factors (HLA binding, processing, TCR recognition) has not been analyzed in the cancer setting. Likewise, how the different online tools can be optimally combined to predict neo-epitopes has not been thoroughly addressed.  Accordingly, our study will experimentally establish the threshold for HLA binding affinity of neo- epitopes, validate the suitability of HLA binding prediction methods in a cancer setting, and establish whether predicted binding affinities can be suitably used in lieu of experimentally measured binding constants. We will also evaluate the predictive value of additional variables globally affecting neo-epitope immunogenicity, including allele-specific HLA binding thresholds, HLA-peptide binding stability, binding capacity of the somatic sequence from which a neo-epitope is derived, the predictive capacity of TAP and proteosomal cleavage algorithms and, to account for neo-epitope TCR interface effects, we will evaluate two alternative schemes based on analysis of the residue type occupying putative TCR contact positions. Finally, we will explore combining all neo-epitope immunogenicity predictors into a single pipeline and provide experimental validation of its predictive efficacy.  The proposed research will provide 1) the first in-depth characterization of the relative importance of different variables affecting neo-epitope immunogenicity, 2) the first integration of predictive tools for each of these variables into a single pipeline, and 3) freely available online access of a newly developed pipeline to the scientific community. This is highly innovative, since no such resource is currently available for epitope immunogenicity in general, and for cancer neo-epitopes in particular. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is intended to provide in-depth characterization of the importance of several variables affecting cancer neo-epitope immunogenicity. These findings in turn will allow the development of bioinformatic tools, and a unified analysis pipeline, towards the identification of cancer neo-epitopes. Identification of such epitopes is expected to allow quick identification of cancer-associated, patient-specific, mutations potentially recognized as epitopes, with direct applicability to the development of efficacious therapeutics.",Development of a pipeline tool to predict immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes,9703890,R21AI134127,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigens', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Literature', 'MHC Class I Genes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Scheme', 'Side', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Therapeutic', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Weight', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'experimental study', 'immune activation', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neoantigens', 'peripheral tolerance', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R21,2019,225000,0.05803648368112555
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9621372,K00CA212457,"['Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'inter-individual variation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2019,83070,0.021082781120625484
"Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing Project Summary Tissue stiffness varies along organs and tissue types, from very soft (e.g. brain) to intermediate (e.g. digestive organs) and to very stiff (e.g. bone). Sensing this stiffness by cells determines differentiation, proliferation, migration and survival, which are all important for development. Local tissue stiffening is a hallmark of cancer, sensing of which by cancer cells causes further tumor progression and metastasis. Understanding stiffness sensing mechanism is thus essential for designing appropriate treatment strategy against developmental disorders and cancer. The prominent “sensor” for mechanical stiffness of tissue environment is a molecular complex located between the cell and the environment, referred to as a focal adhesion. The first step in stiffness sensing is thought to involve transmission of increased level of a force across molecules in the focal adhesion against higher tissue stiffness, but the underlying biomechanical/molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The challenge in investigating this mechanism is in the dynamic nature of its structure, molecular interaction and mechanical forces affecting its assembly. The goal of this work is to understand whether, how and when the focal adhesion during dynamic assembly from their birth starts to be able to transmit the differential forces against varying tissue stiffness levels. Toward this goal, we have developed a set of experimental, microscopic and computational techniques to measure a small force from the adhesions, to profile heterogeneous dynamics of entire adhesion population, and to link molecular activity to force transmission in statistically confident manner. Specifically, we focus on a tiny dot-like complex called “a nascent adhesion”, an early form of the focal adhesion, and involvement of the mechanical linker protein talin, given its ability to be stretched and expose binding sites for other molecules like a vinculin, another mechanical linker protein. The overall objective of this proposal is to use these techniques to test a novel conceptual model of stiffness sensing in which nascent adhesions are sensitive to the tissue stiffness by talin-mediated transmission of force, which promotes further maturation of them to focal adhesions. We will determine if 1) nascent adhesions can transmits differential levels of force in response to varying ECM stiffness, 2) the main source of force actin cytoskeleton- driven and myosin-independent, 3) there is concurrent recruitment of talin and vinculin as a pre-assembled complex and whether it affects force-transmission in response to the ECM stiffness, and 4) competition for talin binding of talin-binding proteins against actin-binding decreases force transmission by nascent adhesion and impair the ECM stiffness sensing. An enhanced mechanistic understanding of these processes would increase our fundamental knowledge of how cells sense and respond to tissue mechanics. Thus, the proposed studies are relevant to the NIH's mission, as they will lead to new insights in physiology and pathophysiology including tissue development, regeneration and cancer progression. Project Narrative Cells’ ability to sense tissue stiffness has a fundamental impact on tissue development and disease progression such as cancer metastasis. The sensing takes place at the interface between the cells and the extracellular matrix via integrin-based adhesions, but our understanding has been limited to sensing by big, mature adhesions. This proposal seeks to test whether tiny, newly-born adhesions can sense tissue stiffness by accurate measurement of mechanical force transmitted through them and recruitment of early adhesion proteins.",Nascent Adhesion-Based Mechano-transmission for Extracellular Matrix Stiffness Sensing,9880640,R15GM135806,"['Actins', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomechanics', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chimera organism', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'F-Actin', 'Fluorescence', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Integrin Binding', 'Integrins', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Movement', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Organ', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Talin', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Traction\xa0Force Microscopy', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vinculin', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer cell', 'cellular engineering', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'mechanical force', 'migration', 'novel', 'particle', 'polymerization', 'recruit', 'response', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins', 'sensor', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor progression', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,414802,0.004286751818794268
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,9663912,U54CA225088,"['Achievement', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAF gene', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Newsletter', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'acquired drug resistance', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical research site', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'effector T cell', 'imaging modality', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2019,2067796,0.02248266142003714
"Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Title: Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Abstract Cancer is a complex disease in which genetic disruptions in cell signaling networks are known to play a significant role. A major aim of cancer systems biology is to build models that can predict the impact of these genetic disruptions to guide therapeutic interventions (i.e. personalized medicine). A prominent driver of cancer cell growth is signaling pathway deregulation from mutations in key regulatory nodes and loss/gain in gene copy number (CNV). However, current mathematical modeling approaches do not adequately capture the impact of these genetic changes. Reasons for this include the poorly understood layers of regulation between gene expression and protein activity, and limitations in most modeling and protein measurement technologies. In addition, there is a paucity of overarching hypotheses that can link specific gene expression or mutation patterns to the cancer phenotype. Recent work by our group has resolved some of the technical challenges that have hindered the application of proteomics technologies to cancer systems biology research. It has also suggested a new approach for using quantitative proteomics data to understand mechanisms driving cancer cell behavior. Using an ultrasensitive, targeted proteomics platform that can measure both abundance and phosphorylation of proteins present at only hundreds of copies per cell, we found that signaling pathways appeared to be controlled by only a limited number of key nodes whose activity is tightly regulated through low abundance and feedback phosphorylation. We propose to build on these findings by critically testing the hypothesis that CNV and genetic mutations dysregulate signaling pathways in cancer by shifting control from tightly regulated nodes to poorly regulated ones. This will be done by systematically identifying key regulatory nodes of normal and cancer cells using CRISPRa/i screens, determine the relationship between protein abundance and signaling pathway activities using ultrasensitive targeted proteomics and phosphoproteomics and then use these data to semi-automatically generate mathematical models of the functional topology of the signaling pathways. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Use targeted CRISPR gene perturbation libraries to identify the regulatory topologies of signaling pathways important in cancer and how they are disrupted by common cancer mutations, 2) Use the CRISPR perturbation and proteomics data to semi-automatically build predictive models of cancer cell signaling pathways, and 3) Combine modeling and perturbation screens to understand how feedback regulation in cancer contributes to drug resistance. This work will result in simplified, computationally tractable yet mechanistic models of signaling pathways and provide network maps of feedback and crosstalk circuits that can be used to rapidly map the regulatory state of cells. Most important, it will provide a generic platform for translating protein abundance and phosphorylation patterns into a “state” snapshot of cancers that can lead to predicting their response to specific drugs. Narrative Cancer is an extremely complex disease which is frequently caused by signaling pathway deregulation from genetic mutation or loss/gain in gene copy number. Modern analytical techniques have provided a wealth of data on the molecular changes associated with cancer mutations, but it has been extremely difficult to use this information to design targeted therapies. We propose a new methodology that combines CRISPR-based targeted screens, advanced proteomics technologies, and a new mathematical modeling approach for identifying proteomics signatures of altered signaling pathways in cancer that can be used to build predictive models and explore mechanisms of drug resistance.",Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer,9731187,U01CA227544,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'CRISPR library', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Feedback', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Play', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'cell behavior', 'design', 'experimental study', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2019,608348,0.06327501294288689
"Low-Cost and Compact Multimodal Intraoral Confocal Probe for Oral Cancer Detection and Diagnosis Abstract Oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) together rank as the sixth most common cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 400,000 new cases each year. The 5-year survival rate in the U.S. for OSCC is 62%, the survival rate is only 10-40% and the cure rate around 30% in the developing world. Low survival rate is primarily attributed to the delay in diagnosis and the resultant progression of disease to an advanced stage at diagnosis. Early diagnosis offers the best chance to improved treatment outcomes and survival for an individual diagnosed with OSCC. The objective of this proposed project focuses on developing and evaluating a low-cost, compact, smartphone compatible multimodal intraoral confocal probe for noninvasive in situ detection of oral dysplasia and early stage cancer. The key innovation of the proposed intraoral confocal probe is low-cost and compact confocal intraoral probe using actively addressable point source array - microLED (µLED) without any moving parts to achieve 3D confocal imaging. The wide-FOV autofluorescence imaging (AFI) and polarized white light imaging (pWLI) will identify the suspicious regions with the help of trained neural network and guide confocal scan to obtain tissue microstructure for accurate diagnosis. We will achieve this objective through the following two Aims: (1) develop multimodal confocal imaging probe with µLED array and (2) evaluate the performance and clinical feasibility of multimodal intraoral probe. The proposed project has a great significance. The compact, multimodal handheld intraoral imaging probe, in conjunction with the deep learning image classification method, will enable noninvasive in situ early detection and diagnosis of oral dysplasia and cancer from benign conditions in a clinical setting, significantly reducing disease progression, reducing death rates from oral cancer and improving the quality of life. The cost-effective, smartphone compatible design is extremely suitable for screening oral cancer through remote diagnosis in low- resource setting, significantly improve the survive rate of oral cancers in low- and middle- income countries. Early detection of oral cancer is the effective method for improving both the survival rate and the quality of the lives of the patients. We propose to develop and validate a low-cost, compact, smartphone compatible multimodal intraoral confocal probe for noninvasive in situ detection of oral dysplasia and early stage cancer in clinical settings.",Low-Cost and Compact Multimodal Intraoral Confocal Probe for Oral Cancer Detection and Diagnosis,9825049,R21DE028734,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Benign', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Complex', 'Death Rate', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Equine mule', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mouth Neoplasms', 'Neoplasms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Oral Diagnosis', 'Oral cavity', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Site', 'Source', 'Southeastern Asia', 'Specificity', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stage at Diagnosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'accurate diagnosis', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer prevention', 'confocal imaging', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'design', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intraoral probe', 'low and middle-income countries', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'oral dysplasia', 'oral lesion', 'oral tissue', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sensor', 'software development', 'tongue root', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2019,223982,0.02041066243207493
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9765042,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,530736,0.06555928280115578
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community.

"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. The influence of daily rhythms on cancer biology and treatment is particularly strong.

"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The integration of a machine-learning algorithm will further provide precise and unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor ecosystem.",Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems,9756346,U01CA214411,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomimetics', 'Biopsy', 'Bioreactors', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cetuximab', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glucose', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidics', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Rest', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Derived', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'cytokine', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fluid flow', 'genetic profiling', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'protein B', 'response', 'side effect', 'survival outcome', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2019,775492,0.018611687541540634
"Statistical framework for assessing drug sensitivity in vitro and linking patient outcomes Project Summary Pharmacogenomic studies offer insight into how genomic markers correlate with drug response and hold potential for developing effective personalized cancer treatment regimes. Cell viability dose-response curves are often summarized by the area-over-the-curve (AOC) and used to determine which cells are sensitive to a given treatment, thereby discovering markers of response. However, uncertainty surrounds pharmacogenomic findings for several reasons: 1) A lower-than-expected level of agreement between any two pharmacogenomic studies when comparing similarly-assayed cell lines and drugs, 2) how inter-study correlation is measured, 3) the sensitivity measure reported and subsequent threshold used to call sensitive versus resistant cell lines, and 4) how the in vitro models recapitulate in vivo patient outcomes. For the F-phase I develop a statistical model to address the first three of these issues and apply the model to cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) datasets to show that agreement is improved by conditioning on the posterior probability that a given drug is targeted and selecting the appropriate correlation metric for the underlying distribution of the data. I quantify uncertainty in calling sensitive versus resistant cell lines and report measures of inter-study agreement between other publicly-available pharmacogenomic datasets for common drugs and cell lines. I next provide findings from a collaborative effort assaying patient-derived organoids lines for individuals diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I use my model to assess AOC and show through exploratory data analysis why the measure needs to be adjusted for growth rate confounding. I identify issues resulting from samples with low growth rates and motivate an empirical Bayes growth rate estimator. I show how the estimated growth rates compare with the other measures of sensitivity to illustrate the validity of the approach. I assess patient outcomes data with the organoid assays and report associations with patient time on treatment to motivate my second aim and the primary research direction for the K-phase of the fellowship. I show low correlations between the in vitro drug sensitivity measures and the in vivo patient sensitivity proxy measure. Given the low correlations I describe alternative measures of patient sensitivity and detail the first direction for my post-doctorate research. To that end I describe a deep learning model I am developing which takes as input clinical reports data and outputs cancer progression/response predictions. I use these labels to train a deep classifier which takes as input unstructured clinical notes and outputs a prediction of cancer progression along with an associated estimate of uncertainty. The input text is transformed into a vector embedding using word2vec and uncertainty is quantified via Bayes-by-backprop. Upon successful model training I will investigate using the predicted labels and uncertainty estimates to link to the pharmacogenomic in vitro sensitivity models to assess agreement between the models and patient outcomes. Project Narrative Pharmacogenomic studies offer insight into how genomic markers correlate with drug response and hold potential for developing effective personalized cancer treatment regimens, yet uncertainties surround their findings for several reasons. I develop a statistical modeling framework to quantify the posterior probability of sensitivity, study agreement, and associated uncertainty, then apply the model to pancreatic cancer-derived organoid lines. I illustrate confounding with cell growth rate, develop a shrinkage estimator for growth-rate normalized sensitivity measures, and lastly present associations between in vitro pharmacogenomic models and in vivo patient outcomes to motivate the need for both in vitro experiments and in silico methods which accurately recapitulate patient outcomes.",Statistical framework for assessing drug sensitivity in vitro and linking patient outcomes,9879060,F99CA245736,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Correlation Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Drug Targeting', 'Encyclopedias', 'Fellowship', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Organoids', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phase', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Probability', 'Proxy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'base', 'cell growth', 'conditioning', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'drug sensitivity', 'experimental study', 'genomic biomarker', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'off-label use', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'predicting response', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'statistics', 'treatment response', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,F99,2019,32423,0.018992950820619102
"Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers PROJECT SUMMARY As a computational biologist, my long-term goal is to develop methods and tools to discover new or better therapeutics for cancers. In the past few years, I have identified drug-repositioning candidates for a number of primary cancers using Big Data approaches. These candidates have been validated successfully in preclinical mouse models. To maximize the utility of Big Data, I plan to translate the findings into therapeutics; therefore, I propose to develop methods to utilize transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers. Current preclinical and clinical approaches including the NCI MATCH trial select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations, yet patients may have no actionable mutations or multiple actionable mutations that are hard to prioritize, suggesting the need for other different types of molecular biomarkers. The recent efforts have enabled the large-scale identification of various types of molecular biomarkers through correlating drug sensitivity with molecular profiles of pre-treatment cancer cell lines. Computational methods to match these biomarkers to individual patients to inform therapy in the clinic are thus in high demand. The objective of this award is therefore to develop computational approaches to identify therapeutics for individual patients by leveraging large-scale biomarkers identified from cancer cell lines. Through conducing this research, I expect to expand my knowledge in cancer clinical trials, cancer genomics, cancer biology, and statistics. To achieve the goal, I have gathered seven renowned experts from different fields related to Big Data Science as mentors/advisors/collaborators: Primary Mentor Dr. Atul Butte in translational bioinformatics from UCSF, Co-mentor Dr. Samuel So in cancer biology from Stanford University, Co-mentor Dr. Mark Segal in statistics from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Andrei Goga in cancer biology from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Laura Esserman in breast cancer trials from UCSF, Collaborator Dr. John Gordan in liver cancer trials from UCSF and Collaborator Dr. Xin Chen in cancer biology from UCSF. With the support from my world- class mentors, advisors and collaborators, this award will prepare me to be a leader in developing big data methods that are broadly impactful. PROJECT NARRATIVE One goal of the precision medicine initiative is to select optimal therapies for individual cancer patients based on their molecular and clinical profiles. Current preclinical and clinical approaches select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations. This work is expected to employ the protein/gene expression based biomarkers computed from public databases to inform individualized cancer therapy.","Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers",9741127,K01ES028047,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Award', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Non-Malignant', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'data sharing', 'drug candidate', 'drug efficacy', 'drug sensitivity', 'efficacy testing', 'genetic signature', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'protein expression', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,170187,0.05114630385058626
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,9754585,U24CA189523,"['Algorithmic Software', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Activities', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrialization', 'Infiltration', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'computational suite', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular subtypes', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2019,578546,-0.03805413748487734
"The Mechanism of SOX6 in Ewing Sarcoma Metastasis Project Summary Current survival rates of pediatric cancers like leukemia have seen drastic positive response in survival and treatment in the last 20 years. In stark contrast, patients with solid tumor metastasis challenge the current paradigm of intense chemotherapy treatment. Such treatments have failed to change the poor prognosis of metastatic disease indicating a need to understand the complex underpinnings of the in vivo metastatic microenvironment. This need for understanding is enhanced in pediatric patients, where metastasis is promoted by access to a large pool of undifferentiated cells. This project addresses this critical issue in Ewing sarcoma, a cancer that codifies the challenges and shortcomings of current cancer therapeutics. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant cancer of bone and soft tissue targeting children, adolescents and young adults. Overall survival rates for Ewing sarcoma patients with metastasis is abysmal at less than 20% for those with advanced disease and at 60% for those with localized tumors. One in three patients with Ewing sarcoma will have presentation of metastasis. These metrics demonstrate the desperate need to further understand the genesis of metastasis in vivo. This proposal focuses in on the role of the transcription factor SOX6 and its role in Ewing sarcoma metastasis. My preliminary zebrafish xenograft data show a clear, marked increase in metastasis with normal levels of SOX6, while SOX6 shRNA knockdown cells have less or no metastatic spread from injection site. My SOX6 knockdown proteome data show suppression of CAV1, a known gene targeting E-cadherin expression in Ewing sarcoma and increase of BCL2A1, an established anti-apoptotic protein involved in numerous cancer cells. This project’s central hypothesis is: 1) SOX6 mediated protein changes cause an increase in motility and decrease in apoptosis leading to metastasis and 2) that upon metastasis, interaction with the microenvironmental niche triggers invasive proliferative phenotypes mediated by downstream targets of SOX6. These SOX6-mdediated phenotype and proteomic changes support a story of in vivo initiation and persistence of metastatic lesions in Ewing sarcoma. This proposal is the first to look at the intersection of the cell microenvironment with SOX6 to show a new pathway for advancing momentum to targeted treatment of metastasis. Using my unique background in engineering and my training in cell biology, I propose a method that remediates key failures of current treatment by understanding the initiation of metastasis in vivo, persistence of cancer cells, and microenvironmental effects fostering metastasis. This proposal unites many disciplines to offer scientific impact on the genesis of metastasis and provides an incredible opportunity to train my skills as a future independent investigator. Project Narrative: Many metastatic models of cancer fail to account for the complexity of the tumor microenvironment at the metastatic niche, and the zebrafish provides a readily imageable model to analyze human cancer metastasis using machine learning. This project looks at the in vivo role of the transcription factor SOX6 in metastatic progression of Ewing sarcoma through cell proliferation, motility change, and apoptosis suppression. Further understanding and characterization of SOX6 will provide a new pathway for understanding metastatic progression, commonly associated with poor prognosis, in human Ewing sarcoma patients.",The Mechanism of SOX6 in Ewing Sarcoma Metastasis,9833891,F31CA236410,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biosensor', 'Bone Tissue', 'CAV1 gene', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Child', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collagen', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-Cadherin', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Failure', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Injections', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Bone Neoplasm', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'SOX6 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Zebrafish', 'advanced disease', 'cancer cell', 'cell motility', 'chemotherapy', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'leukemia', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'response', 'skills', 'small hairpin RNA', 'soft tissue', 'targeted imaging', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2019,33510,0.043421748708261834
"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9840425,R01CA234557,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow', 'COL1A2 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cancer Patient', 'Castration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Indolent', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'androgen sensitive', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'cell stroma', 'clinically significant', 'conditioning', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome editing', 'host neoplasm interaction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intercellular communication', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'molecular oncology', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'oncology', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer metastasis', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'response', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,496626,-0.04515956140254918
"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,9613231,R01CA214428,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'CLIA certified', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Designer Drugs', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Economics', 'Feedback', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Observational Study', 'Oregon', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer genomics', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'genomic profiles', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'user-friendly']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,588045,0.03255898047693833
"The UCLA Center in Early Detection of Liver Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of death in cirrhotic patients. This neoplasm is associated with liver cirrhosis in more than 90% of cases. A method of detecting HCC accurately in its early stages would greatly improve our ability to manage and treat the disease. The UCLA Center aims to develop an effective and affordable blood-based method for the early detection of liver cancer. Our team consists of translational and clinical researchers with multi-disciplinary expertise in the areas of early detection, biomarkers, cancer surveillance, imaging, and biorepositories. We will focus on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood. ctDNA carryies cancer-specific genetic and epigenetic aberrations, which enable a noninvasive `liquid biopsy' for cancer diagnosis. Our diagnostic test is based on the DNA methylation patterns of cfDNA. Our integrated computational and experimental technologies can significantly boost the diagnostic power while dramatically reducing the cost. We have the following aims: (1) We will establish a longitudinal cohort of cirrhotic patients. The cirrhotic patients will be subject to ultrasound imaging screening and blood sample collection every 6 months. The UCLA liver clinic sees ~1200 cirrhotic patients per year. (2) We will establish a state-of-the-art biospecimen repository that includes plasma from individuals in the cohort, tissue from liver tumors after resection, and cirrhotic lesions after liver transplantation.

"Precision Medicine by Targeting Cell Adhesion in Melanoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the proposed research, we address a problem that is common not just to melanoma, but also to other forms of cancer, such as prostate cancer, and that has been widely discussed recently. While we as dermatologists encourage patients to undergo skin cancer screening exams to detect melanoma early, it remains challenging to differentiate the truly aggressive from the indolent or nonclinical pigmented lesions. This is true even after a melanoma has been biopsied and examined under the microscope. As a result, there is massive over-diagnosis and overtreatment, specifically with respect to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies, that is costly, has side effects, requires precious hospital infrastructure and induces substantial patient anxiety. Surprisingly, and despite decades of research on cancer, assessment of metastasis risk in primary cutaneous melanoma continues to be based primarily on tumor invasion depth (also referred to Breslow depth), a method that was introduced 45 years go. While Breslow depth tends to work well at the extreme ends of the spectrum, most melanomas fall into a grey zone where Breslow depth with or without additional tissue-derived and clinical variables (such as patient age) does not predict the true biology of melanoma well. Breslow depth continues to be popular because alternative methods, including molecular-based methods, are either ineffective, have not been appropriately validated or lack a strong biological rationale. This in turn inhibits the development of new and innovative therapies. Here we will study a method that quantifies changes in integrin-linked cell adhesion to better differentiate high-risk (defined as SLN positive melanoma) from biologically indolent melanoma. First, we will study consecutive cases of cutaneous melanoma from across the United States and Europe and correlate a molecular profile of cell adhesion with SLN status. Second, we will study how the inhibition of certain aspects of integrin adhesion affects melanoma growth and metastasis in vivo. We expect that our research will validate methods to identify high-risk melanoma that outperform the standard of care, reduce the rate of unnecessary SLN procedures and identify patients with high-risk melanoma overlooked by current procedures. Moreover, a better understanding of the molecular machinery that drives metastasis will create new therapeutic opportunities. The candidate’s long term goal is discover novel characteristics of malignant melanocytes that enable the development of new and innovative diagnostic methods and therapies. The mentored career development award will help the candidate acquire new methodological, professional and leadership skills to independently, successfully and meaningfully contribute to the fields of cell adhesion/cancer/melanoma research in the years to come. Specifically, the plan is to pursue the following training activities: 1.) Acquire expertise in studying melanoma using mouse models; use these models to test and optimize drugs and drugs combinations. 2.) Acquire experience in interpreting the histological features of melanoma; broaden my understanding of the biological concepts used by dermatopathologists to characterize melanoma. 3.) Acquire expertise in designing diagnostic biomarker studies; learn statistical methods, specifically methods that can be used to analyze complex datasets. 4.) Build the professional and leadership skills to bring together and lead an international consortium of melanoma investigators. The candidate will be mentored by a team of national experts in the field of cancer research. Mentoring and research will be carried out at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. Mayo Clinic offers core facility services for all mainstream standardized biomedical research methods. This includes tissue archives and bio-banking, animal housing and animal care, optical imaging, including high-end confocal microscopes, all methods related to histology, including RNA and DNA in-situ hybridization, targeted gene expression-based methods including microfluidic Fluidigm technology, and all mainstream ‘omics’ methods. All services are fully staffed with trained technicians. Moreover, there is scientific staff available to trouble-shoot experiments. These resources are all within walking distance from the candidate’s laboratory. Moreover, Mayo Clinic has a large staff of medical indexers, software programmers, application specialist and bio-information scientists. Because of the size of the clinic, there are medical specialists and subspecialists on hand for all areas of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE While dermatologists encourage patients to undergo skin cancer screening exams to detect melanoma early, it remains challenging to differentiate the truly aggressive from the indolent pigmented lesion.

"Identifying hereditary cancer patients in low-resource community cancer settings using an innovative informatics solution PROJECT SUMMARY . Hereditary cancer risk assessment in low-resource community cancer settings is a signiﬁcant unmet clinical need. Unfortunately, most community cancer clinics do not have adequate access to genetics expertise and patients are not systematically assessed for hereditary risk. New cost-eﬀective and practical approaches are needed to assess and identify patients at risk for hereditary cancer community cancer settings where rural, minority, and underserved patients receive cancer care. ItRunsInMyFamily, Inc and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) have partnered to develop ItRunsInMyFamily.com (ItRuns), a simple, scalable informatics tool that uses artiﬁcial intelligence and social networking to collect family health history from patients and assess for hereditary cancer risk. For this project we will develop a functional prototype and demonstrate feasibility of ItRuns as a simple, low-cost approach for identifying hereditary cancer patients in low-resource, community cancer settings. By successfully achieving the outcomes from this Phase I project, we will have a clear path to develop the technology, expertise, and evidence to make a signiﬁcant impact on hereditary cancer risk assessment in low-resource community cancer settings.

"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9749060,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'community clinic', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'health care service organization', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2019,733691,-0.0007502007666792748
"The AYA-RISE Intervention: Risk Information and Screening Education for Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer Predisposition Syndromes ABSTRACT Growing evidence shows that hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of cancer patients, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs). Genetic counseling is therefore recommended for all AYAs with new cancer diagnoses, for whom results can lead to future cancer screening, risk-reducing surgeries, and reproductive counseling. Testing can also have a domino effect, identifying other affected relatives and reducing cancer risk in entire families. AYAs require unique considerations when communicating cancer risk due to wide variability in developmental and emotional maturity. Genetic counseling necessitates complex cognitive and affective processing from AYAs, ideally resulting in an active ownership of their condition and a commitment to life-long health behavior change. This tall order comes as AYAs are forming their identity, gaining parental independence, and considering future childbearing – often under the shadow of enormous personal or family losses from cancer. These factors complicate AYAs' ability to weigh tradeoffs of genetic testing and screening recommendations – sometimes with tragic consequences. Unfortunately, there have been few if any efforts to optimize cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs. The goal of this project is to develop, implement and test an AYA-specific intervention for cancer risk communication and decision-making. Our interdisciplinary team of experts in health communication, cancer genetics, oncology, and pediatric psychology from 4 major Cancer Risk Programs will develop AYA-RISE (Risk Information and Screening Education), a web-based intervention comprised of (1) an interactive chatbot designed to communicate genetic information to AYAs in developmentally appropriate ways; and (2) an individualized patient portal, serving as an educational resource and longitudinal repository for cancer risk and screening information. Iterative user testing with qualitative feedback from AYAs will be used to optimize the program prior to conducting a type I hybrid implementation effectiveness trial of AYA-RISE. Our aims are: Aim 1: To refine and pilot AYA-RISE, adapting implementation to ensure feasibility and acceptability among AYAs with cancer risk syndromes, their family members, and providers. Aim 2: To test AYA-RISE among AYAs with cancer predisposition syndromes at 4 centers to determine impact on (1) patient knowledge of cancer risk and recommended screening; (2) psychological distress; (3) patient ownership of information; and (4) follow-up for recommended care. Aim 3: To evaluate implementation outcomes of AYA-RISE, including ways that AYAs use the chatbot and patient portal, and AYA, family, and provider experiences, to facilitate future dissemination. If successful, this study will yield a scalable, patient- and family-centered intervention to improve cancer risk communication and decision-making for AYAs and their families, with an ultimate goal of cancer risk reduction. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes affect 5-10% of patients with incident cancers, with heightened risk among patients who develop cancer at a young age, especially adolescents and young adults (AYAs). As a result, genetic counseling and testing is increasingly recommended for AYAs with new cancer diagnoses so that screening for new cancers can take place; however, no AYA-specific models for cancer risk communication and decision-making have been developed.

"SWOG NCORP Research Base PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The SWOG National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base (RB) has established itself as an innovative, collaborative, and integral part of the NCI's publicly funded cooperative group enterprise. The overall mission of the SWOG NCORP RB is to rapidly design, activate and complete biologically-driven, scientifically important, and clinically meaningful studies in cancer prevention, control, and cancer care delivery, in adults, adolescents and young adults with or at risk for cancer, and to improve quality of life and quality of survivorship for those with malignancies. Over the last grant cycle, the SWOG NCORP RB exceeded expectations with regard to scientific productivity, rapid dissemination of results, inclusiveness, faculty and student training, administrative efficiency, novel and complex trial designs, and advancement of and incorporation of the patient voice into all aspects of our work. In particular, the SWOG NCORP RB opens high-impact trials and conducts and completes them efficiently. During the reporting period, we accrued a total of 11,470 patients, of which 9897 (86%) were placed onto SWOG-coordinated studies, and 1573 (14%) were SWOG sites enrolling onto non-SWOG studies. SWOG NCORP institutions provided 45% of the accrual (n=4451) to SWOG-coordinated studies. Our results are widely disseminated and have informed multiple practice symptom management and survivorship guidelines. We published results from a large number of studies conducted during the last two cycles (125 manuscripts; 58 abstracts), with 34% issued in journals with an impact factor > 10. Overall, 96 NCORP site members were represented as authors in 54 NCORP manuscripts and abstracts. Over the next grant cycle, we will continue to expand our administrative and data infrastructure, with initiatives addressing patient reported outcomes, a robust and modern data management and patient reported outcomes core, enhanced engagement with community investigators and non-traditional partners, augmented education and involvement of patient advocates, and new quality initiatives. We will expand our research efforts in healthcare disparities across all committees, and we will collaboratively design, conduct, and accrue to novel and practice changing studies, in order to reduce the burden of cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall mission of the SWOG National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program Research Base is to rapidly design, activate and complete biologically-driven, scientifically important, and clinically meaningful studies in cancer prevention, control and cancer care delivery in adults, adolescents and young adults with or at risk for cancer, and to improve quality of life and quality of survivorship for those with malignancies.",SWOG NCORP Research Base,9772877,UG1CA189974,"['Address', 'Administrative Efficiency', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Advocate', 'Basic Science', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Control Research Program', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Oncologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational trial', 'Voice', 'Work', 'academic program', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'care delivery', 'data management', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'expectation', 'experience', 'faculty community', 'global health', 'health care disparity', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'programs', 'social media', 'software systems', 'student training', 'survivorship', 'symptom management', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'translational medicine', 'treatment risk', 'trial design', 'underserved minority', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,UG1,2019,5754875,0.05007978735470771
"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9724401,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging biomarker', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,585112,-0.03455432660644354
"Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia The American Cancer Society estimates that 48,330 new cases of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx will be reported this year. When diagnosed at early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83%. However, when diagnosed at intermediate or advance stages, the 5-year survival rate drops to 62% and 38%, respectively. In addition, while early stage treatment may only require minor surgery to remove the localized tumor, later stage treatment could require surgical removal of parts of the face and neck, hence drastically reducing the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, benign oral lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or early invasive cancer even for healthcare professionals. As a result, only 31% of patients are diagnosed at early stages despite the fact that the oral cavity is easily accessible for direct examination. Hence, there is a critical need for new clinical technologies for reliable early diagnosis of oral cancer and dysplasia. Several screening tools for oral cancer have been commercially available, including exfoliative cytology, vital staining, salivary test, and optical interrogation; however, none of them have been demonstrated to be capable of clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that several biomarkers for oral cancer and dysplasia can be accurately quantified by endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) thus enabling levels of sensitivity and specificity adequate for early detection. This bioengineering research grant focuses on developing and validating a cost-effective wide-field multispectral FLIM endoscope for noninvasive in situ detection of oral cancer and dysplasia. To that end we have developed three specific aims. Aim 1: To design and build a cost-effective multispectral FLIM endoscope for in vivo imaging of epithelial tissue in the oral cavity. Aim 2: To develop algorithms for fast and automated FLIM based early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. Aim 3: To quantify prospectively in a pilot clinical study the capability of the proposed FLIM endoscopic tools for noninvasively early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. The successful completion of these aims will result in a novel, accurate and cost-effective clinical tool for noninvasive in situ early detection of cancer and dysplasia. Such a tool could potentially help to improve significantly both the life expectancy and the quality of life for the more than 33,000 oral cancer patients being diagnosed each year at intermediate and advance stages. Beyond early diagnosis, this tool could also assist at every step involved on the clinical management of oral cancer patients, including treatment guidance and monitoring of disease recurrence. Finally, the demonstrated success of this clinical tool in oral epithelial cancer will herald future success with other cancers of epithelial origin, which accounts for more than 80% of all cancers. Early detection of both new and recurrent oral cancer holds great promise for improving both the survival rate and the quality of live of these patients. The proposed work is to develop a clinical tool capable of quantifying noninvasively different biomarkers associated to oral epithelial cancer progression and detecting early stage oral cancer and dysplasia. Such tool will revolutionize oral epithelial cancer management by allowing not only early screening and diagnosis, but also treatment guidance and monitoring for disease recurrence.",Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia,9920692,R01CA218739,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Coenzymes', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Epithelial', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Situ', 'Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mild Dysplasia', 'Minor Surgical Procedures', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring for Recurrence', 'Neck', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Oral Stage', 'Oral cavity', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Salivary', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'early screening', 'exfoliative cytology', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'oral dysplasia', 'oral lesion', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2019,499903,0.050045383744887637
"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once. This will help scientists find important genetic features of canine cancers, match them to specific human cancers, and translate what we learn into new cancer therapeutics.",Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,9671372,R37CA218570,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Canis familiaris', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dog family', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Silicones', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Veterinarians', 'actionable mutation', 'analysis pipeline', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'citizen science', 'classifier algorithm', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational cancer research', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R37,2019,634586,0.06462926744967369
"DR. EPS: Drug Repurposing for Extended Patient Survival Project Summary Human cancers are complex diseases that present vast heterogeneity, leading to widely different survival outcomes. Thus actionable and robust predictive models for cancer prognosis are much needed for more personalized treatment and disease management. However, There has been severely lacking of therapeutically actionable computational methods, which explicitly model patient survival difference as the objective while integrating multi-dimension high-throughput genomics data. To solve this issue, we propose a novel actionable framework for caner drug repurposing, called DR. EPS (Drug Repurposing for Extended Patient Survival). Towards this goal, we will develop the following strategies: (1) Constructing and validating a new class of hybrid-learning based, multi-omics prognosis modeling approach, using seven diverse liver cancer population cohorts. (2) Developing and experimentally validating an actionable computational drug- repurposing framework to improve the survival of high-risk liver cancer patients, using big sets of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics data. (3) Building a user-friendly webtool that accelerates such bench-to-bed transition for liver cancer treatment. We expect that this project will be groundbreaking in many aspects, including building new prognostic models on multi-omics data sets, identifying new repurposed drugs to extend high-risk liver cancer patient life-spans, and providing a first-hand drug reposition resource for liver cancer therapeutics research community. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop an actionable drug-repurposing framework, in order to extend the survival time of high-risk liver cancer patients. We will first build and validate novel and robust prognostic computational models that integrate multi-omics cancer data, then use signatures obtained from the high-risk survival group are to identify repurposed drug candidates. This study is expected to enhance more personalized management and accelerate research in drug repurposing and reposition in liver cancers.",DR.

"Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tissue based cancer research and therapy development are significantly challenged by strong tumor heterogeneity, biased information derived from two-dimensional tissue sections, spatially distorted genetic biomarker profiles in tissue space, and lack of dynamic Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) characterizations, presenting a serious barrier to enhance cancer research and treatment. Informatics tools for three- dimensional (3D) digital pathology imaging data capturing both histology hallmarks and molecular biomarkers from both static and dynamic environments are promising to create longitudinal human tumor atlas, necessary for in-depth TME and its progression study. We, therefore, propose to create a scalable and effective 3D digital pathology analytics framework for large-scale 3D pathology imaging data, providing novel and accessible methods on pathology image integration, analysis, visualization, and 3D spatial pathology/biomarker data query for efficient test and discovery of spatial interactions of 3D pathology and biomarker objects in cancer research and targeted therapy development.",Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,9827695,U01CA242936,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Online Systems', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'web app']",NCI,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,392987,0.030397887741674887
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,9614864,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,394948,0.012116036495842065
"Deep Learning in the context of Multispectral optoacoustic tomography Administrative supplement ABSTRACT for Administrative Supplement: Current methods identified at late to identify pancreatic cancer are suboptimal stage resulting in a substantially unmet clinical with the majority of cases need. The current imaging approaches are often limited in spatiotemporal resolution and specificity with high inter- and intra-reader variability in radiological exams that often result in flawed evaluation in identifying pancreatic cancer. Our original grant R01EB020125 aimed to utilize UPRT nanoparticles containing IR780 dye to detect pancreatic cancer using Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging. The objective of our administrative supplement is to develop machine learning algorithms to accurately, objectively and consistently assess and distinguish pancreatic cancer versus normal pancreas as utilizing MSOT images. Building upon our experience in theranostic nanoparticles, MSOT imaging, and machine and deep learning, the focus of this supplement is to identify molecular features of pancreatic cancer using MSOT. As MSOT is a new imaging modality, interpreting its images will be challenging for medical professionals. Therefore, we will develop a computer-assisted image analysis (CAIA) system which will help physicians to interpret these images accurately and consistently, minimizing inter-reader variability. Similarly, we will develop and evaluate a machine-learning classifier to quantitatively identify pancreatic cancer. Together, these studies aim to optimize and validate our novel MSOT imaging combined with machine learning to identify pancreatic cancer. This project extends our existing grant which develops a pancreatic tumor targeted nanoparticle detectable using multispectral optoacoustic tomography to include evaluation of the images using deep learning. The deep learning algorithms will segment possible pancreatic cancer regions and identify features to characterize possible pancreatic cancer regions.",Deep Learning in the context of Multispectral optoacoustic tomography Administrative supplement,9750320,R01EB020125,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Algorithms', 'Clinical', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Dyes', 'Evaluation', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Pancreas', 'Physicians', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Resolution', 'Specificity', 'Systems Analysis', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'optoacoustic tomography', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'spatiotemporal', 'theranostics']",NIBIB,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,133300,0.04105752009807581
"Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Modern digital pathology departments produce a tremendous amount of whole slide image data, which is quickly growing to petabyte scale. This plethora of data presents an unprecedented treasure chest for all kinds of medical machine learning tasks, including improvements in precision medicine.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of digital slides are not annotated on the image level, so histological points of interest are not integrated with the clinical notes or genetics associated with a patient. In contrast to other disciplines, manual labeling is not only cumbersome and time-consuming, but given the decades-long training of a pathologist, it is exorbitantly expensive and, due to clinical time constraints, impractical. Moreover, the time- dependent relationship between a patient's histology and genotype is not quantitatively leveraged to recommend combination therapies. Genetics informs us of important driver mutations, but how multiple cell types interact with these mutants over time in the tumor microenvironment to become histologically evident is less clear.  Deep learning synthesizes generations of pathologist knowledge as accurate quantitative models. Given a picture of a patient's morphology, I provide a tool that in four seconds finds the top ten most similar patients with their diagnoses, to support a pathologist's diagnosis decisions under the time pressures of active surgery. Recording the pathologist inspecting a slide at the microscope automatically annotates observed slide regions with time. Not only amenable for learning models that predict whether or not a region is salient to a pathologist making a diagnosis, this also allows all slides in a hospital to be annotated to identical criteria with only a representative sample of slides. I have submitted a manuscript reporting 85.15% accuracy in this saliency pre- diction task. This annotation greatly simplifies machine learning tasks, which can now focus on a non-redundant set of diagnostic regions in the slide, whether the application is to (a) find similar patients by morphology for diagnosis or (b) relate diagnostic morphology to the genetics.  Statistically modeling the relationship of the genotype to the histological phenotype in cancer opens promising new avenues in precision medicine. Taking a Big Data approach, I will leverage over 18,244 paired genome-histology samples to learn this model, using transfer learning techniques to maximize the value of all 18,244 samples for each tissue type. Genotype-phenotype model in hand, I will simulate the molecular clock in cancer, incrementally mutating the genome and predicting corresponding histology at each molecular time step. Through similar Q-learning that powers Google's champion artificial intelligence ``AlphaGo'', I will learn an agent that inhibits expression of a small set of mutant genes to maximize cancer progression-free survival time, by molecular time in the simulator. This not only measures the therapy's evolutionary durability, but also leads directly to experimentally testable hypotheses in 3D cell culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Digitized whole slide images of cancer tissue are a ``dark matter'' in the clinic, data that are often collected but rarely used quantitatively to model cancer or personalize medicine. I will, through close collaborations with practicing pathologists at globally leading cancer research hospitals, form statistical models of the histology evident in whole slides to (i) create clinical decision support tools that find similar patients by morphology alone to disambiguate cases that are difficult for a pathologist to diagnose under the time pressures of ongoing surgery, (ii) create a tool that learns which parts of a whole slide image are salient for a pathologist at the microscope to make a diagnosis, which greatly facilitates the deep learning techniques underlying [i] and [iii] by discarding redundant histological image data, and (iii) create a system that relates genotype to histological phenotype in cancer and learns an agent which leverages this system to determine the optimal multistage combination therapy to drive the histology towards health such that cancer progression-free survival time is maximized in the patient of interest. In this way, my statistical models will transform the vast dark matter of diagnosed histology data, representing generations of pathologist knowledge at these leading hospitals, into an indispensable resource for surgery, pathology, genetics, and precision medicine.","Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization.",9416817,F31CA214029,"['Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'CDH1 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Cells', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Drug Combinations', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'FGFR3 gene', 'Farming environment', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Medicine', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Second Opinions', 'Slide', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer imaging', 'cell type', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'improved', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mutant', 'overexpression', 'personalized medicine', 'petabyte', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'support tools', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F31,2018,44524,0.04308867222456179
"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians. Quality medical care requires an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic errors lead to lower quality research and can lead to reduced quality of care and inappropriate treatment decisions that result in harm to patients.

"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,9486120,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,321839,0.011864930349052592
"Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality and approximately 5% of individuals will develop colorectal cancer during their lifetimes. However, colorectal cancer is highly preventable if detected early. Colonoscopies are the most common form of colorectal cancer screenings and all adults between the ages of 50 and 74 are recommended to receive a colonoscopy at least once every 10 years. This study will examine how two recent policies, coverage mandates and high-deductible health plans, that change consumer cost-sharing for colonoscopies have changed patient adherence to these guidelines among the commercially insured population. This study will also examine how changes in patient utilization of colonoscopies have led to changes in colorectal cancer detection and mortality. These policies have created a rapidly changing cost- sharing environment for patients and so fully understanding the patient health effects of these policies is will help inform policy makers on the patient health effects of these changes. Recent years have also seen a rapid increase in data, computing power, and analytical methodologies. This study will apply recent advances in data mining techniques to one of the largest sources of data available to researchers. The machine learning approaches used in this study will two sources of bias that are potentially present in traditional approaches—multiple hypothesis testing and selective reporting of results. The machine learning model approaches will also be used to estimate heterogeneity in treatment effects, which will help inform policy makers of how to tailor cost-sharing policies for colonoscopy services. Several recent policies have substantially changed consumer cost-sharing for screening colonoscopy services, which are highly effective in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer, among the commercially insured population. Very little is known about if this rapidly changing environment changes the utilization of preventive cancer screening. This study aims to apply recent advances in machine learning and data mining to fill this knowledge gap and examine if recent changes in coverage mandates and insurance benefit design have affected colonoscopy utilization and patient health.",Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health,9502260,R21CA219229,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deductibles', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Services', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Econometric Models', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Future', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Site', 'Source', 'Surgical complication', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'colon cancer patients', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'health plan', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'response', 'screening', 'treatment effect']",NCI,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2018,205694,0.044529712437741016
"Integration of Clinical and Omic Data for Improved Prediction of Patient Outcome Integration of Clinical and Omic Data for Improved Prediction of Patient Outcome PI: Matthew Ruffalo – Sponsors: Ziv Bar-Joseph, Stefﬁ Oesterreich A Project Summary This project comprises a data integration and machine learning methodology to improve performance in predicting patient outcome – speciﬁcally, response to cancer treatments. Multiple disparate data types will be combined for this task, including omic data (somatic mutations, gene expression, methylation), interaction networks, drug target information, and previously-unavailable clinical data, to produce better predictions of response to speciﬁc cancer treatments.  The proposed methods will use relationships between genes and proteins (often represented as protein in- teraction networks) to construct composite features from omic data, and use these features as inputs to machine learning algorithms, to improve prediction performance of classiﬁcation methods when applied to clinically rel- evant prediction tasks. Additionally, this project will use clinical data at a level that is not typically available for breast cancer samples, obtained via the Center for Big Data for Better Health (BD4BH) collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. This data includes time-series clinical data spanning ﬁve years of breast cancer treatment, such as medication administration, laboratory results, pathology reports, symptoms, and other types of data. This clinical data will be integrated into composite features in order to fur- ther improve prediction performance. This feature construction methodology will also allow the investigation of which cellular processes and pathways are most strongly associated with clinical outcomes, such as response to speciﬁc treatments and patient survival.  While this approach shows promise in improving classiﬁcation/prediction performance in clinically relevant tasks such as survival and response to treatment, models learned from these integrated features may still overﬁt the classiﬁcation task and may not generalize to other cancers or drugs with similar mechanisms of action. As such, this method will integrate cell line expression data from the LINCS project into the predictive features. The LINCS program has proﬁled gene expression changes in cell lines under two broad categories: introduction of small molecules, and gene knockouts. Both sets of data will be used to constrain the sets of genes that are used as features for prediction of response to treatment of certain drugs. A central hypothesis of this proposal is that many cellular processes and cancer types respond in similar ways to such perturbations, allowing the use of a multi-task learning method to identify the commonalities in cellular response to these drugs across cell lines. Such methods will also allow for identiﬁcation of cell-type-speciﬁc and cancer-speciﬁc responses to such perturbations, identifying those networks and processes that speciﬁcally relate to response to treatment in speciﬁc cancers. Results will be validated via new in vitro cell line experiments, demonstrating that the constructed features are informative in clinical settings. 1 Integration of Clinical and Omic Data for Improved Prediction of Patient Outcome PI: Matthew Ruffalo – Sponsors: Ziv Bar-Joseph, Stefﬁ Oesterreich A Project Narrative This project proposes improvements in targeted cancer treatment, by providing more accurate prediction of re- sponse to cancer drugs based on a patient's speciﬁc somatic mutations, differential expression, methylation, and clinical data. This improved performance will be accomplished via feature construction and machine learning techniques, producing patient-speciﬁc treatment recommendations of which treatments will be most effective. 1",Integration of Clinical and Omic Data for Improved Prediction of Patient Outcome,9469716,F32CA216937,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Breast Cancer Treatment', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology Report', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Recommendation', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Universities', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'data integration', 'differential expression', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'knockout gene', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'medication administration', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'response', 'small molecule', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NCI,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,59038,0.0011485483310729534
"Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Classification of a patient’s cancer is critical for personalizing their therapy, and in many cases involves the pathologic examination of tissues treated with multiple immunohistochemical stains. This process is highly subjective, leading to problems with reliable classification and suboptimal treatment and this proposal is focused on developing software tools to improve the reliability of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. These tools will provide a reliable means of interpreting information derived from a practice known as immunohistochemistry to improve the consistency of diagnosis and patient outcomes.",Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,9507539,U01CA220401,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cations', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer survival', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'dashboard', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'health management', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'interactive tool', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplasm resource', 'oncology', 'open source', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,467872,0.03156145850870687
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9433637,K00CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic predictors', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'inter-individual variation', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K00,2018,73814,0.021082781120625484
"A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research Project Summary Cancer research is now a data-driven discipline, but only a minority of cancer researchers are data scientists. This severely restricts our ability to effectively study and cure the disease. The far reaching significance of our project is in federating disparate data and computational resources in order to provide a unifying analysis platform for computational cancer research.  We will extend the popular scientific workbench Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org) so that it can integrate with distributed data and compute resources used and needed by cancer researchers, including those resources in the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (NCR DC). Our Federated Galaxy system will allow users to seamlessly access NCR DC data across multiple resources. It will support multiple analysis scenarios tuned to skills and computational requirements of individual researchers.  The aims of this project are: Aim 1. Extend Galaxy for working with distributed cancer genomics and phenotypic data. This will enable Galaxy users to access both public and private cancer data regardless of their actual physical location. Best-practice approaches will be used for accessing restricted datasets.  Aim 2. Enhance Galaxy for context-aware, distributed cancer genomics analyses using shared workflow representations. This will enable Galaxy users to run genomics analyses on different clouds, ultimately reducing the time, cost, and data transfer associated with analyses.  Aim 3. Apply Federated Galaxy to precision oncology research. Workflows developed in this aim will leverage the technologies in Aims 1 and 2 to benchmark machine learning algorithms for predicting tumor phenotype and drug response. Interactive reports will summarize benchmarking results and utilize ITCR visualizations for deep dives into results.  Our system will provide a singular access point to distributed cancer datasets and will enable these data to be analyzed within a single portal in a way that satisfies multiple analysis scenarios and utilizes diverse computational resources. Finally, a cloud-centric Galaxy built for the NCR DC will substantially grow the community of users working with the GDC and the NCR DC. This is because Galaxy brings with itself a vibrant world-wide community of users and developers, which numbers tens of thousands of scientists. These individuals will help to tune the GDC and other resources within the NCR DC to the needs of real-life analysis scenarios and will enrich the set of tools accessible to cancer researchers. Project Narrative This project will develop a user-friendly scientific analysis workbench for analyzing cancer genomics data on the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons cloud platform. The workbench will democratize access to cloud-based cancer genomic analyses.

"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer.

"Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bioconductor PROJECT SUMMARY  The Bioconductor project is rooted in recognition that efﬁcient, rigorous, and reproducible analysis of high- dimensional data can be achieved when statisticians, biologists, and computer scientists federate efforts in a transparent and carefully engineered way. The project Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bio- conductor devises new approaches to carrying out genome-scale analysis of cancer data using cloud computing environments. The proposal is based on strategies that have proven highly effective in ﬁfteen years of supporting collaborative and carefully engineered software for genome scale analysis in computational biology in the Biocon- ductor project, based on the highly portable and widely adopted R language and environment for data analysis. In Aim 1 we develop architecture and infrastructure for scalably harvesting cloud-based representations of large- scale cancer genome studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, creating formal high-performance workﬂows for processing and interpreting cancer genome analyses, and providing packaging and data distribution schemes for moving data to the cloud for scalable analysis there. In Aim 2 we create and support independent creation of intuitive and cancer-relevant interface components supporting reproducible interactive exploration and analysis using the facilities of Rstudio. In Aim 3 we update and generalize the Bioconductor MLInterfaces metapackage to support advanced machine learning using the cancer-oriented strategies and facilities devised in Aims 1 and 2. Our proposal will beneﬁt large numbers of cancer researchers who will be taking advantage of cloud resources, probably with R close to hand, by marrying strengths of cloud-centric strategies for data archiving and query resolution, to the strengths of Bioconductor development and analysis capabilities. We have letters of support from the leadership of the three NCI Cancer Cloud Pilot projects for this project. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite major advances in elucidating mechanisms of tumor initiation and proliferation, treatment strategies for many cancers are ineffective, and patient-to-patient variation in treatment response suggests that personal targeting of cancer based on tumor molecular proﬁles will be necessary. This proposal takes a design and architecture approach from a widely used project for analyzing general data arising in genome-scale biology, and adapts it to new NCI-supported cloud-based data archives and analysis environments. The proposal will accelerate identiﬁcation of sources of variation of tumor responsiveness to treatment and will aid physicians in devising personalized antitumor strategies.",Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bioconductor,9478159,U01CA214846,"['Acceleration', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Animal Cancer Model', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioconductor', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Harvest', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Leadership', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motivation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'analytical method', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer type', 'cloud based', 'computing resources', 'data archive', 'data format', 'data submission', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome analysis', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomics cloud', 'high dimensionality', 'novel strategies', 'patient variability', 'portability', 'prototype', 'response', 'software development', 'spelling', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation', 'usability']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2018,438654,0.08727810257166625
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation. The research will establish  resources and software to contribute such methodologies for the Genome Data Analysis Network  projects that will subsequently be released into the public domain to benefit the entire scientific  community.",UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,9549013,U24CA210990,"['Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North Carolina', 'Oncogenic', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Subtype', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'exceptional responders', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient response', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2018,449240,0.03126278821829813
"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9428444,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'molecular imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,188952,0.04765487375809762
"Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing. We will make our data, analysis methods and results readily available to a broad group of researchers within a cloud computing framework. NARRATIVE MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt) RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate levels of gene products, including proteins that are drug targets in cancer. In order to shift medical practice towards personalized treatments, the proposed research will apply innovative analysis methods to understand the role of miRNA expression on survival and drug response, within the context of DNA, RNA and protein data generated in a large research network. This will help identify cancer subtypes, and individual patient phenotypes, in which alterations in miRNA expression can lead to particular cancer progression pathways and treatment responses, in order to inform disease management.",Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics,9538631,U24CA210952,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biogenesis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Targeting', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Sequences', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'flexibility', 'gene product', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor progression', 'working group']",NCI,BRITISH COLUMBIA CANCER AGENCY,U24,2018,1,0.07327143489661185
"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health. The proposed research seeks to develop new technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer exhibits misregulation of metabolic process relative to normal cells.

"NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION ABSTRACT This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-CA-17-025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the few cancers with increasing incidence in the United States. Survival of patients with HCC is poor because most patients are diagnosed at late stages when treatment options are limited. HCC surveillance can detect cancers early and improve survival but it is inconsistently implemented. Not all liver nodules detected on surveillance imaging are malignant, these indeterminate nodules require follow up imaging to determine if they are HCC. This proposal assembles a team of specialists with complementary expertise in liver diseases, liver cancer, radiology, engineering, statistics, and information technology. The goals are to: (1) Improve HCC surveillance uptake in patients with cirrhosis by leveraging electronic medical records to remind healthcare providers and patients when they are due for screening tests; (2) Leverage analytic morphomics and machine learning to increase the detectability of HCC at an early stage; and (3) Increase detectability of HCC at an early stage using tagged HCC-specific peptides. We have worked closely together for many years and have participated/led many NIH funded clinical research networks. We have expertise and experience to carry out the proposed studies and will collaborate with other centers in the Liver Center Network to validate the methods/models we develop. We will also enroll patients with cirrhosis and collect data and specimens and provide access to existing well characterized data and specimen repositories that include both prevalent and incident HCC for Trans-Network studies. We are confident we will be able to contribute to this Liver Cancer Network and to early detection of HCC in multiple ways. SIGNIFICANCE Regular screening of patients with cirrhosis can diagnose liver cancer early and improve survival but it is inconsistently done. We assembled a team of experts with complementary expertise to increase liver cancer screening using electronic medical record system to send reminders to healthcare providers and patients. Additionally, we use two novel methods to improve our ability to differentiate malignant from benign liver nodules allowing liver cancer to be diagnosed earlier.",NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION,9590246,U01CA230669,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'GPC3 gene', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hepatitis C', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Organ', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'patient-level barriers', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'radiomics', 'repository', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'statistics', 'surveillance imaging', 'surveillance strategy', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2018,664962,0.03672117475838184
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9547124,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,552250,0.06555928280115578
"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,9472091,R01CA163336,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'TERT gene', 'Techniques', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'knowledge of results', 'melanoma', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'resistance mechanism', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2018,327546,0.04833769808865616
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks.

"Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing Project Summary/Abstract Clinical data collection is accelerating rapidly, and in the future it will include both provider- and patient- generated data. Hidden within this mass of noisy observational data are clues as to factors influencing disease onset and outcome. Finding ways to exploit this trove of disease data can unlock a new perspective on disease processes. We can tackle disease both from the bottom-up, from experimental data generated in the laboratory, and from the top down, from clinical phenomena observed across human populations. A particularly impactful and prevalent disease is cancer. Each tumor harbors a unique combination of mutations driving a distinct set of oncogenic processes. Targeted therapies have been proposed to pinpoint these mutations, potentially requiring a vast array of therapeutic options. Cancer treatment often fails when drug resistance arises, another result of the complex combinatorial nature of tumor alterations. Combination therapies have been proposed as an approach to interfere with multiple disease signals simultaneously. However, identifying effective drug combinations, and the cancer types in which they are effective, is experimentally infeasible, leading to a push for computational solutions. In this proposal, we combine methods from social sciences and biostatistics to find the causal effect of a drug on cancer onset from observational clinical data. Both increased and decreased cancer rates in drug-takers are of equal interest, as they can inform us of disease processes and provide clinical impact. We are particularly interested in finding drug combinations that impact cancer. These combination effects are unlikely to have been detected, and our clinical data provides a unique resource for observing the effects of tens of thousands of drug combinations. We will pool the resulting causal drug effect estimates across the many cancers present in our data. To gain insight into the cellular processes underlying clinical effect, we will examine the impact of known cancer-causing drugs in vitro, using large public cell line assays. The accompanying goal is to provide Dr. Rachel Melamed with a career development experience to become an independent scientist. Her research will use observational health data to understand the genesis of cancer, prevent the disease, and discover new therapeutic options. This proposal takes advantage of the interdisciplinary strengths of the University of Chicago in computation, biostatistics, and medicine, as well as institutional resources in terms of data access and infrastructure. Dr. Melamed has assembled a team consisting of complementary mentors and collaborators with expertise in computation, statistics, translational medicine, personalized therapy, and cancer therapy. The career development plan focuses on enhancing her statistics and machine learning skills with structured coursework and mentorship, and gaining experience in biomedical applications via applied work and mentorship. This will provide Dr. Melamed with skills to model observational data and to integrate the results with experimental data. Project Narrative Clinical data has been shown to hold patterns relating drugs to cancer onset. Using this data to find drugs that increase cancer rates will provide insight into the disease and an opportunity for preventing some cancer cases. Discovery of drugs, and particularly drug combinations, that reduce cancer rates could suggest low-cost new therapeutic options.",Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing,9482427,K01ES028055,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Case Series', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Finding by Cause', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Skill', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Premalignant', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career development', 'clinical effect', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data access', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'life history', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'training opportunity', 'translational medicine', 'tumor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2018,124953,0.05142677019488783
"Hardwiring Mechanism into Predicting Cancer Phenotypes by Computational Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Few biomarkers derived from genome scale data have translated into improved clinical classification of cancer subtypes, in spite of the wealth of available genome-wide studies and of the corresponding application of numerous statistical algorithms. This widespread shortcoming derives from the pervasive use of ""off the shelf"" algorithms and machine learning techniques developed for image classification and language processing, which are naïve of the underlying biology of the system. Furthermore, for genome-wide data, the number of samples is often small relative to the number of potential candidate biomarkers, resulting in variable accuracy on independent test data despite high accuracy in the samples used for discovery, which contributes to the failure of clinical biomarkers. This problem - so called ""curse of dimensionality"" - is further exacerbated by the prohibitive cost of dramatically increasing sample size and by patient stratification into smaller subgroups for personalized and precision medicine. Disease phenotypes arise from distinct and specific perturbations in selected networks and pathways defined by the interactions of their molecular constituents. In cancer, these perturbations may reside in gene regulatory networks topology and state, in cell signaling activity, or in metabolic conditions. We hypothesize that by leveragin such prior biological information on cancer biology we will be able to reduce model complexity and build mechanistically justified predictive models. To pursue this hypothesis, we will develop an analytical framework to embed mechanistic constraints derived from network biology into the statistical learning process itself. Hence, this application will develop a novel suite of statistial learning algorithms that embed (Aim 1) gene expression regulatory networks, (Aim 2) cell signaling activity, and (Aim 3) metabolism to classify breast and prostate cancer. Throughout the study we will work closely with clinical collaborators to ensure that our method improve over and above current predictive and prognostic models. Finally, since in our study we will also generate mechanistic classifiers based on gene expression measurements obtained from clinical assays that are already commercially available (i.e., MammaPrint®, and Decipher®), our innovative models and predictors will be also readily available for clinical translation. Our mechanism-driven classifiers will simultaneously have greater accuracy and interpretability than classifiers developed without regard for the underlying biology of the disease. Furthermore, embedding biological mechanisms in the classifiers will also facilitate the identification of alternative therapeutic targets specific to each cancer subtype, potentially improving patient prognosis and health outcomes. Finally, the substantial curation of molecular pathways and biological networks we will carry on in the project will also provide a powerful resource for futur studies, and the methodologies we will develop will be also applicable to other cancer and other human diseases, like neurodegenerative disorders, hearth disease, and diabetes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative This study will use mechanistic biological knowledge to implement a suite of statistical algorithms for cancer patient classification, which will also reveal the biological reasoning behind the classification decision rules. In the study we will also apply our novel methods to develop improved biomarkers for breast and prostate cancer patient clinical stratification, with the ultimate goal of facilitating the selection of appropriate treatment. To achieve this goal we will directly improve the existing commercial tests offered to the patients, with an immediate clinical impact, since our biomarkers will be directly implementable into these assays, with the potential to quickly reach the bedside.",Hardwiring Mechanism into Predicting Cancer Phenotypes by Computational Learning,9447142,R01CA200859,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Models', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker development', 'cancer cell', 'cancer classification', 'cancer subtypes', 'candidate marker', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'functional group', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized health care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,384981,0.020420584775503965
"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,9787830,P50CA121973,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Antigens', 'Apoptotic', 'BRAF gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cell Vaccine', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immuno-Chemotherapy', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunology procedure', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interferon Alfa-2b', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Program Development', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specialized Program of Research Excellence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute', 'Unresectable', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career development', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'data management', 'design', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'immunogenic cell death', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'melanoma', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel vaccines', 'oncology', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P50,2018,500000,0.03268386148222658
"Learning radiomic signatures to early predict response of rectal cancer patients to neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy Abstract Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common newly diagnosed cancer and the 3rd most common cause of cancer death among US men and women. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer. Preoperative CRT has clearly improved rates of local disease control and colostomy free survival; however the response to therapy is heterogeneous. It would be very useful to be able to predict the individual risk of each patient, so that their therapy can be personalized. The goal of our study is to derive clinically useful radiomic signatures from multimodal imaging data for the early prediction of treatment outcomes in rectal cancer patients. Central to our methodology are 1) an improved deep learning model for automatically segmenting tumors from multimodal imaging data with high accuracy; and 2) a multi-task deep learning model for robustly learning informative radiomic features to predict survival and recurrence.

"Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center) SUMMARY-ABSTRACT  The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre- malignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre- melanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to myeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as shaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the Center for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary technical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision prevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the molecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk individuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials. This will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex tissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.  Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination with HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with three subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists and a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological specimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository will provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in prospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an oncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high- plex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate reagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications. Aim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to manage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most technically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each in preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm development. The resulting human browsable and machine-readable atlases are expected to yield new scientific discoveries, demonstrate the feasibility and utility of new technologies and help to reduce the incidence of life-threatening cancers of the skin and blood. NARRATIVE Construction of Pre-Cancer Atlases comprising detailed spatial and molecular data on cell state and omic data in melanoma and clonal hematopoiesis will join together the two primary means of diagnosing human cancer: histology and genetics. The atlases we construct will help to identify patients with pre-cancer skin lesions and blood conditions at risk of progressing to malignancy at a sufficiently early stage that aggressive disease can be prevented.",Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center),9627416,U2CCA233262,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Histology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Fee-for-Service Plans', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Oncologist', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Premalignant', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention therapy', 'Prevention trial', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Skin Cancer', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Stromal Cells', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'crowdsourcing', 'data acquisition', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'deep neural network', 'dimensional analysis', 'genetic analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'image visualization', 'individual patient', 'individualized prevention', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'laser capture microdissection', 'learning strategy', 'melanoma', 'member', 'neoplastic', 'new technology', 'prevent', 'prevention clinical trial', 'prospective', 'repository', 'skin lesion', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U2C,2018,6918530,0.03740921542403197
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and other factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature to advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose research to enhance the ability of researchers to utilize data from unstructured medical records in their translational cancer research programs.

"(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy This proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specific genetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having great expertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system. We will study age effects on PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the host and the tumor focusing on melanoma with some bladder cancer work, two tumors that are highly responsive to αPD-1 and/or αPD-L1 as proofs-of-concept, and residing in distinct anatomic compartments. In Aim 1 we study tumor PD-L1 intrinsic effects on αPD-L1 and αPD-1 treatment in melanoma and bladder cancer using transplantable B16 and inducible Nras/Cdk2n melanoma models, and transplantable MB49 and BBN-induced tumors for bladder cancer studies. We also use novel melanoma and BC models with tumor cell- specific PD-L1KO. We study 3 cohorts of elderly versus younger humans getting αPD-L1 or αPD-1 for melanoma or bladder cancer for human validation. We measure high-dimensional cell phenotypes and signaling responses, proteins and genes to maximize the information collected from human samples and mice using 23-color FACS, CyTOF, Luminex, Nanostring and other approaches. In Aim 2 we use all the above models and analytic strategies in young and aged PD-L1KO mice and WT or bone marrow chimeras to test hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic (host) PD-L1 signals in treatment outcomes in melanoma and bladder cancer. In Aim 3 the Systems Immunology team will use their innovative and successful computational modeling to identify age- related co-predictors of immunotherapy response and to identify candidate mechanisms for responders and non- responders. We will define a trajectory of immune system aging in mice at ultra-high resolution by performing a systems level integrative analysis of aging in Collaborative Cross and BL6 mice tracked in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. This trajectory will be used to understand how tumor response and treatment outcomes vary as a function of age, and to build a simple, low parameter (i.e., easily testable and clinically translated), predictive models of treatment response. We will test insights by analyzing immune data from aged versus young patients undergoing αPD-L1 and αPD-1 cancer immunotherapy in novel machine learning approaches that we pioneered to identify insights from mouse data that are relevant to humans. Coupling this disease information with the healthy human aging trajectory that we recently defined will allow us to adapt our mouse data to predict optimal treatments in humans based on chronological and immune aging. This combined trans-disciplinary approach will identify common age-related disabilities that reduce PD-L1/PD-1 based immunotherapy responses and suggest tailored treatments for optimal efficacy that could later be tested in validation sets. These data can also be applied to other types of immunotherapy as we will also test. Cancer is a disease of the aged, but therapies are generally modeled in the young. We study age effects on cancer immunotherapy in response to PQ2 to develop ways to optimize cancer immunotherapy in aged patients most at risk. We focus on the PD-L1/PD-1 axis that is the cornerstone of the most successful cancer immunotherapies to date.",(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy,9592156,R01CA231325,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Appearance', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Genes', 'Genetically Modified Animals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Validation', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell dimension', 'cohort', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune function', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'nano-string', 'neoplasm immunotherapy', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'preclinical study', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'ultra high resolution']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2018,582917,-0.0005139040325077091
"A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer Project Summary We seek to develop robust platforms for capturing, enumerating and analyzing circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells from the blood of cancer patients. We will leverage our previously developed precisely engineered microfilter platform that allows effective separation and collection of viable CTC from patient blood. In parallel, we have developed novel imaging methods perfectly suited for rapid analyses for circulating tumor cells, clusters and associated cancer cell subtypes (such as Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, or CAF). We propose to integrate these two novel technologies to create a robust diagnostic tool for clinical pathology as well as basic research that enables capture, enumeration, and analyses of circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells. Our multidisciplinary team proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Build and validate the technology to rapidly acquire CTC/CAF images using Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy and evaluate the images with a deep learning algorithm  2) Evaluation of the integrated platform for using CTC/CAF in predicting recurrence/survival in early stage  breast cancer patients For these studies in early stage breast cancer, we have robust collaborations with industry partners in Circulogix Inc (Microfilter technology for cell capture), ClearBridge Inc. (FPM imaging of the microfilter surface), and Google Software (Deep learning algorithm for analyzing FPM images of microfilter). The ability to reliably and rapidly detect and analyze CTC and associated cancer cells in early stage breast cancer patients would deliver a major new tool for oncology research, a platform for screening of novel drugs, and a critical advance in precision cancer management. Project Narrative (Relevance) Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) and circulating Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (cCAF) are the agents of spread of cancer (metastasis), which is a direct cause of a large number of cancer-related deaths. Our interdisciplinary team of pathologists, engineers, cancer cell biologists, and microscopists along with industry partners will combine their novel technologies to, for the first time, establish robust capture, rapid identification and enumeration of CTC, cCAF and their clusters from whole blood of early stage breast cancer patients. If successful, our approach would enable researchers to better diagnose metastasis, predict risk of recurrence, and help clinicians to employ personalized therapy through treatment plans tailored to suit individual patients, hence resulting in a significant impact on human health.",A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer,9631128,U01CA233363,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Minnesota', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Whole Blood', 'analytical tool', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'expectation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'liquid biopsy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,587514,-0.05234480705465865
"Determinants of pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma phenotypes in CDKN2A hereditary kindreds This proposal addresses Provocative Question #2. We will use innovative approaches to investigate how CDKN2A (which encodes p16) mutation carriers develop different cancer phenotypes (pancreatic cancer vs melanoma vs no cancer), and include both genetic and non-genetic factors. We have identified 4 large, multi- generational kindreds with a founder CDKN2A deleterious mutation (L16R, 47T>G). Our preliminary observations demonstrate that this mutant has lower expression and decreased ability to regulate cell cycle progression compared to wild type protein. Our sequencing studies of kindred members with different cancer phenotypes have identified potential variants in novel genes that modify risk (LGR6, a co-receptor of Wnt signaling and COL11A1, which participates in oncogenic signaling, including TGFbeta). We will determine the ability of the p16 mutant to promote transformation and how it is influenced by interaction with the above candidate modifier genes, LGR6 or COL11A1, in pancreatic cancer and melanoma. We will also develop novel computational models using machine deep learning, to generate networks that capture high dimensional features to integrate gene, biology, and cancer phenotype. This approach will be extended to kindreds with other CDKN2A mutations. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify genotypes of potential modifier genes in multiple kindreds that feature pancreatic cancer and melanoma and known to carry CDKN2A germline mutations. We will use genome wide variant coverage of germline DNA from CDKN2A carriers from the 4 large L16R kindreds, plus additional members in 42 other similar CDKN2A kindreds. We will identify candidate modifier genes in the kindreds by rule-based statistical genetic analysis of genotypes. (2) Define the impact of CDKN2A L16R mutation on the function of p16 and its interplay with candidate modifier genes. We will elucidate the biological significance of mutations in CDKN2A and candidate modifier genes using functional and high throughput methodologies by analyzing the mechanism underlying the interplay between p16 and modifier genes; define new pathways cooperating with this interplay using a combination of genome wide studies to assess transformation in cells carrying p16 mutant or wild-type background using well established in vitro and in vivo models. (3) Develop a deep learning network model to integrate genetic, biological and epidemiological data to accurately infer pancreatic cancer and melanoma phenotypes and age of onset in mutation carriers. We will apply a convolutional neural network, a deep learning algorithm in the training dataset, develop a back-propagation algorithm to fine tune “weights,” and construct mutation-gene networks to capture high-dimensional features for each disease subclass. We will acquire and disseminate new knowledge and tools to the scientific community. Our integrated methods and approach will bring insight into how different cancer phenotypes can occur with identical predisposing mutations, which can be applied to other cancer syndromes with similar challenges.

"Development of a pipeline tool to predict immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes PROJECT SUMMARY  Epitope-based cancer immunotherapies have been intensely investigated for decades, but have thus far met with mixed results in the clinical setting. Recent years have, however, witnessed a resurgence of interest based on advances in high-throughput sequencing approaches that allow rapid identification of cancer- associated, patient-specific mutations having the potential of being recognized as epitopes (neo-epitopes).  Previous studies defined binding affinity associated with immunogenicity for HLA class I MHC restricted CTL responses of viral and non-self origin. However, it is not clear if the same threshold is applicable to identify epitopes in self-antigens, such as the ones recognized in autoimmunity and cancer. Additional factors expected to play a crucial role in the immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes include the propensity of epitopes to be derived by natural processing, and subsequent capacity of being recognized by TCR. While several online tools are available for predicting processing and TCR recognition, the relative role of each of these factors (HLA binding, processing, TCR recognition) has not been analyzed in the cancer setting. Likewise, how the different online tools can be optimally combined to predict neo-epitopes has not been thoroughly addressed.  Accordingly, our study will experimentally establish the threshold for HLA binding affinity of neo- epitopes, validate the suitability of HLA binding prediction methods in a cancer setting, and establish whether predicted binding affinities can be suitably used in lieu of experimentally measured binding constants. We will also evaluate the predictive value of additional variables globally affecting neo-epitope immunogenicity, including allele-specific HLA binding thresholds, HLA-peptide binding stability, binding capacity of the somatic sequence from which a neo-epitope is derived, the predictive capacity of TAP and proteosomal cleavage algorithms and, to account for neo-epitope TCR interface effects, we will evaluate two alternative schemes based on analysis of the residue type occupying putative TCR contact positions. Finally, we will explore combining all neo-epitope immunogenicity predictors into a single pipeline and provide experimental validation of its predictive efficacy.  The proposed research will provide 1) the first in-depth characterization of the relative importance of different variables affecting neo-epitope immunogenicity, 2) the first integration of predictive tools for each of these variables into a single pipeline, and 3) freely available online access of a newly developed pipeline to the scientific community. This is highly innovative, since no such resource is currently available for epitope immunogenicity in general, and for cancer neo-epitopes in particular. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is intended to provide in-depth characterization of the importance of several variables affecting cancer neo-epitope immunogenicity. These findings in turn will allow the development of bioinformatic tools, and a unified analysis pipeline, towards the identification of cancer neo-epitopes. Identification of such epitopes is expected to allow quick identification of cancer-associated, patient-specific, mutations potentially recognized as epitopes, with direct applicability to the development of efficacious therapeutics.",Development of a pipeline tool to predict immunogenicity of cancer neo-epitopes,9405144,R21AI134127,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigens', 'Autoantigens', 'Autoimmunity', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Epitopes', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Literature', 'MHC Class I Genes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Side', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Therapeutic', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Weight', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'experimental study', 'immune activation', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neoantigens', 'peripheral tolerance', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIAID,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,R21,2018,270000,0.05803648368112555
"Characterization of Thyroid Nodules by Quantitative Ultrasound Project Summary Thyroid cancer is the most-common endocrine malignancy. Its incidence has tripled in the last thirty years. Diagnosis of thyroid cancer is difficult because 50% of people older than 65 have at least 1 thyroid nodule, but only 10% of the nodules are cancerous. Approximately 1.6 billion dollars are spent annually in the US to detect thyroid cancer. Conventional ultrasound is used to identify nodules that warrant a needle biopsy. However, 65% of needle biopsies are negative for cancer and 30% are “indeterminate.” The indeterminate nodules are surgically removed for definitive diagnosis and 75% of them prove to be benign. Therefore, well more than 80% of initially presenting nodules undergo unnecessary biopsies and more than 20% of them also undergo subsequent unnecessary surgery procedures. Accordingly, the broad objective of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility of using quantitative-ultrasound (QUS) methods to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules reliably and thereby to reduce the enormous cost and risks associated with unnecessary biopsies and surgical excisions. The first aim of the project is to develop and asses the ability of QUS to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules and to compare the ability of QUS to the ability of conventional methods to select nodules that warrant biopsies; the second aim is to expand QUS methods by combining existing QUS measures developed by Riverside Research with measures derived from so-called B-flow- imaging (BFI) and shear-wave-elasticity (SWE) techniques developed by GE; the third aim is to formulate an objective basis for planning future, prospective studies to translate the findings of the present study to a commercial instrument that can bring QUS-based nodule evaluation into the clinic. To achieve these three aims, QUS performance in classifying cancerous and benign nodules will be compared to the performance of conventional ultrasound and the results of fine needle cytology, molecular marker analyses, and, in the cases of that undergo surgical excision, histology, will used as gold standards. Classification will be performed using standard, well understood, linear, and non-linear methods, such as linear-discriminant analysis and support- vector machines respectively. If feasibility is successfully demonstrated in the proposed project, and if the demonstration of feasibility ultimately leads to future incorporation into an instrument capable of real-time QUS analysis for reliable nodule evaluation, then a highly significant technological advance will be realized that can provide valuable, risk-reducing, cost-effective health-care benefits for patients presenting with thyroid nodules.   PROJECT NARRATIVE: Thyroid cancer rates have tripled in the last thirty years, but current methods of diagnosis are very inefficient. Far too many thyroid biopsies and surgeries are performed with >80% of biopsies and >25% of thyroid surgeries being performed on benign nodules. The advanced ultrasound methods to be evaluated in this proposal seek to drastically reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and surgeries of benign thyroid nodules.",Characterization of Thyroid Nodules by Quantitative Ultrasound,9405532,R21CA212744,"['Achievement', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asses', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancerous', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cytology', 'Cytology Histology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Elasticity', 'Endocrine', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fine-needle biopsy', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostate', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroid Nodule', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'base', 'calcification', 'care costs', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'elastography', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lymph nodes', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'statistics']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2018,190102,-0.00023924959464234226
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly.

"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center.

"Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia The American Cancer Society estimates that 48,330 new cases of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx will be reported this year. When diagnosed at early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83%. However, when diagnosed at intermediate or advance stages, the 5-year survival rate drops to 62% and 38%, respectively. In addition, while early stage treatment may only require minor surgery to remove the localized tumor, later stage treatment could require surgical removal of parts of the face and neck, hence drastically reducing the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, benign oral lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or early invasive cancer even for healthcare professionals. As a result, only 31% of patients are diagnosed at early stages despite the fact that the oral cavity is easily accessible for direct examination. Hence, there is a critical need for new clinical technologies for reliable early diagnosis of oral cancer and dysplasia. Several screening tools for oral cancer have been commercially available, including exfoliative cytology, vital staining, salivary test, and optical interrogation; however, none of them have been demonstrated to be capable of clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that several biomarkers for oral cancer and dysplasia can be accurately quantified by endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) thus enabling levels of sensitivity and specificity adequate for early detection. This bioengineering research grant focuses on developing and validating a cost-effective wide-field multispectral FLIM endoscope for noninvasive in situ detection of oral cancer and dysplasia. To that end we have developed three specific aims. Aim 1: To design and build a cost-effective multispectral FLIM endoscope for in vivo imaging of epithelial tissue in the oral cavity. Aim 2: To develop algorithms for fast and automated FLIM based early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. Aim 3: To quantify prospectively in a pilot clinical study the capability of the proposed FLIM endoscopic tools for noninvasively early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. The successful completion of these aims will result in a novel, accurate and cost-effective clinical tool for noninvasive in situ early detection of cancer and dysplasia. Such a tool could potentially help to improve significantly both the life expectancy and the quality of life for the more than 33,000 oral cancer patients being diagnosed each year at intermediate and advance stages. Beyond early diagnosis, this tool could also assist at every step involved on the clinical management of oral cancer patients, including treatment guidance and monitoring of disease recurrence. Finally, the demonstrated success of this clinical tool in oral epithelial cancer will herald future success with other cancers of epithelial origin, which accounts for more than 80% of all cancers. Early detection of both new and recurrent oral cancer holds great promise for improving both the survival rate and the quality of live of these patients. The proposed work is to develop a clinical tool capable of quantifying noninvasively different biomarkers associated to oral epithelial cancer progression and detecting early stage oral cancer and dysplasia. Such tool will revolutionize oral epithelial cancer management by allowing not only early screening and diagnosis, but also treatment guidance and monitoring for disease recurrence.",Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia,9470668,R01CA218739,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Coenzymes', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Epithelial', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Situ', 'Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mild Dysplasia', 'Minor Surgical Procedures', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring for Recurrence', 'Neck', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Oral Stage', 'Oral cavity', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Salivary', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'early screening', 'exfoliative cytology', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'oral dysplasia', 'oral lesion', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2018,162511,0.050045383744887637
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,9475020,U54CA225088,"['Achievement', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAF gene', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Newsletter', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'acquired drug resistance', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical research site', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging modality', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2018,2147606,0.02248266142003714
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management.

"Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers PROJECT SUMMARY As a computational biologist, my long-term goal is to develop methods and tools to discover new or better therapeutics for cancers. In the past few years, I have identified drug-repositioning candidates for a number of primary cancers using Big Data approaches. These candidates have been validated successfully in preclinical mouse models. To maximize the utility of Big Data, I plan to translate the findings into therapeutics; therefore, I propose to develop methods to utilize transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers. Current preclinical and clinical approaches including the NCI MATCH trial select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations, yet patients may have no actionable mutations or multiple actionable mutations that are hard to prioritize, suggesting the need for other different types of molecular biomarkers. The recent efforts have enabled the large-scale identification of various types of molecular biomarkers through correlating drug sensitivity with molecular profiles of pre-treatment cancer cell lines. Computational methods to match these biomarkers to individual patients to inform therapy in the clinic are thus in high demand. The objective of this award is therefore to develop computational approaches to identify therapeutics for individual patients by leveraging large-scale biomarkers identified from cancer cell lines. Through conducing this research, I expect to expand my knowledge in cancer clinical trials, cancer genomics, cancer biology, and statistics. To achieve the goal, I have gathered seven renowned experts from different fields related to Big Data Science as mentors/advisors/collaborators: Primary Mentor Dr. Atul Butte in translational bioinformatics from UCSF, Co-mentor Dr. Samuel So in cancer biology from Stanford University, Co-mentor Dr. Mark Segal in statistics from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Andrei Goga in cancer biology from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Laura Esserman in breast cancer trials from UCSF, Collaborator Dr. John Gordan in liver cancer trials from UCSF and Collaborator Dr. Xin Chen in cancer biology from UCSF. With the support from my world- class mentors, advisors and collaborators, this award will prepare me to be a leader in developing big data methods that are broadly impactful. PROJECT NARRATIVE One goal of the precision medicine initiative is to select optimal therapies for individual cancer patients based on their molecular and clinical profiles. Current preclinical and clinical approaches select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations. This work is expected to employ the protein/gene expression based biomarkers computed from public databases to inform individualized cancer therapy.","Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers",9675371,K01ES028047,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Award', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Non-Malignant', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'data sharing', 'drug candidate', 'drug efficacy', 'drug sensitivity', 'efficacy testing', 'genetic signature', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'protein expression', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,171217,0.05114630385058626
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9487202,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'early screening', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2018,347700,-0.0021086688187394783
"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,9446810,R01CA214428,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'CLIA certified', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Designer Drugs', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Economics', 'Feedback', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Observational Study', 'Oregon', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer genomics', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'genomic profiles', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'user-friendly']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2018,647099,0.03255898047693833
"The UCLA Center in Early Detection of Liver Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major cause of death in cirrhotic patients. This neoplasm is associated with liver cirrhosis in more than 90% of cases. A method of detecting HCC accurately in its early stages would greatly improve our ability to manage and treat the disease. The UCLA Center aims to develop an effective and affordable blood-based method for the early detection of liver cancer. Our team consists of translational and clinical researchers with multi-disciplinary expertise in the areas of early detection, biomarkers, cancer surveillance, imaging, and biorepositories. We will focus on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood. ctDNA carryies cancer-specific genetic and epigenetic aberrations, which enable a noninvasive `liquid biopsy' for cancer diagnosis. Our diagnostic test is based on the DNA methylation patterns of cfDNA. Our integrated computational and experimental technologies can significantly boost the diagnostic power while dramatically reducing the cost. We have the following aims: (1) We will establish a longitudinal cohort of cirrhotic patients. The cirrhotic patients will be subject to ultrasound imaging screening and blood sample collection every 6 months. The UCLA liver clinic sees ~1200 cirrhotic patients per year. (2) We will establish a state-of-the-art biospecimen repository that includes plasma from individuals in the cohort, tissue from liver tumors after resection, and cirrhotic lesions after liver transplantation. (3) We will perform Phase 2 clinical assay validation and Phase 3 early detection validation for the diagnostic test. (4) We will contribute to the collaborative trans-network activities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop and validate a diagnostic test for the early detection of liver cancer.

"Integrating an Open Repository of Polygenic Risk Scores for Major Cancer Sites with a Visual Catalog PROJECT SUMMARY The current proposal, submitted to the special funding opportunity for Administrative Supplements for Integrative Data Analysis to Extend Research in Cancer Control and Population Sciences (NOT-CA-18-087), leverages the unique and rich data resource of the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI) comprising of >55,000 patients recruited at Michigan Medicine with complete array-based whole-genome genotyping data that are connected to rich longitudinal data retrieved from their electronic health records. In addition, we have access to information on behavioural data collected through a detailed questionnaire and geocoded residence information. These diverse sources of data allow us the possibility of creating novel and more accurate measures of exposures using questionnaire responses, structured and unstructured component of the electronic health record including clinical notes and the geocoded residential information. A key aspect of MGI is its enrichment for cancer outcomes. About 50% of the participants recruited so far have at least one neoplasm diagnosis in their health record. This is due to the recruitment of MGI participants from a perioperative setting. This cancer enrichment sets it apart from other biobanks and presents a unique opportunity at the University of Michigan Rogel Cancer Center for cancer control and population sciences research. Our proposal aspires to establish an analytical framework to distil summary statistics of published genome- wide association studies for cancer into polygenic risk scores, to construct known and novel cancer-related exposures from clinical free text and data mining of geocoded residential data, and to utilize them in a screen for associations across the catalogued medical phenome, the ensemble of clinical diagnoses and biomarkers that are derived from routinely ordered lab tests in MGI. Correlated co-morbidities could, if pre-symptomatic, be used to improve cancer risk prediction, while associated exposures could inform on targeted strategies for cancer prevention and risk stratification. Novel findings will be replicated (when feasible) in the publicly accessible data of the UK Biobank, a population-based study of up to half a million participants. To differentiate between pre-symptomatic and post-treatment features, we will probe the existing time- stamped data of MGI that permit retrospective insights of up to ten years into a participant’s electronic medical records. Since there is an urgent need to better communicate results from such big data exploration with a broad and multi-disciplinary audience, e.g. to inspire follow-up replication and new hypothesis generation in cancer epidemiology and furthering our understanding of susceptibility mechanisms for cancer, we will develop a webpage to allow intuitive and interactive result browsing and open sharing. The proposal showcases the advantage of harmonization, integration of large and complex databases towards impactful research and powerful discovery tools in cancer control and population sciences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Leveraging and harnessing the rich data resource of the cancer-enriched cohort of the Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal biorepository effort at Michigan Medicine, this unique integrative data analysis proposal attempts to integrate genes, exposure and health history information as archived in an individual’s electronic medical records under a unifying analytic and scientific discovery framework. The ultimate goal is to give shape and structure to disparate sources of data towards principled discovery, inference and prediction. Through the proposed research we hope to achieve improved risk prediction, risk stratification and targeted prevention of cancer. Tools will be developed for wider dissemination of the results via an online visual catalog and make the results from massive, complex and heterogeneous sources of data accessible to other researchers, stakeholders and community participants. The proposal will showcase the potential for discoveries in cancer population-studies using unique data features from MGI, a medical center-based biobank and simultaneously leverage our access to the large population-based biobank, namely the UK Biobank, for replication and confirmation studies. In that sense, the proposal carries out integrative data analysis in two directions: (a) integrated analysis of diverse sources of data within MGI and (b) integrated use of MGI in concert with data from a large publicly available biobank, the UK Biobank.",Integrating an Open Repository of Polygenic Risk Scores for Major Cancer Sites with a Visual Catalog,9765877,P30CA046592,"['Access to Information', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Archives', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Control', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Inherited', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention Measures', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genome', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cancer site', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'disease phenotype', 'follow-up', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'health record', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplasm registry', 'neoplasm resource', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'population based', 'recruit', 'repository', 'residence', 'response', 'statistics', 'symptom treatment', 'text searching', 'tool', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web page', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,P30,2018,149955,0.0673623647185105
"Precision Medicine by Targeting Cell Adhesion in Melanoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the proposed research, we address a problem that is common not just to melanoma, but also to other forms of cancer, such as prostate cancer, and that has been widely discussed recently. While we as dermatologists encourage patients to undergo skin cancer screening exams to detect melanoma early, it remains challenging to differentiate the truly aggressive from the indolent or nonclinical pigmented lesions. This is true even after a melanoma has been biopsied and examined under the microscope. As a result, there is massive over-diagnosis and overtreatment, specifically with respect to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies, that is costly, has side effects, requires precious hospital infrastructure and induces substantial patient anxiety. Surprisingly, and despite decades of research on cancer, assessment of metastasis risk in primary cutaneous melanoma continues to be based primarily on tumor invasion depth (also referred to Breslow depth), a method that was introduced 45 years go. While Breslow depth tends to work well at the extreme ends of the spectrum, most melanomas fall into a grey zone where Breslow depth with or without additional tissue-derived and clinical variables (such as patient age) does not predict the true biology of melanoma well. Breslow depth continues to be popular because alternative methods, including molecular-based methods, are either ineffective, have not been appropriately validated or lack a strong biological rationale. This in turn inhibits the development of new and innovative therapies. Here we will study a method that quantifies changes in integrin-linked cell adhesion to better differentiate high-risk (defined as SLN positive melanoma) from biologically indolent melanoma. First, we will study consecutive cases of cutaneous melanoma from across the United States and Europe and correlate a molecular profile of cell adhesion with SLN status. Second, we will study how the inhibition of certain aspects of integrin adhesion affects melanoma growth and metastasis in vivo. We expect that our research will validate methods to identify high-risk melanoma that outperform the standard of care, reduce the rate of unnecessary SLN procedures and identify patients with high-risk melanoma overlooked by current procedures. Moreover, a better understanding of the molecular machinery that drives metastasis will create new therapeutic opportunities. The candidate’s long term goal is discover novel characteristics of malignant melanocytes that enable the development of new and innovative diagnostic methods and therapies. The mentored career development award will help the candidate acquire new methodological, professional and leadership skills to independently, successfully and meaningfully contribute to the fields of cell adhesion/cancer/melanoma research in the years to come. Specifically, the plan is to pursue the following training activities: 1.) Acquire expertise in studying melanoma using mouse models; use these models to test and optimize drugs and drugs combinations. 2.) Acquire experience in interpreting the histological features of melanoma; broaden my understanding of the biological concepts used by dermatopathologists to characterize melanoma. 3.) Acquire expertise in designing diagnostic biomarker studies; learn statistical methods, specifically methods that can be used to analyze complex datasets. 4.) Build the professional and leadership skills to bring together and lead an international consortium of melanoma investigators. The candidate will be mentored by a team of national experts in the field of cancer research. Mentoring and research will be carried out at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. Mayo Clinic offers core facility services for all mainstream standardized biomedical research methods. This includes tissue archives and bio-banking, animal housing and animal care, optical imaging, including high-end confocal microscopes, all methods related to histology, including RNA and DNA in-situ hybridization, targeted gene expression-based methods including microfluidic Fluidigm technology, and all mainstream ‘omics’ methods. All services are fully staffed with trained technicians. Moreover, there is scientific staff available to trouble-shoot experiments. These resources are all within walking distance from the candidate’s laboratory. Moreover, Mayo Clinic has a large staff of medical indexers, software programmers, application specialist and bio-information scientists.

"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9534547,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2018,752888,-0.0007502007666792748
"Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics No abstract available NARRATIVE MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt) RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate levels of gene products, including proteins that are drug targets in cancer.

"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9512832,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,608223,-0.03455432660644354

"Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Modern digital pathology departments produce a tremendous amount of whole slide image data, which is quickly growing to petabyte scale. This plethora of data presents an unprecedented treasure chest for all kinds of medical machine learning tasks, including improvements in precision medicine.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of digital slides are not annotated on the image level, so histological points of interest are not integrated with the clinical notes or genetics associated with a patient. In contrast to other disciplines, manual labeling is not only cumbersome and time-consuming, but given the decades-long training of a pathologist, it is exorbitantly expensive and, due to clinical time constraints, impractical. Moreover, the time- dependent relationship between a patient's histology and genotype is not quantitatively leveraged to recommend combination therapies. Genetics informs us of important driver mutations, but how multiple cell types interact with these mutants over time in the tumor microenvironment to become histologically evident is less clear.  Deep learning synthesizes generations of pathologist knowledge as accurate quantitative models. Given a picture of a patient's morphology, I provide a tool that in four seconds finds the top ten most similar patients with their diagnoses, to support a pathologist's diagnosis decisions under the time pressures of active surgery. Recording the pathologist inspecting a slide at the microscope automatically annotates observed slide regions with time. Not only amenable for learning models that predict whether or not a region is salient to a pathologist making a diagnosis, this also allows all slides in a hospital to be annotated to identical criteria with only a representative sample of slides. I have submitted a manuscript reporting 85.15% accuracy in this saliency pre- diction task. This annotation greatly simplifies machine learning tasks, which can now focus on a non-redundant set of diagnostic regions in the slide, whether the application is to (a) find similar patients by morphology for diagnosis or (b) relate diagnostic morphology to the genetics.  Statistically modeling the relationship of the genotype to the histological phenotype in cancer opens promising new avenues in precision medicine. Taking a Big Data approach, I will leverage over 18,244 paired genome-histology samples to learn this model, using transfer learning techniques to maximize the value of all 18,244 samples for each tissue type. Genotype-phenotype model in hand, I will simulate the molecular clock in cancer, incrementally mutating the genome and predicting corresponding histology at each molecular time step. Through similar Q-learning that powers Google's champion artificial intelligence ``AlphaGo'', I will learn an agent that inhibits expression of a small set of mutant genes to maximize cancer progression-free survival time, by molecular time in the simulator. This not only measures the therapy's evolutionary durability, but also leads directly to experimentally testable hypotheses in 3D cell culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Digitized whole slide images of cancer tissue are a ``dark matter'' in the clinic, data that are often collected but rarely used quantitatively to model cancer or personalize medicine. I will, through close collaborations with practicing pathologists at globally leading cancer research hospitals, form statistical models of the histology evident in whole slides to (i) create clinical decision support tools that find similar patients by morphology alone to disambiguate cases that are difficult for a pathologist to diagnose under the time pressures of ongoing surgery, (ii) create a tool that learns which parts of a whole slide image are salient for a pathologist at the microscope to make a diagnosis, which greatly facilitates the deep learning techniques underlying [i] and [iii] by discarding redundant histological image data, and (iii) create a system that relates genotype to histological phenotype in cancer and learns an agent which leverages this system to determine the optimal multistage combination therapy to drive the histology towards health such that cancer progression-free survival time is maximized in the patient of interest. In this way, my statistical models will transform the vast dark matter of diagnosed histology data, representing generations of pathologist knowledge at these leading hospitals, into an indispensable resource for surgery, pathology, genetics, and precision medicine.","Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization.",9258847,F31CA214029,"['Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'CDH1 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Cells', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Drug Combinations', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'FGFR3 gene', 'Farming environment', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Medicine', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Second Opinions', 'Slide', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer imaging', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'dark matter', 'digital', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'improved', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mutant', 'overexpression', 'personalized medicine', 'petabyte', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'support tools', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F31,2017,44044,0.04308867222456179
"Integrative approach for predicting cancer driver genes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Carcinogenesis, progression of normal cells to malignant cancer, derives from hallmark capabilities of cancer driven by acquiring (somatic) mutations in ""driver genes"" with a selective advantage for cellular proliferation and potentially metastasis. A major motivation for modern cancer genomics studies is to decipher the genetic architecture of cancer by discovering new driver genes. The most widely-used approaches to predict and prioritize driver genes are based on statistics of mutation frequencies. Several methods have been proposed to identify genes with an excessive number of somatic mutations [9-11], known as significantly mutated genes. I propose to address two major limitations of this approach. First, these methods are insufficiently statistically powered given the amount of sequencing data currently available [15]. I will improve statistical power by leveraging diverse information in cancer genomics currently available into a developed machine learning method. Second, there is little objective clarity about the true effectiveness of these methods [11, 14], since there is no agreed-upon gold standard of driver genes, with the exception of a few well-known drivers. I will develop a framework to compare the effectiveness of driver gene prediction methods, in the absence of a gold standard. Both effectively and efficiently identifying cancer driver genes is a matter of great importance to science funding policy towards cancer genomics. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large sequencing studies have revolutionized our capability to identify the genetic architecture of cancer. However, effectively integrating this stream of big data to identify specific driver genes has remained troublesome. My proposed research project aims to develop an integrative machine learning method that leverages diverse features in cancer genomics to improve predictions of cancer driver genes, and to utilize a principled approach for evaluating the performance of any such method.",Integrative approach for predicting cancer driver genes,9322626,F31CA200266,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Normal Cell', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Property', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'carcinogenesis', 'compare effectiveness', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'transcriptome']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.047530070111719884
"Using Big Data to Estimate the Effects of Complex Cost-Sharing Rules on Colorectal Cancer Screening and Patient Health Colorectal cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality and approximately 5% of individuals will develop colorectal cancer during their lifetimes. However, colorectal cancer is highly preventable if detected early. Colonoscopies are the most common form of colorectal cancer screenings and all adults between the ages of 50 and 74 are recommended to receive a colonoscopy at least once every 10 years. This study will examine how two recent policies, coverage mandates and high-deductible health plans, that change consumer cost-sharing for colonoscopies have changed patient adherence to these guidelines among the commercially insured population. This study will also examine how changes in patient utilization of colonoscopies have led to changes in colorectal cancer detection and mortality. These policies have created a rapidly changing cost- sharing environment for patients and so fully understanding the patient health effects of these policies is will help inform policy makers on the patient health effects of these changes. Recent years have also seen a rapid increase in data, computing power, and analytical methodologies. This study will apply recent advances in data mining techniques to one of the largest sources of data available to researchers. The machine learning approaches used in this study will two sources of bias that are potentially present in traditional approaches—multiple hypothesis testing and selective reporting of results. The machine learning model approaches will also be used to estimate heterogeneity in treatment effects, which will help inform policy makers of how to tailor cost-sharing policies for colonoscopy services. Several recent policies have substantially changed consumer cost-sharing for screening colonoscopy services, which are highly effective in detecting and preventing colorectal cancer, among the commercially insured population. Very little is known about if this rapidly changing environment changes the utilization of preventive cancer screening.

"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism.

"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer. This mission will be realized through analysis, integration and visualization of multi-omic datasets including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data collected from patient samples to develop predictive models, and during drug treatment of patient derived xenografts and cell lines to validate mechanisms.",Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation,9353354,U24CA210972,"['Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Signal Pathway', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'assay development', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'candidate marker', 'clinical development', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'protein metabolite', 'proteogenomics', 'response', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U24,2017,624613,0.06418368382926673
"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9147605,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'molecular imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'response biomarker', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,188952,0.04765487375809762
"Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bioconductor PROJECT SUMMARY  The Bioconductor project is rooted in recognition that efﬁcient, rigorous, and reproducible analysis of high- dimensional data can be achieved when statisticians, biologists, and computer scientists federate efforts in a transparent and carefully engineered way. The project Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bio- conductor devises new approaches to carrying out genome-scale analysis of cancer data using cloud computing environments. The proposal is based on strategies that have proven highly effective in ﬁfteen years of supporting collaborative and carefully engineered software for genome scale analysis in computational biology in the Biocon- ductor project, based on the highly portable and widely adopted R language and environment for data analysis. In Aim 1 we develop architecture and infrastructure for scalably harvesting cloud-based representations of large- scale cancer genome studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, creating formal high-performance workﬂows for processing and interpreting cancer genome analyses, and providing packaging and data distribution schemes for moving data to the cloud for scalable analysis there. In Aim 2 we create and support independent creation of intuitive and cancer-relevant interface components supporting reproducible interactive exploration and analysis using the facilities of Rstudio. In Aim 3 we update and generalize the Bioconductor MLInterfaces metapackage to support advanced machine learning using the cancer-oriented strategies and facilities devised in Aims 1 and 2. Our proposal will beneﬁt large numbers of cancer researchers who will be taking advantage of cloud resources, probably with R close to hand, by marrying strengths of cloud-centric strategies for data archiving and query resolution, to the strengths of Bioconductor development and analysis capabilities. We have letters of support from the leadership of the three NCI Cancer Cloud Pilot projects for this project. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite major advances in elucidating mechanisms of tumor initiation and proliferation, treatment strategies for many cancers are ineffective, and patient-to-patient variation in treatment response suggests that personal targeting of cancer based on tumor molecular proﬁles will be necessary. This proposal takes a design and architecture approach from a widely used project for analyzing general data arising in genome-scale biology, and adapts it to new NCI-supported cloud-based data archives and analysis environments. The proposal will accelerate identiﬁcation of sources of variation of tumor responsiveness to treatment and will aid physicians in devising personalized antitumor strategies.",Accelerating Cancer Genomics with Cloud-scale Bioconductor,9295396,U01CA214846,"['Acceleration', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Animal Cancer Model', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioconductor', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Development', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Harvest', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Leadership', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Motivation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Published Comment', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'actionable mutation', 'analytical method', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer type', 'cloud based', 'computing resources', 'data archive', 'data format', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genome analysis', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomics cloud', 'high dimensionality', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prototype', 'response', 'software development', 'spelling', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor initiation', 'usability']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2017,458029,0.08727810257166625
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation. The research will establish  resources and software to contribute such methodologies for the Genome Data Analysis Network  projects that will subsequently be released into the public domain to benefit the entire scientific  community.",UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,9353344,U24CA210990,"['Alpha Cell', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North Carolina', 'Oncogenic', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Subtype', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'exceptional responders', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2017,452649,0.03126278821829813
"Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing. We will make our data, analysis methods and results readily available to a broad group of researchers within a cloud computing framework. NARRATIVE MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt) RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate levels of gene products, including proteins that are drug targets in cancer. In order to shift medical practice towards personalized treatments, the proposed research will apply innovative analysis methods to understand the role of miRNA expression on survival and drug response, within the context of DNA, RNA and protein data generated in a large research network. This will help identify cancer subtypes, and individual patient phenotypes, in which alterations in miRNA expression can lead to particular cancer progression pathways and treatment responses, in order to inform disease management.",Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics,9352805,U24CA210952,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biogenesis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Targeting', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Sequences', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'flexibility', 'gene product', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor progression', 'working group']",NCI,BRITISH COLUMBIA CANCER AGENCY,U24,2017,398402,0.07327143489661185
"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer. The development of new technologies that provide unique chemical specific information will enable improved diagnostic assays for the treatment of cancer. Relevance to Public Health. The proposed research seeks to develop new technology for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Cancer exhibits misregulation of metabolic process relative to normal cells.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9349466,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,542768,0.06555928280115578
"An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA PROJECT SUMMARY Recent studies revealed that the human genome encodes thousands of lncRNAs with little proteincoding capacity. LncRNAs were shown to play important roles in cancer and are potentially a new class of therapeutic targets for cancer. However, the function of the vast majority of lncRNAs in cancer remains unknown. LncRNA function often depends on its physical interactions with protein complexes. They can also influence the abundance of other mRNAs that are targeted by the same microRNAs by competing for microRNA binding, i.e., serving as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Advances in genomic technologies, especially those based on next generation sequencing (NGS), provide unparalleled opportunities to characterize the functional networks of lncRNA in cancer. However, analysis and integration of different types of genomic datasets to generate testable hypotheses is challenging, and systematic approaches to characterize lncRNA function in cancer are lacking. This application describes the development of computational methods and integrative genomic strategies for systematically dissecting the functional network of lncRNA in cancer, and a combination of computational and experimental approaches to unravel several important functional networks of lncRNA in prostate cancer. Specifically, it will (1) develop a computational method for repurposing the publically available array-based data to interrogate lncRNA expression in tumor samples and utilize an integrative genomic strategy to predict lncRNAs that may be important for tumorigenesis/tumor suppression in prostate cancer via analysis of lncRNA expression profiles, clinical information and somatic genomic alteration profiles of tumor samples, (2) identify the lncRNAs that are associated with EZH2 or direct transcriptional targets of EZH2 repression that are important for prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression, and (3) identify the ceRNAs of AR and PTEN that mediate prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression. In addition to its scientific proposal, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in the fields of computational genomics, noncoding RNA and cancer, who develops cutting-edge computational methods, and uses a combination of computational and experimental approaches to understand structure-function relationship of noncoding RNA and the function of noncoding RNA and RNA-protein interaction in cancer. While the candidate of this application has received extensive training in biophysics, statistics, machine learning and computational genomics, this career development award will allow him to develop his experimental skills, especially those next-generation sequencing-based techniques and molecular biology experiments in human cell lines. Dr. Liu, Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Dr. Brown, Professor of Medicine will mentor the candidate in the excellent training environment of Dana Farber Cancer Institute, a part of Harvard Medical School community. A committee of experienced computational and cancer biologists will also advise him on both scientific research and career development. The proposed study is to decipher lncRNA function in cancer using a combination of novel computational methods and high-throughput experimental technologies. The proposed research will result in publically available bioinformatic resources for studying lncRNA function in cancer, a greater understanding of IncRNA function in prostate cancer, and will help to discover novel therapeutic target of lncRNA for treating prostate cancer.",An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA,9207429,R00CA175290,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Biophysics', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Exons', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTEN gene', 'Play', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'RNA', 'RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'career development', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'mRNA Expression', 'medical schools', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'professor', 'prostate carcinogenesis', 'protein complex', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R00,2017,221939,-0.020785621731549027
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance. The Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC) will develop quantitative approaches to understand, study and find potential novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of solid tumors.        Average Scores of the Components:    Overall:			2.7    Project 1:			2.7    Project 2:			2.3    Project 3:			4.3    Resource Core 1:		2.2    Education and Outreach:	2.9            ",Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity,9263901,U54CA193313,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug resistance', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Institution', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'New York', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bcr-abl Fusion Proteins', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'genomic profiles', 'high dimensionality', 'imprint', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'leukemia', 'mathematical methods', 'metropolitan', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'physical science', 'pressure', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single cell sequencing', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2017,2087754,0.059647285696624426
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. We propose to develop a novel personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with extremely high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant culture, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices, and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The integration of a machine-learning algorithm will further provide precise and unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor ecosystem.",Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems,9392396,U01CA214411,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Autologous', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomimetics', 'Biopsy', 'Bioreactors', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cetuximab', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Combinations', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glucose', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hydrogels', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Microfluidics', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nature', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Regimen', 'Rest', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Cost', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Derived', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'cytokine', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'fluid flow', 'genetic profiling', 'humanized mouse', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'protein B', 'response', 'survival outcome', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2017,653695,0.018611687541540634
"Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing Project Summary/Abstract Clinical data collection is accelerating rapidly, and in the future it will include both provider- and patient- generated data. Hidden within this mass of noisy observational data are clues as to factors influencing disease onset and outcome. Finding ways to exploit this trove of disease data can unlock a new perspective on disease processes. We can tackle disease both from the bottom-up, from experimental data generated in the laboratory, and from the top down, from clinical phenomena observed across human populations. A particularly impactful and prevalent disease is cancer. Each tumor harbors a unique combination of mutations driving a distinct set of oncogenic processes. Targeted therapies have been proposed to pinpoint these mutations, potentially requiring a vast array of therapeutic options. Cancer treatment often fails when drug resistance arises, another result of the complex combinatorial nature of tumor alterations. Combination therapies have been proposed as an approach to interfere with multiple disease signals simultaneously. However, identifying effective drug combinations, and the cancer types in which they are effective, is experimentally infeasible, leading to a push for computational solutions. In this proposal, we combine methods from social sciences and biostatistics to find the causal effect of a drug on cancer onset from observational clinical data. Both increased and decreased cancer rates in drug-takers are of equal interest, as they can inform us of disease processes and provide clinical impact. We are particularly interested in finding drug combinations that impact cancer. These combination effects are unlikely to have been detected, and our clinical data provides a unique resource for observing the effects of tens of thousands of drug combinations. We will pool the resulting causal drug effect estimates across the many cancers present in our data. To gain insight into the cellular processes underlying clinical effect, we will examine the impact of known cancer-causing drugs in vitro, using large public cell line assays. The accompanying goal is to provide Dr. Rachel Melamed with a career development experience to become an independent scientist. Her research will use observational health data to understand the genesis of cancer, prevent the disease, and discover new therapeutic options. This proposal takes advantage of the interdisciplinary strengths of the University of Chicago in computation, biostatistics, and medicine, as well as institutional resources in terms of data access and infrastructure. Dr. Melamed has assembled a team consisting of complementary mentors and collaborators with expertise in computation, statistics, translational medicine, personalized therapy, and cancer therapy. The career development plan focuses on enhancing her statistics and machine learning skills with structured coursework and mentorship, and gaining experience in biomedical applications via applied work and mentorship. This will provide Dr. Melamed with skills to model observational data and to integrate the results with experimental data. Project Narrative Clinical data has been shown to hold patterns relating drugs to cancer onset. Using this data to find drugs that increase cancer rates will provide insight into the disease and an opportunity for preventing some cancer cases. Discovery of drugs, and particularly drug combinations, that reduce cancer rates could suggest low-cost new therapeutic options.",Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing,9324540,K01ES028055,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Case Series', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Finding by Cause', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Skill', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Premalignant', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career development', 'clinical effect', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data access', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'life history', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'training opportunity', 'translational medicine', 'tumor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2017,124953,0.05142677019488783
"Hardwiring Mechanism into Predicting Cancer Phenotypes by Computational Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Few biomarkers derived from genome scale data have translated into improved clinical classification of cancer subtypes, in spite of the wealth of available genome-wide studies and of the corresponding application of numerous statistical algorithms. This widespread shortcoming derives from the pervasive use of ""off the shelf"" algorithms and machine learning techniques developed for image classification and language processing, which are naïve of the underlying biology of the system. Furthermore, for genome-wide data, the number of samples is often small relative to the number of potential candidate biomarkers, resulting in variable accuracy on independent test data despite high accuracy in the samples used for discovery, which contributes to the failure of clinical biomarkers. This problem - so called ""curse of dimensionality"" - is further exacerbated by the prohibitive cost of dramatically increasing sample size and by patient stratification into smaller subgroups for personalized and precision medicine. Disease phenotypes arise from distinct and specific perturbations in selected networks and pathways defined by the interactions of their molecular constituents. In cancer, these perturbations may reside in gene regulatory networks topology and state, in cell signaling activity, or in metabolic conditions. We hypothesize that by leveragin such prior biological information on cancer biology we will be able to reduce model complexity and build mechanistically justified predictive models. To pursue this hypothesis, we will develop an analytical framework to embed mechanistic constraints derived from network biology into the statistical learning process itself. Hence, this application will develop a novel suite of statistial learning algorithms that embed (Aim 1) gene expression regulatory networks, (Aim 2) cell signaling activity, and (Aim 3) metabolism to classify breast and prostate cancer. Throughout the study we will work closely with clinical collaborators to ensure that our method improve over and above current predictive and prognostic models. Finally, since in our study we will also generate mechanistic classifiers based on gene expression measurements obtained from clinical assays that are already commercially available (i.e., MammaPrint®, and Decipher®), our innovative models and predictors will be also readily available for clinical translation. Our mechanism-driven classifiers will simultaneously have greater accuracy and interpretability than classifiers developed without regard for the underlying biology of the disease. Furthermore, embedding biological mechanisms in the classifiers will also facilitate the identification of alternative therapeutic targets specific to each cancer subtype, potentially improving patient prognosis and health outcomes. Finally, the substantial curation of molecular pathways and biological networks we will carry on in the project will also provide a powerful resource for futur studies, and the methodologies we will develop will be also applicable to other cancer and other human diseases, like neurodegenerative disorders, hearth disease, and diabetes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative This study will use mechanistic biological knowledge to implement a suite of statistical algorithms for cancer patient classification, which will also reveal the biological reasoning behind the classification decision rules. In the study we will also apply our novel methods to develop improved biomarkers for breast and prostate cancer patient clinical stratification, with the ultimate goal of facilitating the selection of appropriate treatment. To achieve this goal we will directly improve the existing commercial tests offered to the patients, with an immediate clinical impact, since our biomarkers will be directly implementable into these assays, with the potential to quickly reach the bedside.",Hardwiring Mechanism into Predicting Cancer Phenotypes by Computational Learning,9253361,R01CA200859,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Models', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker development', 'cancer cell', 'cancer classification', 'cancer subtypes', 'candidate marker', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'feeding', 'functional group', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized health care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,384981,0.020420584775503965
"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,9323323,P50CA121973,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Antigens', 'Apoptotic', 'BRAF gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cell Vaccine', 'Dermatologic', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunology procedure', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interferon Alfa-2b', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Program Development', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specialized Program of Research Excellence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute', 'Unresectable', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career development', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'data management', 'design', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'melanoma', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel vaccines', 'oncology', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P50,2017,2350000,0.03268386148222658
"Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer genomics resources are growing at an unprecedented pace. However, a comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome still remains a daunting challenge. This is in part due to the difficulties in visualizing, integrating, and analyzng cancer genomics data with current technologies. We propose to develop a cloud-based platform to empower researchers with the ability to host, visualize and analyze their own data. The platform is composed of a set of Cancer Analytics Virtual Machines (CAVMs). The main component of each CAVM is a data server which functions to store and serve user data to applications, such as the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, to provide data visualization. The second component is a modified Galaxy workflow system to provide data analysis capability. UCSC's suite of analysis tools for nextgen sequencing data analysis and pathway inference will be prepackaged with the system. The two components will be highly integrated to allow tightly coupled cycles of data visualization and analysis. The data server component will be modular such that it can provide data independently to applications besides the Cancer Browser and Galaxy. We will deliver virtual machine images that can be easily initiated in a commercial cloud such as Amazon, or can be installed within a user's own institution. The CAVM also functions as a way for users to Integrate with external large-scale databases. We will deliver a UCSC CAVM that other CAVM instances can connect to, to provide authorized data access from the UCSC cancer genomics data repository. The system allows the dynamic formation of new datasets composed of data slices from multiple sources. This ability to combine data into larger samples will provide the statistical power to allow discoveries that would otherwise not be possible. We aim to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the overhead of system configuration and software installation. Our tools will provide users the capability to access a cloud-based cluster computing environment, which will make sophisticated, computationally intensive analyses accessible to researchers who might not, have access to compute servers. The software platform we develop can be used by individual bench biologists, and also by large projects to serve data to individual users or to other projects. This design has the potential to form an expansive federated database accessible through the same software interface.         RELEVANCE: Currently, clinicians and bench biologists typically depend on external collaborators for data analysis. The proposed system will provide these scientists with data analysis and visualization methods that are both powerful and easy to use.

"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.

Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9381186,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,362188,0.08319136063746524
"Characterization of Thyroid Nodules by Quantitative Ultrasound Project Summary Thyroid cancer is the most-common endocrine malignancy. Its incidence has tripled in the last thirty years. Diagnosis of thyroid cancer is difficult because 50% of people older than 65 have at least 1 thyroid nodule, but only 10% of the nodules are cancerous. Approximately 1.6 billion dollars are spent annually in the US to detect thyroid cancer. Conventional ultrasound is used to identify nodules that warrant a needle biopsy. However, 65% of needle biopsies are negative for cancer and 30% are “indeterminate.” The indeterminate nodules are surgically removed for definitive diagnosis and 75% of them prove to be benign. Therefore, well more than 80% of initially presenting nodules undergo unnecessary biopsies and more than 20% of them also undergo subsequent unnecessary surgery procedures. Accordingly, the broad objective of the proposed study is to assess the feasibility of using quantitative-ultrasound (QUS) methods to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules reliably and thereby to reduce the enormous cost and risks associated with unnecessary biopsies and surgical excisions. The first aim of the project is to develop and asses the ability of QUS to distinguish cancerous from benign nodules and to compare the ability of QUS to the ability of conventional methods to select nodules that warrant biopsies; the second aim is to expand QUS methods by combining existing QUS measures developed by Riverside Research with measures derived from so-called B-flow- imaging (BFI) and shear-wave-elasticity (SWE) techniques developed by GE; the third aim is to formulate an objective basis for planning future, prospective studies to translate the findings of the present study to a commercial instrument that can bring QUS-based nodule evaluation into the clinic. To achieve these three aims, QUS performance in classifying cancerous and benign nodules will be compared to the performance of conventional ultrasound and the results of fine needle cytology, molecular marker analyses, and, in the cases of that undergo surgical excision, histology, will used as gold standards. Classification will be performed using standard, well understood, linear, and non-linear methods, such as linear-discriminant analysis and support- vector machines respectively. If feasibility is successfully demonstrated in the proposed project, and if the demonstration of feasibility ultimately leads to future incorporation into an instrument capable of real-time QUS analysis for reliable nodule evaluation, then a highly significant technological advance will be realized that can provide valuable, risk-reducing, cost-effective health-care benefits for patients presenting with thyroid nodules.   PROJECT NARRATIVE: Thyroid cancer rates have tripled in the last thirty years, but current methods of diagnosis are very inefficient. Far too many thyroid biopsies and surgeries are performed with >80% of biopsies and >25% of thyroid surgeries being performed on benign nodules. The advanced ultrasound methods to be evaluated in this proposal seek to drastically reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies and surgeries of benign thyroid nodules.",Characterization of Thyroid Nodules by Quantitative Ultrasound,9224641,R21CA212744,"['Achievement', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Asses', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Microcalcification', 'Calcified', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancerous', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cytology', 'Cytology Histology', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Elasticity', 'Endocrine', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fine-needle biopsy', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prostate', 'ROC Curve', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Thyroid Nodule', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'base', 'calcification', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'elastography', 'improved', 'instrument', 'lymph nodes', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'statistics']",NCI,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2017,274504,-0.00023924959464234226
"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale DCM: DA: ESCE: Discovering Molecular Processes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disease of the genome, caused by disruptions in a person's DNA. Orders of magnitude decreases in price and increases in sequencing throughput enabled sequencing of hundreds of genomes. This will launch a new phase bf ""Precision Medicine,"" where molecular markers can guide therapies tailored to patients. The genomics revolution is now systematically characterizing every somatic change in every tumor for large cohorts (>300 patients). Despite some successes, predicting cancer outcomes based on molecular signatures remains a major challenge. This proposal aims at obliterating several key roadblocks stymieing progress. First, the raw sequence data is not particularly well-suited for use in developing predictive models. Therefore, gene- and pathway-level evidence will be derived from CGHub to significantly increase the utility of the information for biomedical discovery. The information will be collected in a Social Graph technology framework like Facebook to scale to billions of interconnected objects called the Biomedical Evidence Graph (BMEG). Second, the datasets are so large they are impractical to move around on the internet. Thus, an environment will be created within which researchers can move their code to the vast amounts of data within the BMEG. Third, prediction challenges will be created based on cancer genomics datasets and patient outcomes. While there have been a few successes in predicting outcomes, current approaches suffer from reproducibility and robustness when applied to unseen data. This activity will reach a broad community of algorithm developers, promote transparency and sharing of bioinformatics code, and create a strong network effect to crowd-source the development of the best models for biological discovery. The system constructed will be focused around the investigation of cancer outcomes but the entire pipeline will be of general utility for any number of genome-based projects including investigating any number of disease, stem cell properties, model organisms, and genome-wide association studies. RELEVANCE (See instructions): While we are accumulating vast amounts of information on cancer cells, we are still searching in the dark for clues about predicting treatment strategies. It is of paramount importance to accelerate computational discovery. The creation of the BMEG will catalyze community participation to uncover novel relationships to elucidate new fundamental biology on oncogenesis and therapeutic directions for treating this disease. n/a",BIGDATA: Mid-Scale DCM: DA: ESCE: Discovering Molecular Processes,9292292,R01CA180778,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Back', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Participation', 'DNA', 'Darkness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Level of Evidence', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Price', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Stem cells', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'crowdsourcing', 'data management', 'e-science', 'genome wide association study', 'molecular marker', 'new technology', 'novel', 'online resource', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R01,2017,643668,0.05355275195095371
"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",9350715,U54CA209988,"['Cancer Control', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational Materials', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Vitro', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'MDA-MB-468', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'SDZ RAD', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'analytical tool', 'bioimaging', 'bioprinting', 'cancer cell', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data management', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2017,1876979,0.02621258926876714
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling.

"Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers PROJECT SUMMARY As a computational biologist, my long-term goal is to develop methods and tools to discover new or better therapeutics for cancers. In the past few years, I have identified drug-repositioning candidates for a number of primary cancers using Big Data approaches. These candidates have been validated successfully in preclinical mouse models. To maximize the utility of Big Data, I plan to translate the findings into therapeutics; therefore, I propose to develop methods to utilize transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers. Current preclinical and clinical approaches including the NCI MATCH trial select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations, yet patients may have no actionable mutations or multiple actionable mutations that are hard to prioritize, suggesting the need for other different types of molecular biomarkers. The recent efforts have enabled the large-scale identification of various types of molecular biomarkers through correlating drug sensitivity with molecular profiles of pre-treatment cancer cell lines. Computational methods to match these biomarkers to individual patients to inform therapy in the clinic are thus in high demand. The objective of this award is therefore to develop computational approaches to identify therapeutics for individual patients by leveraging large-scale biomarkers identified from cancer cell lines. Through conducing this research, I expect to expand my knowledge in cancer clinical trials, cancer genomics, cancer biology, and statistics. To achieve the goal, I have gathered seven renowned experts from different fields related to Big Data Science as mentors/advisors/collaborators: Primary Mentor Dr. Atul Butte in translational bioinformatics from UCSF, Co-mentor Dr. Samuel So in cancer biology from Stanford University, Co-mentor Dr. Mark Segal in statistics from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Andrei Goga in cancer biology from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Laura Esserman in breast cancer trials from UCSF, Collaborator Dr. John Gordan in liver cancer trials from UCSF and Collaborator Dr. Xin Chen in cancer biology from UCSF. With the support from my world- class mentors, advisors and collaborators, this award will prepare me to be a leader in developing big data methods that are broadly impactful. PROJECT NARRATIVE One goal of the precision medicine initiative is to select optimal therapies for individual cancer patients based on their molecular and clinical profiles. Current preclinical and clinical approaches select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations. This work is expected to employ the protein/gene expression based biomarkers computed from public databases to inform individualized cancer therapy.","Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers",9324471,K01ES028047,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Alpha Cell', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Award', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Non-Malignant', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'data sharing', 'drug candidate', 'drug efficacy', 'drug sensitivity', 'efficacy testing', 'genetic signature', 'individual patient', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'protein expression', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2017,171216,0.05114630385058626

"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9292041,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2017,347700,-0.0021086688187394783
"Evaluation of dynamic strategies of cancer care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In making the most important decisions for cancer care, clinicians naturally consider their patients' evolving characteristics and risks factors and tailor the treatments or diagnostic tests accordingly. In other words, they consider dynamic treatment strategies that depend on the evolution of one or more time-dependent covariates (e.g. functional status, frailty, new comorbidities) as opposed to static treatment strategies which do not. Despite the clinical relevance of dynamic treatment strategies, most research continues to compare static strategies. This is because, in part, randomized clinical trials comparing dynamic strategies can be particularly expensive, time-consuming, and inefficient. Additionally, observational studies of dynamic strategies require specific methods because even in the absence of unmeasured confounding, conventional estimates fail to have a causal interpretation when (i) there exists a measured time-varying prognostic factor that also predicts subsequent treatment, and (ii) past treatment predicts subsequent prognostic factor level. This treatment- confounder feedback is pervasive in biomedical research. This application's broad objective is to create an innovative research program that integrates data from diverse sources such as electronic medical records, administrative claims, epidemiologic cohorts (and in the future wearable health technology and patient portals) with advanced epidemiological methods to study dynamic strategies of health care delivery and create publicly available analytic tools to accelerate discovery and support a more strategic delivery of cancer care. The specific aims involve training in open-source programming, data science and advanced epidemiological methods. These skills will be used to develop three projects that will use different sources of data (a traditional epidemiological cohort, a linkage of tumor registries with claims and electronic medical records) to address questions on prevention, surveillance and treatment of cancer:  • What is the best dynamic strategy for colorectal cancer screening?  • What is the best dynamic strategy for bladder cancer surveillance?  • What is the best dynamic strategy of treatment for prostate cancer patients with a PSA-only relapse? These projects will serve as a backbone to develop and fine tune the specific methods required to study dynamic strategies of health care delivery: the g-methods. Specifically, this application will focus on the application and dissemination of Marginal Structural Models and the parametric g-formula for clinical cancer research. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposal addresses the systematic application and dissemination of cutting-edge methods (g- methods) for causal inference to clinical cancer research using complex sources of data. G-methods are particularly useful for answering clinical questions where treatments, patient characteristics and outcomes change over time (which is virtually always the case). By tailoring these methods to cancer research and developing open-source analytic platforms, we plan to spread their use across the scientific community and ultimately benefit patient care.",Evaluation of dynamic strategies of cancer care,9314154,K99CA207730,"['Address', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Androgens', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Observational Study', 'Orphan', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance Status', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Site', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Vertebral column', 'academic program', 'administrative database', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'case-based', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'neoplastic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'relational database', 'response', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'sound', 'surveillance strategy', 'theories', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing', 'tumor', 'tumor registry', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2017,137137,0.02215389607184714
"Determinants of pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma phenotypes in CDKN2A hereditary kindreds This proposal addresses Provocative Question #2. We will use innovative approaches to investigate how CDKN2A (which encodes p16) mutation carriers develop different cancer phenotypes (pancreatic cancer vs melanoma vs no cancer), and include both genetic and non-genetic factors. We have identified 4 large, multi- generational kindreds with a founder CDKN2A deleterious mutation (L16R, 47T>G). Our preliminary observations demonstrate that this mutant has lower expression and decreased ability to regulate cell cycle progression compared to wild type protein. Our sequencing studies of kindred members with different cancer phenotypes have identified potential variants in novel genes that modify risk (LGR6, a co-receptor of Wnt signaling and COL11A1, which participates in oncogenic signaling, including TGFbeta). We will determine the ability of the p16 mutant to promote transformation and how it is influenced by interaction with the above candidate modifier genes, LGR6 or COL11A1, in pancreatic cancer and melanoma. We will also develop novel computational models using machine deep learning, to generate networks that capture high dimensional features to integrate gene, biology, and cancer phenotype. This approach will be extended to kindreds with other CDKN2A mutations. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify genotypes of potential modifier genes in multiple kindreds that feature pancreatic cancer and melanoma and known to carry CDKN2A germline mutations. We will use genome wide variant coverage of germline DNA from CDKN2A carriers from the 4 large L16R kindreds, plus additional members in 42 other similar CDKN2A kindreds. We will identify candidate modifier genes in the kindreds by rule-based statistical genetic analysis of genotypes. (2) Define the impact of CDKN2A L16R mutation on the function of p16 and its interplay with candidate modifier genes. We will elucidate the biological significance of mutations in CDKN2A and candidate modifier genes using functional and high throughput methodologies by analyzing the mechanism underlying the interplay between p16 and modifier genes; define new pathways cooperating with this interplay using a combination of genome wide studies to assess transformation in cells carrying p16 mutant or wild-type background using well established in vitro and in vivo models. (3) Develop a deep learning network model to integrate genetic, biological and epidemiological data to accurately infer pancreatic cancer and melanoma phenotypes and age of onset in mutation carriers. We will apply a convolutional neural network, a deep learning algorithm in the training dataset, develop a back-propagation algorithm to fine tune “weights,” and construct mutation-gene networks to capture high-dimensional features for each disease subclass. We will acquire and disseminate new knowledge and tools to the scientific community. Our integrated methods and approach will bring insight into how different cancer phenotypes can occur with identical predisposing mutations, which can be applied to other cancer syndromes with similar challenges.

"Precision Medicine by Targeting Cell Adhesion in Melanoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the proposed research, we address a problem that is common not just to melanoma, but also to other forms of cancer, such as prostate cancer, and that has been widely discussed recently. While we as dermatologists encourage patients to undergo skin cancer screening exams to detect melanoma early, it remains challenging to differentiate the truly aggressive from the indolent or nonclinical pigmented lesions. This is true even after a melanoma has been biopsied and examined under the microscope. As a result, there is massive over-diagnosis and overtreatment, specifically with respect to sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies, that is costly, has side effects, requires precious hospital infrastructure and induces substantial patient anxiety. Surprisingly, and despite decades of research on cancer, assessment of metastasis risk in primary cutaneous melanoma continues to be based primarily on tumor invasion depth (also referred to Breslow depth), a method that was introduced 45 years go. While Breslow depth tends to work well at the extreme ends of the spectrum, most melanomas fall into a grey zone where Breslow depth with or without additional tissue-derived and clinical variables (such as patient age) does not predict the true biology of melanoma well. Breslow depth continues to be popular because alternative methods, including molecular-based methods, are either ineffective, have not been appropriately validated or lack a strong biological rationale. This in turn inhibits the development of new and innovative therapies. Here we will study a method that quantifies changes in integrin-linked cell adhesion to better differentiate high-risk (defined as SLN positive melanoma) from biologically indolent melanoma. First, we will study consecutive cases of cutaneous melanoma from across the United States and Europe and correlate a molecular profile of cell adhesion with SLN status. Second, we will study how the inhibition of certain aspects of integrin adhesion affects melanoma growth and metastasis in vivo. We expect that our research will validate methods to identify high-risk melanoma that outperform the standard of care, reduce the rate of unnecessary SLN procedures and identify patients with high-risk melanoma overlooked by current procedures. Moreover, a better understanding of the molecular machinery that drives metastasis will create new therapeutic opportunities. The candidate’s long term goal is discover novel characteristics of malignant melanocytes that enable the development of new and innovative diagnostic methods and therapies. The mentored career development award will help the candidate acquire new methodological, professional and leadership skills to independently, successfully and meaningfully contribute to the fields of cell adhesion/cancer/melanoma research in the years to come. Specifically, the plan is to pursue the following training activities: 1.) Acquire expertise in studying melanoma using mouse models; use these models to test and optimize drugs and drugs combinations. 2.) Acquire experience in interpreting the histological features of melanoma; broaden my understanding of the biological concepts used by dermatopathologists to characterize melanoma. 3.) Acquire expertise in designing diagnostic biomarker studies; learn statistical methods, specifically methods that can be used to analyze complex datasets. 4.) Build the professional and leadership skills to bring together and lead an international consortium of melanoma investigators. The candidate will be mentored by a team of national experts in the field of cancer research. Mentoring and research will be carried out at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. Mayo Clinic offers core facility services for all mainstream standardized biomedical research methods. This includes tissue archives and bio-banking, animal housing and animal care, optical imaging, including high-end confocal microscopes, all methods related to histology, including RNA and DNA in-situ hybridization, targeted gene expression-based methods including microfluidic Fluidigm technology, and all mainstream ‘omics’ methods. All services are fully staffed with trained technicians. Moreover, there is scientific staff available to trouble-shoot experiments. These resources are all within walking distance from the candidate’s laboratory. Moreover, Mayo Clinic has a large staff of medical indexers, software programmers, application specialist and bio-information scientists. Because of the size of the clinic, there are medical specialists and subspecialists on hand for all areas of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE While dermatologists encourage patients to undergo skin cancer screening exams to detect melanoma early, it remains challenging to differentiate the truly aggressive from the indolent pigmented lesion.

"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9295773,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Community Healthcare', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2017,766250,-0.0007502007666792748
"Advanced Development of TIES-Enhancing Access to Tissue for Cancer Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Archived human tissues are an essential resource for translational research. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from cancer patients are used in a wide range of assays, including RT-PCR, SNP profiling, multiplex biomarkers, imaging biomarkers, targeted exome, whole exome, and whole genome sequencing. Remainder FFPE tissues generated during patient care are 'retrospective'; use of these tissues under specific conditions does not require consent. For personalized medicine researchers, these specimens are vital resources enabling biomarker validation, detailed molecular analysis, and systems modeling before application is made to individual patients. But access to these human tissues is often a rate limiting factor in cancer research. We propose advanced development of the TIES software to (1) increase institutional capacity for using FFPE to support molecular characterization of human tumors, (2) increase access to tissues within cancer centers, and (3) improve the ability to share tissues and associated phenotype data among cancer centers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This work proposes the development of a software system that will enhance the ability of cancer researchers to find and use human tissues and accompanying electronic data for scientific research.

"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9305968,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,624988,-0.03455432660644354

"Integrative approach for predicting cancer driver genes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Carcinogenesis, progression of normal cells to malignant cancer, derives from hallmark capabilities of cancer driven by acquiring (somatic) mutations in ""driver genes"" with a selective advantage for cellular proliferation and potentially metastasis. A major motivation for modern cancer genomics studies is to decipher the genetic architecture of cancer by discovering new driver genes. The most widely-used approaches to predict and prioritize driver genes are based on statistics of mutation frequencies. Several methods have been proposed to identify genes with an excessive number of somatic mutations [9-11], known as significantly mutated genes. I propose to address two major limitations of this approach. First, these methods are insufficiently statistically powered given the amount of sequencing data currently available [15]. I will improve statistical power by leveraging diverse information in cancer genomics currently available into a developed machine learning method. Second, there is little objective clarity about the true effectiveness of these methods [11, 14], since there is no agreed-upon gold standard of driver genes, with the exception of a few well-known drivers. I will develop a framework to compare the effectiveness of driver gene prediction methods, in the absence of a gold standard. Both effectively and efficiently identifying cancer driver genes is a matter of great importance to science funding policy towards cancer genomics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large sequencing studies have revolutionized our capability to identify the genetic architecture of cancer. However, effectively integrating this stream of big data to identify specific driver genes has remained troublesome. My proposed research project aims to develop an integrative machine learning method that leverages diverse features in cancer genomics to improve predictions of cancer driver genes, and to utilize a principled approach for evaluating the performance of any such method.            ",Integrative approach for predicting cancer driver genes,9152184,F31CA200266,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Normal Cell', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Property', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Bias', 'Stream', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'carcinogenesis', 'compare effectiveness', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'statistics', 'transcriptome']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,0.047530070111719884
"Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers Project Summary/Abstract Cancerous cells reprogram their metabolism to accommodate their needs. A deep understanding of this metabolic reprograming can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer treatment. Different human cancers differ with respect to aspects of their metabolic rewiring, however a profound knowledge in this field is lacking. The main goal of my thesis project is to characterize the ways in which one-carbon metabolism — a metabolic pathway highly altered in cancer— is utilized by different human cancers and elucidate its consequences on downstream processes such as epigenetics and biosynthesis. Using information in genomic profiles of individual tumors, I build computational models to infer metabolic landscapes, assess their implications in patient survival, and predict response to chemotherapy. By studying one-carbon metabolites in the human serum, I confirm the relevance of theses findings in human contexts and suggest potentials for dietary intervention approaches. In aim 1, I characterize the usage of serine through one-carbon metabolism across human cancers. I performed flux analysis using gene expression profiles of hundreds of human tumors, followed by experimental validation using metabolomics approaches. In aim 2, I identify the determinants of human serum methionine. Diet records, serum metabolomics, and clinical data from a cohort of human subjects were incorporated into computational models. The determinants of variability in serum methionine were then quantified, suggesting a mechanism for regulation of cellular epigenetics by the diet. In aim 3, I determine the sources of variation in DNA methylation across human cancers and the contribution of metabolism. I integrated molecular and clinical profiles of thousands of human tumors from the TCGA into machine-learning algorithms to identify their association with DNA methylation. A major contribution from one-carbon metabolism in regulating DNA methylation status in tumors was found. In aim 4, I predict response to anti-metabolic chemotherapies based on tumor genomics. I plan to translate my previous findings into clinical discoveries. To this end, I will demonstrate how tumor profiles can be used to model patient survival, predict response to chemotherapy, and move toward precision medicine. Narrative Alteration in cellular metabolism is one the hallmarks of cancer. This project aims to elucidate the consequences of these alterations in cancer and reveal how different human cancers differ with respect to their metabolism. Findings can lead to novel and promising routes toward cancer prevention and treatment such as precision medicine and dietary intervention.",Characterization of the functions of one-carbon metabolism across human cancers,9229841,F99CA212457,"['Algorithms', 'Anabolism', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Simulation', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fluorouracil', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Glycine', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methionine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pemetrexed', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Route', 'Serine', 'Serum', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cell growth regulation', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'epigenomics', 'experimental analysis', 'genomic profiles', 'human subject', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'tumor', 'tumor metabolism']",NCI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,F99,2016,32196,0.021082781120625484
"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data.  PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer. This mission will be realized through analysis, integration and visualization of multi-omic datasets including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data collected from patient samples to develop predictive models, and during drug treatment of patient derived xenografts and cell lines to validate mechanisms.",Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation,9210808,U24CA210972,"['Amino Acid Sequence Databases', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Family', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Phosphorylation', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Signal Pathway', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'assay development', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'protein metabolite', 'proteogenomics', 'research study', 'response', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U24,2016,659453,0.06418368382926673
"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing. We will make our data, analysis methods and results readily available to a broad group of researchers within a cloud computing framework. NARRATIVE MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt) RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate levels of gene products, including proteins that are drug targets in cancer. In order to shift medical practice towards personalized treatments, the proposed research will apply innovative analysis methods to understand the role of miRNA expression on survival and drug response, within the context of DNA, RNA and protein data generated in a large research network. This will help identify cancer subtypes, and individual patient phenotypes, in which alterations in miRNA expression can lead to particular cancer progression pathways and treatment responses, in order to inform disease management.",Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics,9210297,U24CA210952,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Biogenesis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Targeting', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Sequences', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'flexibility', 'gene product', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor progression', 'working group']",NCI,BRITISH COLUMBIA CANCER AGENCY,U24,2016,394335,0.07327143489661185
"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,9194067,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'genomic tools', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'industry partner', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oncology', 'precision medicine', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,562825,0.06555928280115578
"Online Raman Diagnostics of Oncometabolites Project Abstract  Cancer cells utilize normal metabolic processes out of context to promote tumor survival. For example, Otto Warburg and others discovered that tumors have increased glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production, often with a reduction in citric acid cycle. While “aerobic glycolysis” at first glance is energetically expensive for tumor cells because it circumvents high ATP production from the citric acid cycle, it allows cancer cells to survive under low nutrient or low oxygen conditions and to instead use glycolytic intermediates for the synthesis of essential cellular building blocks without further energy investment. This change in metabolite regulation suggests a powerful method for monitoring and diagnosing cancer.  This project seeks to develop surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) as online detection method for the characterization of metabolites from breast cancer tumor models. Using the SERS results from tumor lysates, diagnostic algorithms will be constructed to improve treatment for cancer. Results show that fluid dynamics can be used to increase the reproducibility and sensitivity of SERS detection in flowing liquids. We propose to develop methodology to enable the use this innovation to investigate metabolites in cancer cell lysates using capillary electrophoresis coupled to a SERS flow detector. We will investigate known metabolites that have been linked to cancer, as well as examine key metabolites associated with oncogenes. The SERS data collected will be used to formulate diagnostic algorithms that can provide a yes/no indicator of cancer.  The specific aims of this project are as follows:  · AIM 1. Demonstrate the utility of the novel flow detector to assess changes in key metabolites from  tumor cell lysates. The tumor cell lysates will be compared with non-cancerous cell lysates to  identify trends in these metabolites relevant to breast cancer.  · AIM 2. Compare the identification and quantification capabilities with the current gold standard, LC-  MS. This aim will assess how SERS characterization both compares with existing technology but  also increases coverage of the metabolome.  · AIM 3. We will use the metabolites to develop statistical machine learning algorithms to predict the  sample label (cancer or not). The predictor obtained will be used as a diagnostic tool of cancer.

"Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of cancer genomics, combined with increased understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenesis, has stimulated hope that treatment will improve by becoming more targeted and individualized in nature. Cancer genomics studies established a number of critical cancer genes, leading to a number of successful targeted therapies (e.g. Gleevec, Herceptin and Plexxikon). Despite these successes, most cancers do not have a targeted therapy and when one exists, response is highly variable, even among patients that share the targeted mutation and tumor type. To move cancer into the era of personalized therapies, it becomes important to identify the alterations driving tumor progression in each tumor, determine the network that links these aberrations, and identify factors that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. As projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) amass cancer cell genomes at a breathtaking pace, a staggering genetic complexity is revealed. To interpret cancer genomes, a key computational challenge is to separate the wheat from the chaff and define both what are the key alterations likely to be functionally driving cancer and then, after defining such genes, begin to identify mechanisms of action and therapeutic implications. Leveraging components from our published methods, CONEXIC (Akavia et.al Cell 2010) and LirNet (Lee et.al, PLOS Gen 2009), we will develop machine-learning algorithms that integrate cancer genomic data to do just that. We will apply the methods we develop to melanoma, glioblastoma, ovarian, breast and colon cancer and experimentally follow up on our computational findings, towards a better understanding of each of these deadly cancers. The approaches developed in this grant will accelerate discovery to rapidly extract the maximal value from modern genomic studies and help carry cancer genomics from the diagnostic to the therapeutic realm. This work aims to develop methods that help dissect the genetic complexity of individual cancers. For each tumor we aim to identify which mutations arm a cell with the abilities to abnormally grow or evade drug treatment, providing a foundation of tools towards personalized cancer treatment. We will apply these methods for discovery in some of the most aggressive cancers that currently lack good therapeutic solutions including glioblastoma, ovarian cancer and melanoma.","Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs",9091484,R01CA164729,"['AKT inhibition', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gleevec', 'Glioblastoma', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Measures', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Publishing', 'RNA interference screen', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trastuzumab', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'response', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'tumorigenic']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2016,464984,0.09425673122994688
"An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA PROJECT SUMMARY Recent studies revealed that the human genome encodes thousands of lncRNAs with little proteincoding capacity. LncRNAs were shown to play important roles in cancer and are potentially a new class of therapeutic targets for cancer. However, the function of the vast majority of lncRNAs in cancer remains unknown. LncRNA function often depends on its physical interactions with protein complexes. They can also influence the abundance of other mRNAs that are targeted by the same microRNAs by competing for microRNA binding, i.e., serving as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Advances in genomic technologies, especially those based on next generation sequencing (NGS), provide unparalleled opportunities to characterize the functional networks of lncRNA in cancer. However, analysis and integration of different types of genomic datasets to generate testable hypotheses is challenging, and systematic approaches to characterize lncRNA function in cancer are lacking. This application describes the development of computational methods and integrative genomic strategies for systematically dissecting the functional network of lncRNA in cancer, and a combination of computational and experimental approaches to unravel several important functional networks of lncRNA in prostate cancer. Specifically, it will (1) develop a computational method for repurposing the publically available array-based data to interrogate lncRNA expression in tumor samples and utilize an integrative genomic strategy to predict lncRNAs that may be important for tumorigenesis/tumor suppression in prostate cancer via analysis of lncRNA expression profiles, clinical information and somatic genomic alteration profiles of tumor samples, (2) identify the lncRNAs that are associated with EZH2 or direct transcriptional targets of EZH2 repression that are important for prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression, and (3) identify the ceRNAs of AR and PTEN that mediate prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression. In addition to its scientific proposal, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in the fields of computational genomics, noncoding RNA and cancer, who develops cutting-edge computational methods, and uses a combination of computational and experimental approaches to understand structure-function relationship of noncoding RNA and the function of noncoding RNA and RNA-protein interaction in cancer. While the candidate of this application has received extensive training in biophysics, statistics, machine learning and computational genomics, this career development award will allow him to develop his experimental skills, especially those next-generation sequencing-based techniques and molecular biology experiments in human cell lines. Dr. Liu, Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Dr. Brown, Professor of Medicine will mentor the candidate in the excellent training environment of Dana Farber Cancer Institute, a part of Harvard Medical School community. A committee of experienced computational and cancer biologists will also advise him on both scientific research and career development. The proposed study is to decipher lncRNA function in cancer using a combination of novel computational methods and high-throughput experimental technologies. The proposed research will result in publically available bioinformatic resources for studying lncRNA function in cancer, a greater understanding of IncRNA function in prostate cancer, and will help to discover novel therapeutic target of lncRNA for treating prostate cancer.",An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA,9001952,R00CA175290,"['Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Biophysics', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Exons', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTEN gene', 'Play', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'RNA', 'RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'career development', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experience', 'mRNA Expression', 'medical schools', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'professor', 'prostate carcinogenesis', 'protein complex', 'research and development', 'research study', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R00,2016,201953,-0.020785621731549027
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance.

"Hardwiring Mechanism into Predicting Cancer Phenotypes by Computational Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Few biomarkers derived from genome scale data have translated into improved clinical classification of cancer subtypes, in spite of the wealth of available genome-wide studies and of the corresponding application of numerous statistical algorithms. This widespread shortcoming derives from the pervasive use of ""off the shelf"" algorithms and machine learning techniques developed for image classification and language processing, which are naïve of the underlying biology of the system. Furthermore, for genome-wide data, the number of samples is often small relative to the number of potential candidate biomarkers, resulting in variable accuracy on independent test data despite high accuracy in the samples used for discovery, which contributes to the failure of clinical biomarkers. This problem - so called ""curse of dimensionality"" - is further exacerbated by the prohibitive cost of dramatically increasing sample size and by patient stratification into smaller subgroups for personalized and precision medicine. Disease phenotypes arise from distinct and specific perturbations in selected networks and pathways defined by the interactions of their molecular constituents. In cancer, these perturbations may reside in gene regulatory networks topology and state, in cell signaling activity, or in metabolic conditions. We hypothesize that by leveragin such prior biological information on cancer biology we will be able to reduce model complexity and build mechanistically justified predictive models. To pursue this hypothesis, we will develop an analytical framework to embed mechanistic constraints derived from network biology into the statistical learning process itself. Hence, this application will develop a novel suite of statistial learning algorithms that embed (Aim 1) gene expression regulatory networks, (Aim 2) cell signaling activity, and (Aim 3) metabolism to classify breast and prostate cancer. Throughout the study we will work closely with clinical collaborators to ensure that our method improve over and above current predictive and prognostic models. Finally, since in our study we will also generate mechanistic classifiers based on gene expression measurements obtained from clinical assays that are already commercially available (i.e., MammaPrint®, and Decipher®), our innovative models and predictors will be also readily available for clinical translation. Our mechanism-driven classifiers will simultaneously have greater accuracy and interpretability than classifiers developed without regard for the underlying biology of the disease. Furthermore, embedding biological mechanisms in the classifiers will also facilitate the identification of alternative therapeutic targets specific to each cancer subtype, potentially improving patient prognosis and health outcomes. Finally, the substantial curation of molecular pathways and biological networks we will carry on in the project will also provide a powerful resource for futur studies, and the methodologies we will develop will be also applicable to other cancer and other human diseases, like neurodegenerative disorders, hearth disease, and diabetes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative This study will use mechanistic biological knowledge to implement a suite of statistical algorithms for cancer patient classification, which will also reveal the biological reasoning behind the classification decision rules. In the study we will also apply our novel methods to develop improved biomarkers for breast and prostate cancer patient clinical stratification, with the ultimate goal of facilitating the selection of appropriate treatment. To achieve this goal we will directly improve the existing commercial tests offered to the patients, with an immediate clinical impact, since our biomarkers will be directly implementable into these assays, with the potential to quickly reach the bedside.",Hardwiring Mechanism into Predicting Cancer Phenotypes by Computational Learning,9003242,R01CA200859,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Models', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker development', 'cancer cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'candidate marker', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'feeding', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized health care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,400481,0.020420584775503965
"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,9091436,P50CA121973,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Antigens', 'Apoptotic', 'BRAF gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cell Vaccine', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interferon Alfa-2b', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specialized Program of Research Excellence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Banking', 'Tissue Banks', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute', 'Unresectable', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'career development', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'data management', 'design', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'inflammatory marker', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'melanoma', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel vaccines', 'oncology', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy outcome', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P50,2016,2162000,0.03268386148222658
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.

"Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer genomics resources are growing at an unprecedented pace. However, a comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome still remains a daunting challenge. This is in part due to the difficulties in visualizing, integrating, and analyzng cancer genomics data with current technologies. We propose to develop a cloud-based platform to empower researchers with the ability to host, visualize and analyze their own data. The platform is composed of a set of Cancer Analytics Virtual Machines (CAVMs). The main component of each CAVM is a data server which functions to store and serve user data to applications, such as the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, to provide data visualization. The second component is a modified Galaxy workflow system to provide data analysis capability. UCSC's suite of analysis tools for nextgen sequencing data analysis and pathway inference will be prepackaged with the system. The two components will be highly integrated to allow tightly coupled cycles of data visualization and analysis. The data server component will be modular such that it can provide data independently to applications besides the Cancer Browser and Galaxy. We will deliver virtual machine images that can be easily initiated in a commercial cloud such as Amazon, or can be installed within a user's own institution. The CAVM also functions as a way for users to Integrate with external large-scale databases. We will deliver a UCSC CAVM that other CAVM instances can connect to, to provide authorized data access from the UCSC cancer genomics data repository. The system allows the dynamic formation of new datasets composed of data slices from multiple sources. This ability to combine data into larger samples will provide the statistical power to allow discoveries that would otherwise not be possible. We aim to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the overhead of system configuration and software installation. Our tools will provide users the capability to access a cloud-based cluster computing environment, which will make sophisticated, computationally intensive analyses accessible to researchers who might not, have access to compute servers. The software platform we develop can be used by individual bench biologists, and also by large projects to serve data to individual users or to other projects. This design has the potential to form an expansive federated database accessible through the same software interface.         RELEVANCE: Currently, clinicians and bench biologists typically depend on external collaborators for data analysis. The proposed system will provide these scientists with data analysis and visualization methods that are both powerful and easy to use.

Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,9067260,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2016,347700,-0.0021086688187394783
"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,9135254,U24CA189523,"['Algorithmic Software', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Activities', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular subtypes', 'open source', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2016,649474,-0.03805413748487734
"Determinants of pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma phenotypes in CDKN2A hereditary kindreds This proposal addresses Provocative Question #2. We will use innovative approaches to investigate how CDKN2A (which encodes p16) mutation carriers develop different cancer phenotypes (pancreatic cancer vs melanoma vs no cancer), and include both genetic and non-genetic factors. We have identified 4 large, multi- generational kindreds with a founder CDKN2A deleterious mutation (L16R, 47T>G). Our preliminary observations demonstrate that this mutant has lower expression and decreased ability to regulate cell cycle progression compared to wild type protein. Our sequencing studies of kindred members with different cancer phenotypes have identified potential variants in novel genes that modify risk (LGR6, a co-receptor of Wnt signaling and COL11A1, which participates in oncogenic signaling, including TGFbeta). We will determine the ability of the p16 mutant to promote transformation and how it is influenced by interaction with the above candidate modifier genes, LGR6 or COL11A1, in pancreatic cancer and melanoma. We will also develop novel computational models using machine deep learning, to generate networks that capture high dimensional features to integrate gene, biology, and cancer phenotype. This approach will be extended to kindreds with other CDKN2A mutations. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify genotypes of potential modifier genes in multiple kindreds that feature pancreatic cancer and melanoma and known to carry CDKN2A germline mutations. We will use genome wide variant coverage of germline DNA from CDKN2A carriers from the 4 large L16R kindreds, plus additional members in 42 other similar CDKN2A kindreds. We will identify candidate modifier genes in the kindreds by rule-based statistical genetic analysis of genotypes. (2) Define the impact of CDKN2A L16R mutation on the function of p16 and its interplay with candidate modifier genes. We will elucidate the biological significance of mutations in CDKN2A and candidate modifier genes using functional and high throughput methodologies by analyzing the mechanism underlying the interplay between p16 and modifier genes; define new pathways cooperating with this interplay using a combination of genome wide studies to assess transformation in cells carrying p16 mutant or wild-type background using well established in vitro and in vivo models. (3) Develop a deep learning network model to integrate genetic, biological and epidemiological data to accurately infer pancreatic cancer and melanoma phenotypes and age of onset in mutation carriers. We will apply a convolutional neural network, a deep learning algorithm in the training dataset, develop a back-propagation algorithm to fine tune “weights,” and construct mutation-gene networks to capture high-dimensional features for each disease subclass. We will acquire and disseminate new knowledge and tools to the scientific community. Our integrated methods and approach will bring insight into how different cancer phenotypes can occur with identical predisposing mutations, which can be applied to other cancer syndromes with similar challenges.

"Advanced Development of TIES-Enhancing Access to Tissue for Cancer Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Archived human tissues are an essential resource for translational research. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from cancer patients are used in a wide range of assays, including RT-PCR, SNP profiling, multiplex biomarkers, imaging biomarkers, targeted exome, whole exome, and whole genome sequencing. Remainder FFPE tissues generated during patient care are 'retrospective'; use of these tissues under specific conditions does not require consent. For personalized medicine researchers, these specimens are vital resources enabling biomarker validation, detailed molecular analysis, and systems modeling before application is made to individual patients. But access to these human tissues is often a rate limiting factor in cancer research. We propose advanced development of the TIES software to (1) increase institutional capacity for using FFPE to support molecular characterization of human tumors, (2) increase access to tissues within cancer centers, and (3) improve the ability to share tissues and associated phenotype data among cancer centers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This work proposes the development of a software system that will enhance the ability of cancer researchers to find and use human tissues and accompanying electronic data for scientific research.

"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9176586,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'industry partner', 'lymph nodes', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,699670,-0.03455432660644354
"Integrative approach for predicting cancer driver genes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Carcinogenesis, progression of normal cells to malignant cancer, derives from hallmark capabilities of cancer driven by acquiring (somatic) mutations in ""driver genes"" with a selective advantage for cellular proliferation and potentially metastasis. A major motivation for modern cancer genomics studies is to decipher the genetic architecture of cancer by discovering new driver genes. The most widely-used approaches to predict and prioritize driver genes are based on statistics of mutation frequencies. Several methods have been proposed to identify genes with an excessive number of somatic mutations [9-11], known as significantly mutated genes. I propose to address two major limitations of this approach. First, these methods are insufficiently statistically powered given the amount of sequencing data currently available [15]. I will improve statistical power by leveraging diverse information in cancer genomics currently available into a developed machine learning method. Second, there is little objective clarity about the true effectiveness of these methods [11, 14], since there is no agreed-upon gold standard of driver genes, with the exception of a few well-known drivers. I will develop a framework to compare the effectiveness of driver gene prediction methods, in the absence of a gold standard. Both effectively and efficiently identifying cancer driver genes is a matter of great importance to science funding policy towards cancer genomics.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Large sequencing studies have revolutionized our capability to identify the genetic architecture of cancer. However, effectively integrating this stream of big data to identify specific driver genes has remained troublesome. My proposed research project aims to develop an integrative machine learning method that leverages diverse features in cancer genomics to improve predictions of cancer driver genes, and to utilize a principled approach for evaluating the performance of any such method.            ",Integrative approach for predicting cancer driver genes,8982803,F31CA200266,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Normal Cell', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Property', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Bias', 'Stream', 'Tumor Biology', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'carcinogenesis', 'compare effectiveness', 'improved', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'statistics']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,43120,0.047530070111719884
"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.                ",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9044512,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Family', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forging', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'model building', 'molecular imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,198952,0.04765487375809762
"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI's second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies. Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals' cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.",A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk,8876609,R01CA170508,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cancer Patient', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'High Performance Computing', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Individual Cancer History', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nomads', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'age group', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cyber security', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'environment related cancer', 'environmental carcinogenesis', 'experience', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'migration', 'novel', 'population migration', 'social', 'social networking website', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend', 'web site']",NCI,"UT-BATTELLE, LLC-OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LAB",R01,2015,392385,0.04397564682767493
"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance. The Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC) will develop quantitative approaches to understand, study and find potential novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of solid tumors.        Average Scores of the Components:    Overall:			2.7    Project 1:			2.7    Project 2:			2.3    Project 3:			4.3    Resource Core 1:		2.2    Education and Outreach:	2.9            ",Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity,8866149,U54CA193313,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug resistance', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Institution', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'New York', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organoids', 'Penetrance', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bcr-abl Fusion Proteins', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'imprint', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'leukemia', 'mathematical methods', 'metropolitan', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'oncology', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'physical science', 'pressure', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'single cell sequencing', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'traditional therapy', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U54,2015,1990894,0.059647285696624426
"Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of cancer genomics, combined with increased understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenesis, has stimulated hope that treatment will improve by becoming more targeted and individualized in nature. Cancer genomics studies established a number of critical cancer genes, leading to a number of successful targeted therapies (e.g. Gleevec, Herceptin and Plexxikon). Despite these successes, most cancers do not have a targeted therapy and when one exists, response is highly variable, even among patients that share the targeted mutation and tumor type. To move cancer into the era of personalized therapies, it becomes important to identify the alterations driving tumor progression in each tumor, determine the network that links these aberrations, and identify factors that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. As projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) amass cancer cell genomes at a breathtaking pace, a staggering genetic complexity is revealed. To interpret cancer genomes, a key computational challenge is to separate the wheat from the chaff and define both what are the key alterations likely to be functionally driving cancer and then, after defining such genes, begin to identify mechanisms of action and therapeutic implications. Leveraging components from our published methods, CONEXIC (Akavia et.al Cell 2010) and LirNet (Lee et.al, PLOS Gen 2009), we will develop machine-learning algorithms that integrate cancer genomic data to do just that. We will apply the methods we develop to melanoma, glioblastoma, ovarian, breast and colon cancer and experimentally follow up on our computational findings, towards a better understanding of each of these deadly cancers. The approaches developed in this grant will accelerate discovery to rapidly extract the maximal value from modern genomic studies and help carry cancer genomics from the diagnostic to the therapeutic realm. This work aims to develop methods that help dissect the genetic complexity of individual cancers. For each tumor we aim to identify which mutations arm a cell with the abilities to abnormally grow or evade drug treatment, providing a foundation of tools towards personalized cancer treatment. We will apply these methods for discovery in some of the most aggressive cancers that currently lack good therapeutic solutions including glioblastoma, ovarian cancer and melanoma.","Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs",8913905,R01CA164729,"['AKT inhibition', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug resistance', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gleevec', 'Glioblastoma', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Measures', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Resistance', 'Roche brand of trastuzumab', 'Role', 'Solutions', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'follow-up', 'human FRAP1 protein', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'response', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'tumorigenic']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2015,554295,0.09425673122994688
"Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional genomic strategies have been widely implemented to define unique molecular subtypes of cancer in order to predict phenotypic properties such as metastatic potential and sensitivity to therapeutic compounds. However, changes in the level of gene and protein expression can be circumstantial and therefore play no functional role in the development of the disease. One of the hallmarks of aggressive cancer is its ability to escape the cellular milieu and spread to new tissues, a process that is mediated in part by the activity of extracellular proteases. Protease activity is tightly regulated by subcelluar localization, the presence of endogenous protease inhibitors, and requisite conversion from inactive precursor forms. Therefore, in these circumstances, it is not enough to know protease expression levels alone. We propose that global profiles of extracellular protease activity may emerge as a powerful functional tool for the molecular stratification of cancer. The Craik laboratory has developed a novel mass spectrometry-based screening technology that can identify the global substrate specificity and kinetic efficiency of proteases alone and in complex biological mixtures by employing a small, diverse library of rationally designed peptide substrates. This technology, referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), marks a significant breakthrough in protease profiling by allowing for the unbiased and simultaneous detection of all protease activities in a given sample. In this proposal, the Craik laboratory will partner with the Sali laboratory to develop and test computational models that classify cancer samples on the basis of protease specificity with the goal of building protease-activatable diagnostics for subtype-specific imaging. Global profiles of extracellular protease activity from increasingly complex breast and prostate cancer samples will be determined using the MSP-MS assay. In parallel, machine learning algorithms will be used to develop specificity-based classification models that will be correlated to known metrics for tumor aggressiveness. Sub-libraries of peptide sequences that represent the major classification groups identified will aid in designing protease-activatable imaging probes that will be tested experimentally for subtype selectivity. Probe cleavage sequences will be iteratively refined to improve selectivity through both incorporation of cleavage rates into the modeling strategy and peptide docking against the 3D structures of the target proteases. The new class of reagents developed will be applied to and further optimized against clinical correlations in the next phase of the project. We anticipate that our strategy for generating tailored diagnostics for the functional profiling of cancer will advance the identification and monitoring of disease as well as aid in cancer biomarker discovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advancements in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer require new technologies that can define disease at the molecular level. Proteases are a class of proteins that are essential molecular players in normal cellular function but also are responsible for the spread of aggressive cancers when their activities become unregulated. We are developing new computational models and screening strategies to design personalized diagnostics that target active proteases in different subtypes of cancer with the goal of improving cancer identification and informing treatment decision-making for patients.",Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer,8829207,R21CA186077,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell secretion', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug resistance', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic approach', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteomics', 'Reagent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Markers', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'prostate cancer cell line', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2015,168280,0.03916298664108059
"An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA PROJECT SUMMARY Recent studies revealed that the human genome encodes thousands of lncRNAs with little proteincoding capacity. LncRNAs were shown to play important roles in cancer and are potentially a new class of therapeutic targets for cancer. However, the function of the vast majority of lncRNAs in cancer remains unknown. LncRNA function often depends on its physical interactions with protein complexes. They can also influence the abundance of other mRNAs that are targeted by the same microRNAs by competing for microRNA binding, i.e., serving as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Advances in genomic technologies, especially those based on next generation sequencing (NGS), provide unparalleled opportunities to characterize the functional networks of lncRNA in cancer. However, analysis and integration of different types of genomic datasets to generate testable hypotheses is challenging, and systematic approaches to characterize lncRNA function in cancer are lacking. This application describes the development of computational methods and integrative genomic strategies for systematically dissecting the functional network of lncRNA in cancer, and a combination of computational and experimental approaches to unravel several important functional networks of lncRNA in prostate cancer. Specifically, it will (1) develop a computational method for repurposing the publically available array-based data to interrogate lncRNA expression in tumor samples and utilize an integrative genomic strategy to predict lncRNAs that may be important for tumorigenesis/tumor suppression in prostate cancer via analysis of lncRNA expression profiles, clinical information and somatic genomic alteration profiles of tumor samples, (2) identify the lncRNAs that are associated with EZH2 or direct transcriptional targets of EZH2 repression that are important for prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression, and (3) identify the ceRNAs of AR and PTEN that mediate prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression. In addition to its scientific proposal, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in the fields of computational genomics, noncoding RNA and cancer, who develops cutting-edge computational methods, and uses a combination of computational and experimental approaches to understand structure-function relationship of noncoding RNA and the function of noncoding RNA and RNA-protein interaction in cancer. While the candidate of this application has received extensive training in biophysics, statistics, machine learning and computational genomics, this career development award will allow him to develop his experimental skills, especially those next-generation sequencing-based techniques and molecular biology experiments in human cell lines. Dr. Liu, Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Dr. Brown, Professor of Medicine will mentor the candidate in the excellent training environment of Dana Farber Cancer Institute, a part of Harvard Medical School community. A committee of experienced computational and cancer biologists will also advise him on both scientific research and career development. The proposed study is to decipher lncRNA function in cancer using a combination of novel computational methods and high-throughput experimental technologies. The proposed research will result in publically available bioinformatic resources for studying lncRNA function in cancer, a greater understanding of IncRNA function in prostate cancer, and will help to discover novel therapeutic target of lncRNA for treating prostate cancer.",An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA,8994367,R00CA175290,"['Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Biophysics', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Exons', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTEN gene', 'Play', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'RNA', 'RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Untranslated RNA', 'base', 'career development', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experience', 'human EZH2 protein', 'mRNA Expression', 'medical schools', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'professor', 'prostate carcinogenesis', 'protein complex', 'research and development', 'research study', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R00,2015,249000,-0.020785621731549027
"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,8919260,P50CA121973,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Antigens', 'Apoptotic', 'BRAF gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cell Vaccine', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interferon Alfa-2b', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specialized Program of Research Excellence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Banking', 'Tissue Banks', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute', 'Unresectable', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'base', 'career development', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'data management', 'design', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory marker', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'melanoma', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel vaccines', 'oncology', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P50,2015,2185000,0.03268386148222658
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.

"Using medical informatics to follow-up a colorectal sessile serrated polyp cohort DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence suggests that sessile serrated polyps (SSPs), flat, colonic lesions with architectural abnormalities at the base of crypts and a serrated appearance, may be important precursors to colorectal cancer. Previously, advanced adenomas were the only known polyp precursors for colorectal cancer, and SSPs were clinically grouped with hyperplastic polyps, lesions routinely believed to have no malignant potential. Now, there is growing consensus that SSPs progress to cancer along the ""serrated pathway"". New guidelines were developed in 2012 recommending complete removal of SSPs and increased colorectal cancer surveillance in patients with a history of SSPs. However, these guidelines acknowledge that these new recommendations are largely based on cross-sectional data, with the only longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs limited by size (n=40). Therefore, the primary objective of this application is to gather preliminary data to estimate the risk of colorectal cancer in a large cohort of patients with clinically diagnosed SSPs. We will address the following specific aims: 1) compare the risk of subsequent colorectal cancer in patients who had SSPs diagnosed at an index colonoscopy to patients with advanced adenomas, and estimate the time to cancer progression in both polyp groups; 2) among those with SSPs at index colonoscopy, evaluate whether risk of incident colorectal cancer varies according to size and location of the index SSP. To accomplish these aims, we propose a cohort study of 2,250 patients evaluated via an index colonoscopy between 2003 and 2011 at the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic and diagnosed with SSPs (N=750) or advanced adenomas (N=1,500). Using University of Washington's established Microsoft Amalga data aggregation platform, which links electronic medical records data across different sources, we have already identified our study cohort. Additional medical informatics and natural language processing will be used to electronically extract data on patient characteristics, and index polyp size and location. Then, we will electronically follow-up patients for incident colorectal cancer through December 2012 by linking our study cohort to the Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Registry (SEER), a population based cancer registry covering western Washington State, including the catchment area for the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic patient population. Cox regression models will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of colorectal cancer risk comparing patients with SSPs to those with advanced adenomas (Aim 1) and to estimate colorectal cancer risk between patients with different polyp characteristics among those with SSPs (Aim 2). This will be the largest longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs to date and the first study in a colonoscopy-based cohort to estimate incidence of colorectal cancer in those with SSPs diagnosed though usual care in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to determine the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with clinically diagnosed sessile serrated polyps. New research links these polyps to a subset of colorectal cancer that tends to be missed during cancer screening.

"Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer genomics resources are growing at an unprecedented pace. However, a comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome still remains a daunting challenge. This is in part due to the difficulties in visualizing, integrating, and analyzng cancer genomics data with current technologies. We propose to develop a cloud-based platform to empower researchers with the ability to host, visualize and analyze their own data. The platform is composed of a set of Cancer Analytics Virtual Machines (CAVMs). The main component of each CAVM is a data server which functions to store and serve user data to applications, such as the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, to provide data visualization. The second component is a modified Galaxy workflow system to provide data analysis capability. UCSC's suite of analysis tools for nextgen sequencing data analysis and pathway inference will be prepackaged with the system. The two components will be highly integrated to allow tightly coupled cycles of data visualization and analysis. The data server component will be modular such that it can provide data independently to applications besides the Cancer Browser and Galaxy. We will deliver virtual machine images that can be easily initiated in a commercial cloud such as Amazon, or can be installed within a user's own institution. The CAVM also functions as a way for users to Integrate with external large-scale databases. We will deliver a UCSC CAVM that other CAVM instances can connect to, to provide authorized data access from the UCSC cancer genomics data repository. The system allows the dynamic formation of new datasets composed of data slices from multiple sources. This ability to combine data into larger samples will provide the statistical power to allow discoveries that would otherwise not be possible. We aim to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the overhead of system configuration and software installation. Our tools will provide users the capability to access a cloud-based cluster computing environment, which will make sophisticated, computationally intensive analyses accessible to researchers who might not, have access to compute servers. The software platform we develop can be used by individual bench biologists, and also by large projects to serve data to individual users or to other projects. This design has the potential to form an expansive federated database accessible through the same software interface.         RELEVANCE: Currently, clinicians and bench biologists typically depend on external collaborators for data analysis. The proposed system will provide these scientists with data analysis and visualization methods that are both powerful and easy to use.

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary It is estimated that there will be about 12,340 new cases of cervical cancer and those 4,030 women will die of this disease this year in the United States (American Cancer Society). Worldwide, invasive cervical cancer is an even greater problem and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. A method to accurately predict cervical cancer outcome prior to standard therapy would be critical for the early identification of patients with high risk of treatment failures. For these high-risk patients modified therapy could potentially be applied for improved patient survival. However, traditional clinic pathologic features, such as tumor grade and stage, have limited prognostic values in cervical cancer. Thus, new methods need to be developed for improved prognostic performance. In this proposed research, we will test the hypothesis that the expression signature of multiple selected microRNAs can reliably predict the outcome of cervical cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered family of small non- coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers to predict cancer therapy outcomes. However, the prognostic value of miRNAs in cervical cancer has not been investigated. The major goal of this research is to build a miRNA-based model to robustly predict cervical cancer outcome. Our preliminary analysis has identified two miRNAs that are predictive of cervical cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all cervix-related miRNAs in a large number of cervical tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of cervical cancer. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, leading to about 300,000 deaths each year. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized cervical cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non- coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER,8827726,R21CA177902,"['American Cancer Society', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cervix Neoplasms', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'public health relevance', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2015,165844,0.06999786611792896
"Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large tumor exome sequencing projects have identified a very large number of mutations whose cancer relevance is not yet understood. To begin to address this need, our team has produced two web applications for high-throughput computational analysis of cancer mutations: the Cancer-Related Analysis of VAriants Toolkit (CRAVAT) and the Mutation Position Imaging Toolbox (MuPIT). CRAVAT accepts millions of mutations in a single batch upload and maps mutations from genomic coordinates to annotated transcripts and proteins. MuPIT currently accepts batch uploads of up to 2500 SNVs and maps from genomic coordinates onto X-ray crystal structures of proteins from Protein Data Bank (PDB). We propose to combine and harden CRAVAT and MuPIT into a single web application, in which we will substantially improve the tools, user interface, software infrastructure, integration with external data resources and tools used by the community, and support for protected data. The scope of all tools in the web application will be broadened to handle analysis of the full range of small-scale mutation consequence types found in cancer exomes.  CRAVAT analysis identifies mutations most likely to have deleterious impact on protein function and those that are most likely to confer a selective advantage to cancer cells (drivers), using classifiers developed by our team. Classifier scores are supplemented with annotations, including population allele frequencies, previous occurrence in tumor tissue types, and gene functional categories, enabling filtering (e.g. removing polymorphisms) and prioritization. Gene-level annotation and scoring, by aggregation of classifier scores from mutations in a cohort is also provided.  MuPIT maps mutations from genomic positions onto to protein structures and provides interactive viewing of mutations in the context of protein structure, and in relation to a variety of annotations. To enable prioritization of interesting mutations and genes, the application provides a preview describing each structure and all available annotations (e.g., binding sites, experimental mutagenesis results, polymorphic and disease- associated variants that have been previously documented). After selecting a PDB of interest, the user is led to an interactive visualization page. An enhanced Jmol applet displays all SNVs mapped onto the structure. Frequently, many SNVs in the input list can be mapped onto a single structure, revealing clustering patterns around key functional sites.  Based only on word-of-mouth, since the debut of the two applications in August 2012, CRAVAT has been utilized by 129 unique users from 39 countries, and it has analyzed 1,136 submitted jobs, totaling 27.9 million mutations. MuPIT has been utilized by 242 unique users from 25 countries, with 720 submitted jobs. (Source: Google Analytics). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will harden and develop web applications for the cancer genomics community to interpret small-scale mutations in cancer exomes. They are designed to handle very large number of mutations and to provide analysis targeted at researchers who are not bioinformatics experts.

"Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The explosion of imaging technologies that evaluate structural, physiologic and molecular properties of cancer, has generated large and diverse amounts of data, ranging from diverse molecular imaging probes to structural and physiologic imaging at the organ level. This transition of oncologic imaging from its ""industrial era"" to it is ""information era"" has necessitated the development of analytical methods that 1) extract from this data information that is clinically and biologically relevant; 2) integrate imaging, clinical nd genomic data via rigorous statistical and computational methodologies in order to derive models valuable for understanding cancer mechanisms, but also for diagnosis, prognostic assessment, response evaluation, and personalized (or ""precision"") treatment management; 3) are available to the biomedical community for easy use and application, with the aim of understanding, diagnosing, and treating cancer. Building and disseminating advanced information technology for computational cancer phenomics, largely captured by diverse imaging technologies, is the emphasis of the proposed work. In particular, we propose to develop and widely distribute the cancer phenomics toolkit (CapTk), a software suite integrating advanced oncologic image computing and analytics tools that have been developed by our groups here at Penn and offer sophisticated quantitative analytics of oncologic images well beyond currently used methods. Importantly, these informatics tools have been developed in the context of active clinical studies and collaborations and have therefore being inspired and tested by real clinical needs. Although the main focus of our work is CapTk, which we view as an advanced computational suite that can be incorporated into, and further enable, various commercial (e.g. BrainLab, Hologic's, GE's, see letters) and non-commercial (the open source Slicer is our research platform) workstations, we will also use this software suite to develop two focused research prototype workstations leveraging upon the unique strengths of our work and clinical studies at Penn: an Advanced Neuro-Oncologic Computational Imaging Workstation (ANCI) and the Advanced Breast Computational Imaging Workstation (ABCI). In particular, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) To refine, extensively document and integrate our image analysis algorithms and software into CapTk, which will have 3 major components pertaining to imaging measurements and decision support: Image Registration Suite; Imaging Feature Extraction Suite; Suite for Imaging Analytics and Predictive Modeling. Aim 2) To develop and test two focused research prototype workstations, ANCI and ABCI, aiming to provide diagnostic and treatment decision support mechanisms for brain and breast cancer management. Aim 3) Disseminate software and knowledge, via a) deploying our software to the clinic at Penn as well as to selected collaborating institutions, in order to test and further refine the software accordig to feedback; b) freely distributing our software to the research community; c) organizing various educational activities for both clinicians and informaticians, and setting up and maintaining support forums.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will develop advanced computer analysis methodology for interpretation of radiologic images of cancer, emphasizing brain and breast cancer. The functionality of the software will substantially transcend limitations of current analysis of cancer images, and will open the way for more precise and effective surgical planning as well as for more specific diagnosis of cancer based on its imaging characteristics, eventually leading to individualized medicine.                ",Cancer imaging phenomics software suite: application to brain and breast cancer,8967740,U24CA189523,"['Algorithmic Software', 'American College of Radiology Imaging Network', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Activities', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Genomics', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'follow-up', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging probe', 'individualized medicine', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular imaging', 'open source', 'phenomics', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U24,2015,653458,-0.03805413748487734
"(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every single cancer survivor fears relapse. While being free of the primary tumor after treatment is encouraging, it is emotionally devastating to step out of the clinic after a yearly checkup with a diagnosis of metastatic disease. Approximately 90% of cancer lethality is due to metastasis - the spreading of primary tumor cells to distant organs. Despite a dramatic increase in early screening methods and comprehensive treatment regimens for primary breast tumors, the overall mortality of patients who relapsed with metastatic cancer in the US has not changed in the past two decades. Clinical failure in treating metastatic tumors is largely due to the evolutionary nature of tumor metastasis. In order to survive and establish secondary tumors in a different tissue microenvironment at distant organs, disseminated tumor cells have to adapt (metastatic evolution) to the host environment. Clinically, metastatic tumors exhibit drastically different characteristics from their primary counterpart. Therefore, current cancer treatments, designed based on the features of primary tumors, are rarely effective.          Optimal design of breakthrough anti-metastasis therapies relies on our in-depth understanding of the common and functionally important traits during the early metastatic evolution. In this proposed study, we will use breast cancer brain metastasis as model system and take state-of-the-art approaches to trace and analyze a single cancer cell within its precise metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. This collaborative effort from a multidisciplinary team, including a cancer biologist, a computational biologist, a mathematician and a bioinformatician will allow us to: 1) depict the dynamics of gene transcription during the different stages of brain metastasis at single cell level; 2) visualize th behavior of a single colonized metastatic tumor cell and its interaction with the microenvironment through real-time intravital imaging and deep tissue imaging; 3) mathematically integrate molecular (RNA-seq), behavioral (intravital) and structural (deep tissue imaging) information to identify the common and functionally important early metastatic evolutionary traits during the breast cancer brain metastasis in its native tissue context.          Shifting the current clinical treatment model relies on new in-depth mechanistic insight obtained through basic and pre-clinical innovative research. Utilizing cutting-edge sequencing and imaging modality in our proposed study, we will have the capacity to systematically dissect traits of early metastatic behavior and discover potential novel therapeutic targets for paradigm-shifting novel adjuvant therapy tailored to specific target metastatic evolution. The conceptual validation from our bold and pioneering attempt proposed in this study will serves as a blueprint for a new category of adjuvant therapies for effective anti-metastasis treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Successful anti-metastasis treatment is rooted deep in our mechanistic understanding of early metastatic evolution and our capability to stop metastatic progression before aggressive outgrowth occurs. Using single cell transcriptome sequencing and multiplexed single cell deep-tissue imaging, we aim to trace and analyze the lineage dynamics of a single cancer cell within its specific metastatic microenvironment from the initial moment of metastatic colonization. The conceptual advances validated from this study will serve as a blueprint for future adjuvant therapies targeting early metastatic evolution, providing more effective cancer treatments.",(PQD-3) Spatiotemporal Molecular Interrogation of Early Metastatic Evolution In Situ,8876876,R01CA194697,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Distant', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Situ', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammary Neoplasms', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncologist', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Secondary to', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'checkup examination', 'clinical practice', 'data integration', 'design', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intravital imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'pressure', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2015,347700,-0.0021086688187394783
"Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wnt signaling is one of the most common pathways linked to carcinogenesis in the intestine. The transcription factors that mediate Wnt signals are members of the Lymphoid Enhancer Factor/T Cell Factor (LEF/TCF) family. This four-member family is complex in that there are full-length activating forms, truncated dominant negative forms, and alternatively spliced isoforms that modify Wnt target gene recognition. TCF-1 and TCF-4 are the two family members expressed in the epithelial crypt compartment of the intestine. Normally, TCF-1 is expressed as a dominant negative isoform and it counteracts the action of TCF-4 which is expressed as a Wnt-mediating, active isoform. This pattern changes in cancer because TCF-1 expression switches to a full-length, Wnt mediating form. We have discovered a second DNA binding domain in TCF-1 and TCF-4 isoforms called the C-clamp. We have shown that the C-clamp is important for regulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells. We have also identified Wnts that trigger TCF-1 export in colon cancer cells. Export of TCF-1 leaves the C-clamp form of TCF-4 in the nucleus to mediate aberrant Wnt signaling. Three aims are proposed for this project. First, the extracellular Wnts and intracellular components that direct TCF-1 nuclear export will be defined (Aim1). Second, the biological impact of export will be defined in colon cancer cells and colon cancer initiating 3D cultures (Aim2). Third, the DNA binding specificities and target gene selection of C-clamp forms of TCF-1 and TCF-4 will be defined through genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-Seq), high-throughput protein binding microarrays, and in vitro biochemical analysis (Aim3). The overall goal is to define the mechanisms behind changes in TCF expression in colon carcinogenesis, and to define how extracellular Wnts and DNA binding specificities of TCFs influence aberrant signaling in colon cancer cells with stabilized ß-catenin. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression. Wnt signaling is mediated by the TCF transcription factors and we have discovered their activities and expression to be different in colon cancer versus normal colon tissue. This project investigates basic mechanisms of TCF localization and gene targeting and asks how differences in these attributes contribute to the cancer cell phenotype.",Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer,8857373,R01CA108697,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Binding Domain', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dominant-Negative Mutation', 'Elements', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Funding', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mediating', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Export', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Response Elements', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'TCF Transcription Factor', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'autocrine', 'beta catenin', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'carcinogenesis', 'cell type', 'colon cancer cell line', 'colon carcinogenesis', 'expectation', 'extracellular', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'matrigel', 'member', 'paracrine', 'promoter', 'receptor', 'research study', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2015,286517,0.05162819876155048
"Advanced Development of TIES-Enhancing Access to Tissue for Cancer Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Archived human tissues are an essential resource for translational research. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from cancer patients are used in a wide range of assays, including RT-PCR, SNP profiling, multiplex biomarkers, imaging biomarkers, targeted exome, whole exome, and whole genome sequencing. Remainder FFPE tissues generated during patient care are 'retrospective'; use of these tissues under specific conditions does not require consent. For personalized medicine researchers, these specimens are vital resources enabling biomarker validation, detailed molecular analysis, and systems modeling before application is made to individual patients. But access to these human tissues is often a rate limiting factor in cancer research. We propose advanced development of the TIES software to (1) increase institutional capacity for using FFPE to support molecular characterization of human tumors, (2) increase access to tissues within cancer centers, and (3) improve the ability to share tissues and associated phenotype data among cancer centers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This work proposes the development of a software system that will enhance the ability of cancer researchers to find and use human tissues and accompanying electronic data for scientific research.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies revealed that the human genome encodes thousands of lncRNAs with little protein-coding capacity. LncRNAs were shown to play important roles in cancer and are potentially a new class of therapeutic targets for cancer. However, the function of the vast majority of lncRNAs in cancer remains unknown. LncRNA function often depends on its physical interactions with protein complexes. They can also influence the abundance of other mRNAs that are targeted by the same microRNAs by competing for microRNA binding, i.e., serving as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Advances in genomic technologies, especially those based on next generation sequencing (NGS), provide unparalleled opportunities to characterize the functional networks of lncRNA in cancer. However, analysis and integration of different types of genomic datasets to generate testable hypotheses is challenging, and systematic approaches to characterize lncRNA function in cancer are lacking. This application describes the development of computational methods and integrative genomic strategies for systematically dissecting the functional network of lncRNA in cancer, and a combination of computational and experimental approaches to unravel several important functional networks of lncRNA in prostate cancer. Specifically, it will (1) develop a computational method for repurposing the publically available array-based data to interrogate lncRNA expression in tumor samples and utilize an integrative genomic strategy to predict lncRNAs that may be important for tumorigenesis/tumor suppression in prostate cancer via analysis of lncRNA expression profiles, clinical information and somatic genomic alteration profiles of tumor samples, (2) identify the lncRNAs that are associated with EZH2 or direct transcriptional targets of EZH2 repression that are important for prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression, and (3) identify the ceRNAs of AR and PTEN that mediate prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression. In addition to its scientific proposal, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in the fields of computational genomics, non-coding RNA and cancer, who develops cutting-edge computational methods, and uses a combination of computational and experimental approaches to understand structure- function relationship of non-coding RNA and the function of non-coding RNA and RNA-protein interaction in cancer. While the candidate of this application has received extensive training in biophysics, statistics, machine learning and computational genomics, this career development award will allow him to develop his experimental skills, especially those next-generation sequencing-based techniques and molecular biology experiments in human cell lines. Dr. Liu, Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Dr. Brown, Professor of Medicine will mentor the candidate in the excellent training environment of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a part of Harvard Medical School community. A committee of experienced computational and cancer biologists will also advise him on both scientific research and career development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is to decipher lncRNA function in cancer using a combination of novel computational methods and high-throughput experimental technologies. The proposed research will result in publically available bioinformatic resources for studying lncRNA function in cancer, a greater understanding of lncRNA function in prostate cancer, and will help to discover novel therapeutic target of lncRNA for treating prostate cancer.",An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA,8710112,K99CA175290,"['Algorithms', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Biophysics', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Exons', 'Functional RNA', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'PTEN gene', 'Play', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Tumor Suppression', 'base', 'career development', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'experience', 'human EZH2 protein', 'mRNA Expression', 'medical schools', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'professor', 'prostate carcinogenesis', 'protein complex', 'research and development', 'research study', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2014,112476,-0.019850357309267465
"Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of cancer genomics, combined with increased understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenesis, has stimulated hope that treatment will improve by becoming more targeted and individualized in nature. Cancer genomics studies established a number of critical cancer genes, leading to a number of successful targeted therapies (e.g. Gleevec, Herceptin and Plexxikon). Despite these successes, most cancers do not have a targeted therapy and when one exists, response is highly variable, even among patients that share the targeted mutation and tumor type. To move cancer into the era of personalized therapies, it becomes important to identify the alterations driving tumor progression in each tumor, determine the network that links these aberrations, and identify factors that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. As projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) amass cancer cell genomes at a breathtaking pace, a staggering genetic complexity is revealed. To interpret cancer genomes, a key computational challenge is to separate the wheat from the chaff and define both what are the key alterations likely to be functionally driving cancer and then, after defining such genes, begin to identify mechanisms of action and therapeutic implications. Leveraging components from our published methods, CONEXIC (Akavia et.al Cell 2010) and LirNet (Lee et.al, PLOS Gen 2009), we will develop machine-learning algorithms that integrate cancer genomic data to do just that. We will apply the methods we develop to melanoma, glioblastoma, ovarian, breast and colon cancer and experimentally follow up on our computational findings, towards a better understanding of each of these deadly cancers. The approaches developed in this grant will accelerate discovery to rapidly extract the maximal value from modern genomic studies and help carry cancer genomics from the diagnostic to the therapeutic realm.          This work aims to develop methods that help dissect the genetic complexity of individual cancers. For each tumor we aim to identify which mutations arm a cell with the abilities to abnormally grow or evade drug treatment, providing a foundation of tools towards personalized cancer treatment. We will apply these methods for discovery in some of the most aggressive cancers that currently lack good therapeutic solutions including glioblastoma, ovarian cancer and melanoma.

"Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional genomic strategies have been widely implemented to define unique molecular subtypes of cancer in order to predict phenotypic properties such as metastatic potential and sensitivity to therapeutic compounds. However, changes in the level of gene and protein expression can be circumstantial and therefore play no functional role in the development of the disease. One of the hallmarks of aggressive cancer is its ability to escape the cellular milieu and spread to new tissues, a process that is mediated in part by the activity of extracellular proteases. Protease activity is tightly regulated by subcelluar localization, the presence of endogenous protease inhibitors, and requisite conversion from inactive precursor forms. Therefore, in these circumstances, it is not enough to know protease expression levels alone. We propose that global profiles of extracellular protease activity may emerge as a powerful functional tool for the molecular stratification of cancer. The Craik laboratory has developed a novel mass spectrometry-based screening technology that can identify the global substrate specificity and kinetic efficiency of proteases alone and in complex biological mixtures by employing a small, diverse library of rationally designed peptide substrates. This technology, referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), marks a significant breakthrough in protease profiling by allowing for the unbiased and simultaneous detection of all protease activities in a given sample. In this proposal, the Craik laboratory will partner with the Sali laboratory to develop and test computational models that classify cancer samples on the basis of protease specificity with the goal of building protease-activatable diagnostics for subtype-specific imaging. Global profiles of extracellular protease activity from increasingly complex breast and prostate cancer samples will be determined using the MSP-MS assay. In parallel, machine learning algorithms will be used to develop specificity-based classification models that will be correlated to known metrics for tumor aggressiveness. Sub-libraries of peptide sequences that represent the major classification groups identified will aid in designing protease-activatable imaging probes that will be tested experimentally for subtype selectivity. Probe cleavage sequences will be iteratively refined to improve selectivity through both incorporation of cleavage rates into the modeling strategy and peptide docking against the 3D structures of the target proteases. The new class of reagents developed will be applied to and further optimized against clinical correlations in the next phase of the project. We anticipate that our strategy for generating tailored diagnostics for the functional profiling of cancer will advance the identification and monitoring of disease as well as aid in cancer biomarker discovery.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advancements in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer require new technologies that can define disease at the molecular level. Proteases are a class of proteins that are essential molecular players in normal cellular function but also are responsible for the spread of aggressive cancers when their activities become unregulated. We are developing new computational models and screening strategies to design personalized diagnostics that target active proteases in different subtypes of cancer with the goal of improving cancer identification and informing treatment decision-making for patients.            ",Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer,8681246,R21CA186077,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell secretion', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug resistance', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'PC3 cell line', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteomics', 'Reagent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Markers', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2014,201953,0.03916298664108059
"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL.

"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and othe factors on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with -omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration of two mature informatics groups with long histories of developing open-source natural language processing (NLP) software (Apache cTAKES, caTIES and ODIE) to extend existing software with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic entities, and causal discourse). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. Three driving oncology projects led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, and Ovarian Cancer will drive development of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for a extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature o advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We propose research to enhance the ability of researchers to utilize data from unstructured medical records in their translational cancer research programs.

"Using medical informatics to follow-up a colorectal sessile serrated polyp cohort     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence suggests that sessile serrated polyps (SSPs), flat, colonic lesions with architectural abnormalities at the base of crypts and a serrated appearance, may be important precursors to colorectal cancer. Previously, advanced adenomas were the only known polyp precursors for colorectal cancer, and SSPs were clinically grouped with hyperplastic polyps, lesions routinely believed to have no malignant potential. Now, there is growing consensus that SSPs progress to cancer along the ""serrated pathway"". New guidelines were developed in 2012 recommending complete removal of SSPs and increased colorectal cancer surveillance in patients with a history of SSPs. However, these guidelines acknowledge that these new recommendations are largely based on cross-sectional data, with the only longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs limited by size (n=40). Therefore, the primary objective of this application is to gather preliminary data to estimate the risk of colorectal cancer in a large cohort of patients with clinically diagnosed SSPs. We will address the following specific aims: 1) compare the risk of subsequent colorectal cancer in patients who had SSPs diagnosed at an index colonoscopy to patients with advanced adenomas, and estimate the time to cancer progression in both polyp groups; 2) among those with SSPs at index colonoscopy, evaluate whether risk of incident colorectal cancer varies according to size and location of the index SSP. To accomplish these aims, we propose a cohort study of 2,250 patients evaluated via an index colonoscopy between 2003 and 2011 at the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic and diagnosed with SSPs (N=750) or advanced adenomas (N=1,500). Using University of Washington's established Microsoft Amalga data aggregation platform, which links electronic medical records data across different sources, we have already identified our study cohort. Additional medical informatics and natural language processing will be used to electronically extract data on patient characteristics, and index polyp size and location. Then, we will electronically follow-up patients for incident colorectal cancer through December 2012 by linking our study cohort to the Puget Sound Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Cancer Registry (SEER), a population based cancer registry covering western Washington State, including the catchment area for the University of Washington Medical Center Gastroenterology Clinic patient population. Cox regression models will be used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of colorectal cancer risk comparing patients with SSPs to those with advanced adenomas (Aim 1) and to estimate colorectal cancer risk between patients with different polyp characteristics among those with SSPs (Aim 2). This will be the largest longitudinal study of colorectal cancer risk in patients with SSPs to date and the first study in a colonoscopy-based cohort to estimate incidence of colorectal cancer in those with SSPs diagnosed though usual care in the clinical setting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study aims to determine the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with clinically diagnosed sessile serrated polyps. New research links these polyps to a subset of colorectal cancer that tends to be missed during cancer screening. Understanding the risk of colorectal cancer in patients with clinically diagnosed sessile serrated polyps will inform decisions about the management of these patients and ultimately improve the effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening.            ",Using medical informatics to follow-up a colorectal sessile serrated polyp cohort,8704474,R03CA186215,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biometry', 'Caliber', 'Catchment Area', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Histologic', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Incidence', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Polyps', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Screening for cancer', 'Serrated Adenoma', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Villous', 'Washington', 'adenoma', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'gastrointestinal', 'hazard', 'improved', 'indexing', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'patient population', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound', 'treatment as usual', 'tumor progression']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R03,2014,88000,0.06286495412178307
"Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer genomics resources are growing at an unprecedented pace. However, a comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome still remains a daunting challenge. This is in part due to the difficulties in visualizing, integrating, and analyzng cancer genomics data with current technologies. We propose to develop a cloud-based platform to empower researchers with the ability to host, visualize and analyze their own data. The platform is composed of a set of Cancer Analytics Virtual Machines (CAVMs). The main component of each CAVM is a data server which functions to store and serve user data to applications, such as the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, to provide data visualization. The second component is a modified Galaxy workflow system to provide data analysis capability. UCSC's suite of analysis tools for nextgen sequencing data analysis and pathway inference will be prepackaged with the system. The two components will be highly integrated to allow tightly coupled cycles of data visualization and analysis. The data server component will be modular such that it can provide data independently to applications besides the Cancer Browser and Galaxy. We will deliver virtual machine images that can be easily initiated in a commercial cloud such as Amazon, or can be installed within a user's own institution. The CAVM also functions as a way for users to Integrate with external large-scale databases. We will deliver a UCSC CAVM that other CAVM instances can connect to, to provide authorized data access from the UCSC cancer genomics data repository. The system allows the dynamic formation of new datasets composed of data slices from multiple sources. This ability to combine data into larger samples will provide the statistical power to allow discoveries that would otherwise not be possible. We aim to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the overhead of system configuration and software installation. Our tools will provide users the capability to access a cloud-based cluster computing environment, which will make sophisticated, computationally intensive analyses accessible to researchers who might not, have access to compute servers. The software platform we develop can be used by individual bench biologists, and also by large projects to serve data to individual users or to other projects. This design has the potential to form an expansive federated database accessible through the same software interface.         RELEVANCE: Currently, clinicians and bench biologists typically depend on external collaborators for data analysis. The proposed system will provide these scientists with data analysis and visualization methods that are both powerful and easy to use. This will accelerate research in the understanding and treatment of cancer, the second-leading cause of death in the U.S.              n/a","Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc",8735909,U24CA180951,"['Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Galaxy', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Update', 'Work', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'data hosting', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'empowered', 'federated computing', 'large-scale database', 'programs', 'repository', 'text searching', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web interface']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2014,674379,0.07196397447853094
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary It is estimated that there will be about 12,340 new cases of cervical cancer and those 4,030 women will die of this disease this year in the United States (American Cancer Society). Worldwide, invasive cervical cancer is an even greater problem and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in women. A method to accurately predict cervical cancer outcome prior to standard therapy would be critical for the early identification of patients with high risk of treatment failures. For these high-risk patients modified therapy could potentially be applied for improved patient survival. However, traditional clinic pathologic features, such as tumor grade and stage, have limited prognostic values in cervical cancer. Thus, new methods need to be developed for improved prognostic performance. In this proposed research, we will test the hypothesis that the expression signature of multiple selected microRNAs can reliably predict the outcome of cervical cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered family of small non- coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers to predict cancer therapy outcomes. However, the prognostic value of miRNAs in cervical cancer has not been investigated. The major goal of this research is to build a miRNA-based model to robustly predict cervical cancer outcome. Our preliminary analysis has identified two miRNAs that are predictive of cervical cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all cervix-related miRNAs in a large number of cervical tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of cervical cancer.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RELEVANCE Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women worldwide, leading to about 300,000 deaths each year. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized cervical cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non- coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.            ",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR CERVICAL CANCER,8690410,R21CA177902,"['American Cancer Society', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cervix Neoplasms', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Associated Process', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'high risk', 'improved', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2014,198849,0.06999786611792896
"Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large tumor exome sequencing projects have identified a very large number of mutations whose cancer relevance is not yet understood. To begin to address this need, our team has produced two web applications for high-throughput computational analysis of cancer mutations: the Cancer-Related Analysis of VAriants Toolkit (CRAVAT) and the Mutation Position Imaging Toolbox (MuPIT). CRAVAT accepts millions of mutations in a single batch upload and maps mutations from genomic coordinates to annotated transcripts and proteins. MuPIT currently accepts batch uploads of up to 2500 SNVs and maps from genomic coordinates onto X-ray crystal structures of proteins from Protein Data Bank (PDB). We propose to combine and harden CRAVAT and MuPIT into a single web application, in which we will substantially improve the tools, user interface, software infrastructure, integration with external data resources and tools used by the community, and support for protected data. The scope of all tools in the web application will be broadened to handle analysis of the full range of small-scale mutation consequence types found in cancer exomes.  CRAVAT analysis identifies mutations most likely to have deleterious impact on protein function and those that are most likely to confer a selective advantage to cancer cells (drivers), using classifiers developed by our team. Classifier scores are supplemented with annotations, including population allele frequencies, previous occurrence in tumor tissue types, and gene functional categories, enabling filtering (e.g. removing polymorphisms) and prioritization. Gene-level annotation and scoring, by aggregation of classifier scores from mutations in a cohort is also provided.  MuPIT maps mutations from genomic positions onto to protein structures and provides interactive viewing of mutations in the context of protein structure, and in relation to a variety of annotations. To enable prioritization of interesting mutations and genes, the application provides a preview describing each structure and all available annotations (e.g., binding sites, experimental mutagenesis results, polymorphic and disease- associated variants that have been previously documented). After selecting a PDB of interest, the user is led to an interactive visualization page. An enhanced Jmol applet displays all SNVs mapped onto the structure. Frequently, many SNVs in the input list can be mapped onto a single structure, revealing clustering patterns around key functional sites.  Based only on word-of-mouth, since the debut of the two applications in August 2012, CRAVAT has been utilized by 129 unique users from 39 countries, and it has analyzed 1,136 submitted jobs, totaling 27.9 million mutations. MuPIT has been utilized by 242 unique users from 25 countries, with 720 submitted jobs. (Source: Google Analytics).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will harden and develop web applications for the cancer genomics community to interpret small-scale mutations in cancer exomes. They are designed to handle very large number of mutations and to provide analysis targeted at researchers who are not bioinformatics experts. The work will contribute to understanding of the genetic complexity and heterogeneity of tumors and assist in discovery of new approaches for cancer prognosis and treatments.

"Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wnt signaling is one of the most common pathways linked to carcinogenesis in the intestine. The transcription factors that mediate Wnt signals are members of the Lymphoid Enhancer Factor/T Cell Factor (LEF/TCF) family. This four-member family is complex in that there are full-length activating forms, truncated dominant negative forms, and alternatively spliced isoforms that modify Wnt target gene recognition. TCF-1 and TCF-4 are the two family members expressed in the epithelial crypt compartment of the intestine. Normally, TCF-1 is expressed as a dominant negative isoform and it counteracts the action of TCF-4 which is expressed as a Wnt-mediating, active isoform. This pattern changes in cancer because TCF-1 expression switches to a full-length, Wnt mediating form. We have discovered a second DNA binding domain in TCF-1 and TCF-4 isoforms called the C-clamp. We have shown that the C-clamp is important for regulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells. We have also identified Wnts that trigger TCF-1 export in colon cancer cells. Export of TCF-1 leaves the C-clamp form of TCF-4 in the nucleus to mediate aberrant Wnt signaling. Three aims are proposed for this project. First, the extracellular Wnts and intracellular components that direct TCF-1 nuclear export will be defined (Aim1). Second, the biological impact of export will be defined in colon cancer cells and colon cancer initiating 3D cultures (Aim2). Third, the DNA binding specificities and target gene selection of C-clamp forms of TCF-1 and TCF-4 will be defined through genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-Seq), high-throughput protein binding microarrays, and in vitro biochemical analysis (Aim3). The overall goal is to define the mechanisms behind changes in TCF expression in colon carcinogenesis, and to define how extracellular Wnts and DNA binding specificities of TCFs influence aberrant signaling in colon cancer cells with stabilized ?-catenin.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression. Wnt signaling is mediated by the TCF transcription factors and we have discovered their activities and expression to be different in colon cancer versus normal colon tissue. This project investigates basic mechanisms of TCF localization and gene targeting and asks how differences in these attributes contribute to the cancer cell phenotype.

"Advanced Development of TIES-Enhancing Access to Tissue for Cancer Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Archived human tissues are an essential resource for translational research. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from cancer patients are used in a wide range of assays, including RT-PCR, SNP profiling, multiplex biomarkers, imaging biomarkers, targeted exome, whole exome, and whole genome sequencing. Remainder FFPE tissues generated during patient care are 'retrospective'; use of these tissues under specific conditions does not require consent. For personalized medicine researchers, these specimens are vital resources enabling biomarker validation, detailed molecular analysis, and systems modeling before application is made to individual patients. But access to these human tissues is often a rate limiting factor in cancer research. We propose advanced development of the TIES software to (1) increase institutional capacity for using FFPE to support molecular characterization of human tumors, (2) increase access to tissues within cancer centers, and (3) improve the ability to share tissues and associated phenotype data among cancer centers.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This work proposes the development of a software system that will enhance the ability of cancer researchers to find and use human tissues and accompanying electronic data for scientific research.

"Virtual Fly-Over Colonoscopy System for Clinical Test-SBIR Phase 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Yet, if polyps are detected and removed early, colorectal cancer is largely preventable. Although optical colonoscopy (OC), the current gold standard, detects more than 90% of colorectal neoplasms; it is invasive and can be uncomfortable, inconvenient, and perceived as undesirable by patients. Furthermore, even experienced endoscopists may have difficulty reaching the cecum, resulting in incomplete visualizations of the colon. As a consequence, virtual colonoscopy (VC) has emerged as an alternative to OC. During VC, a virtual camera is used to view the internal walls of a virtual colon, reconstructed from CT scans of the abdominal cavity. However, current VC systems have had limited clinical appeal, as they are limited to specific types of polyps, may generate a large number of false positives, or have poor detection rates for significant polyps in the size range of 5-9 mm. The new technology we propose to commercialize through this SBIR work is a game changing, patented, visualization technique for VC, called the ""virtual fly-over"" technique. The technique is sensitive, effective, and efficient for detecting colon polyps. The overall objective of this proposal is to complete the development and validation of a novel visualization technique for virtual colonoscopy, which was patented by the University of Louisville. The hypothesis is that the new visualization technique will enable better viewing of the complex colonic topology, and hence a better capability to detect polyps, especially those that may be hidden behind haustral folds. The current prototype has been utilized to evaluate twenty clinical datasets, with excellent results. However, artifact removal and user friendly features must be incorporated prior to Phase II, in which the technology will be utilized in a larg scale clinical validation trial leading to a commercial product. Also, we propose to (1) generate more convincing preliminary data in a pilot study of 160 datasets, and (2) introduce several phantom polyps, in the size range of 5-9 mm, into the clinical datasets, in order to provide statistical significance of the technology's effectiveness. The phantom polyps will be placed in traditionally difficult-to-analyze positions, which pose significant detection problems for both OC and current VC methods. According to the literature, current OC methods result in a 61-91% (average 80%) viewing of the Colon. The University of Louisville's work in the ""fly-through VC method"", which mimics classic OC, results in 93.4 percent viewing, and the new ""fly-over"" method results in 97.5% percent viewing. Even more important is the improved point of view (""eye-in-the-sky""), the lack of optical distortion, and enhanced CAD functionality that will increase polyp recognition dramatically, especially when detecting small colon polyps, polyps hidden behind haustral folds, and polyps in folded colonic segments at anatomical inflection points. We anticipate the overall improvement in the ability to visualize difficult polyps to be upwards of 30% compared to today's methods, and we are excited about commercializing this technology with the University of Louisville.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US with only approximately 50% of the eligible population take advantage of current screening methods. The importance of this proposed technology is the early detection of colon cancer, in an acceptable manner that the general population will agree to, and without the associated morbidity of sedation that is required for the vast majority of endoscopic colonoscopy. We believe our technology has the potential to serve as a foundation for a huge step forward in automating and facilitating large scale screening of human colons, providing a more effective and much more acceptable method to the general population, than the currently invasive optical colonoscopy, which 50 % of the population still refuses to undergo.

"Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cervical cancer prevention processes are rapidly transforming. Changes in guidelines, and resulting changes in practice, stem from breakthroughs in basic research on cervical cancer and technological advances in testing, diagnosis, and prevention. For example discovery of the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical carcinogenesis has led to         development of HPV vaccines and recommendations for their use in the general public. As cervical cancer prevention practices change, we face widening gaps in our knowledge about the impact of these changes on women's health, that is, the balance of risk and harms affected by newly recommended screening intervals, and how this balance differs for vaccinated and unvaccinated women. We also need more information about barriers to screening uptake and adherence to guidelines screening intervals. To address these gaps, we propose supplementing our Studying Colorectal Cancer Effectiveness of Screening Strategies (SuCCESS) PROSPR Research Center with a Cervical Cancer Unit that will collect population-based data and work with the PROSPR network to guide studies of the cervical cancer screening process. Our study team, located at Group Health Research Institute, has access to extensive data from Group Health, a health care and coverage system in Washington State. Multilevel data are available from patients (e.g., characteristics, screening dates, cancer outcomes), providers (e.g., specialty), and facilities that include both health system owned-and-operated clinics and contracted community affiliates. Group Health members represent a diverse population of patients who receive care under a range of insurance coverage programs available in the US, ranging from Medicare and Medicaid to new plans offered beginning January 1, 2014 under the Affordable Care Act. Our study team is well positioned to carry out this proposed work.

"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"Second generation sequencing and analysis for cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kevin Squire is a PhD in Electrical Engineering and former Computer Science professor with a strong interest in bioinformatics and human genetics. To this end, he joined Dr. Stanley F. Nelson's laboratory as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Human Genetics at UCLA one year ago, in order to retrain in bioinformatics and sequencing. Kevin's background in machine learning gives him a good foundation for a career in bioinformatics. What he needs, and what obtaining this grant will give him, is a good background in basic biology, biochemistry, and genetics, in order to better understand the biological processes behind the data he is working with. Kevin explorations in genetics have inspired him to make his career in this field. He hopes to gain a much better understanding of biology in order to ask and answer research questions relevant to the biology of cancer using second (and later) generation sequencing and through the use and development of relevant tools and analysis. As part of the research development plan, Kevin will complete a didactic coursework component in the first 2 years, to fill in the gaps in biology and bioinformatics in his background. During and after that, his research will focus on giving him a better understanding the genetics of cancer, attempting to answer relevant research questions from high throughput genomic sequencing data, through the use and creation of sequence analysis tools and other bioinformatics tools. Through his coursework and research, Kevin will attain the necessary skills to become an independent researcher in bioinformatics and genetics.

"An integrated approach to dissect the functional network of large non-coding RNA     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent studies revealed that the human genome encodes thousands of lncRNAs with little protein-coding capacity. LncRNAs were shown to play important roles in cancer and are potentially a new class of therapeutic targets for cancer. However, the function of the vast majority of lncRNAs in cancer remains unknown. LncRNA function often depends on its physical interactions with protein complexes. They can also influence the abundance of other mRNAs that are targeted by the same microRNAs by competing for microRNA binding, i.e., serving as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Advances in genomic technologies, especially those based on next generation sequencing (NGS), provide unparalleled opportunities to characterize the functional networks of lncRNA in cancer. However, analysis and integration of different types of genomic datasets to generate testable hypotheses is challenging, and systematic approaches to characterize lncRNA function in cancer are lacking. This application describes the development of computational methods and integrative genomic strategies for systematically dissecting the functional network of lncRNA in cancer, and a combination of computational and experimental approaches to unravel several important functional networks of lncRNA in prostate cancer. Specifically, it will (1) develop a computational method for repurposing the publically available array-based data to interrogate lncRNA expression in tumor samples and utilize an integrative genomic strategy to predict lncRNAs that may be important for tumorigenesis/tumor suppression in prostate cancer via analysis of lncRNA expression profiles, clinical information and somatic genomic alteration profiles of tumor samples, (2) identify the lncRNAs that are associated with EZH2 or direct transcriptional targets of EZH2 repression that are important for prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression, and (3) identify the ceRNAs of AR and PTEN that mediate prostate tumorigenesis or tumor suppression. In addition to its scientific proposal, this application proposes a comprehensive training program for preparing an independent investigator in the fields of computational genomics, non-coding RNA and cancer, who develops cutting-edge computational methods, and uses a combination of computational and experimental approaches to understand structure- function relationship of non-coding RNA and the function of non-coding RNA and RNA-protein interaction in cancer. While the candidate of this application has received extensive training in biophysics, statistics, machine learning and computational genomics, this career development award will allow him to develop his experimental skills, especially those next-generation sequencing-based techniques and molecular biology experiments in human cell lines. Dr. Liu, Professor of Biostatistics and Computational Biology and Dr. Brown, Professor of Medicine will mentor the candidate in the excellent training environment of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, a part of Harvard Medical School community. A committee of experienced computational and cancer biologists will also advise him on both scientific research and career development.              PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is to decipher lncRNA function in cancer using a combination of novel computational methods and high-throughput experimental technologies. The proposed research will result in publically available bioinformatic resources for studying lncRNA function in cancer, a greater understanding of lncRNA function in prostate cancer, and will help to discover novel therapeutic target of lncRNA for treating prostate cancer.               The written critiques and criteria scores of individual reviewers are provided in essentially unedited form in the ""Critique"" section below.

"Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of cancer genomics, combined with increased understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenesis, has stimulated hope that treatment will improve by becoming more targeted and individualized in nature. Cancer genomics studies established a number of critical cancer genes, leading to a number of successful targeted therapies (e.g. Gleevec, Herceptin and Plexxikon). Despite these successes, most cancers do not have a targeted therapy and when one exists, response is highly variable, even among patients that share the targeted mutation and tumor type. To move cancer into the era of personalized therapies, it becomes important to identify the alterations driving tumor progression in each tumor, determine the network that links these aberrations, and identify factors that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. As projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) amass cancer cell genomes at a breathtaking pace, a staggering genetic complexity is revealed. To interpret cancer genomes, a key computational challenge is to separate the wheat from the chaff and define both what are the key alterations likely to be functionally driving cancer and then, after defining such genes, begin to identify mechanisms of action and therapeutic implications. Leveraging components from our published methods, CONEXIC (Akavia et.al Cell 2010) and LirNet (Lee et.al, PLOS Gen 2009), we will develop machine-learning algorithms that integrate cancer genomic data to do just that. We will apply the methods we develop to melanoma, glioblastoma, ovarian, breast and colon cancer and experimentally follow up on our computational findings, towards a better understanding of each of these deadly cancers. The approaches developed in this grant will accelerate discovery to rapidly extract the maximal value from modern genomic studies and help carry cancer genomics from the diagnostic to the therapeutic realm.          This work aims to develop methods that help dissect the genetic complexity of individual cancers. For each tumor we aim to identify which mutations arm a cell with the abilities to abnormally grow or evade drug treatment, providing a foundation of tools towards personalized cancer treatment. We will apply these methods for discovery in some of the most aggressive cancers that currently lack good therapeutic solutions including glioblastoma, ovarian cancer and melanoma.

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transcription factor p53 is a central tumor suppressor protein that controls DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. About half of human cancers have p53 mutations, and restoring p53 function in advanced tumors leads to tumor regression. Significantly, the large majority of these tumors produce full-length p53 proteins that have lost their tumor suppressor function due to single amino acid changes. Therefore, an attractive new approach to systemic cancer therapy is pharmacological reactivation of p53 cancer mutants. Reactivation of p53 cancer mutants is feasible because we and others have shown that introducing additional mutations (second-site suppressor mutations) can restore activity to the otherwise inactive p53 cancer mutants. In addition a few promising small molecule drug leads with unknown mechanisms of action have been reported to reactivate p53 cancer mutants. The challenge is to understand structural changes that lead to reactivation of p53 cancer mutants and to induce such changes through small molecules. This is a complex problem due to the diversity of clinically relevant single amino acid changes found in p53 cancer mutants.  We propose computational approaches based on machine learning that are supported by high-throughput biological strategies. We use novel saturation mutagenesis approaches to catalogue p53 rescue mutations for the 50 most relevant p53 mutants found in human cancer. The genetic data are used in an active learning scheme to train a computational classifier, that is based on modeled atom-level structural features, to predict which structural changes lead to reactivation of any given p53 cancer mutant. We further propose to apply this improved computational classifier to discover small molecules that induce similar structural changes and test these pre-selected compounds in a biological assay for p53 cancer mutant reactivation. Data obtained from these in vivo experiments will be used to further improve the computational predictions for small molecules.  In summary, we use genetic functional data to train a structure-based classifier to predict p53 activity based on an internal representation of modeled structural changes. The classifier will then be used to predict reactivation of p53 cancer mutants by small molecules with the aim to identify cancer drug leads. The proposed research has high impact on biomedical research and public health. About 250,000 US deaths yearly are due to tumors with full length but mutated and inactive p53. The long-term goal of this research, a drug that reactivates mutant p53, could prevent or delay these deaths.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the single most important protein to prevent cancer, and half of all human tumors produce a defective p53 protein. Pharmacological reactivation of the defective p53 proteins could potentially prevent or delay over 250,000 cancer deaths yearly in the US alone. This proposal uses genetic strategies and computational approaches to predict p53 reactivation by small molecules that can eventually develop into cancer drugs.

"SPORE in Skin Cancer The incidence of melanoma has risen dramatically in recent years, but no therapy has improved overall survival for the majority of patients with unresectable metastatic disease. The University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) Melanoma and Skin Cancer Program (MSCP) will continue to conduct a Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) to improve our understanding of molecular and immunologic mechanisms of cancer progression and to validate prognostic and predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment of advanced melanoma and cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). Of our 4 Projects, 1 is continued from the prior funding period, and 3 new projects have been derived from developmental research conducted in the last period; 1 of the prior SPORE projects will be continued with independent ROI funding. Our highly integrated approach leverages complementary expertise in melanoma, oncology, dermatology, immunology, biostatistics, bioinformatics, machine learning, genomics, proteomics, and biomarker discovery to test hypotheses central to the improvement of therapeutic outcome in skin cancers. Regardless of clinical outcomes, these Projects will also generate urgently needed mechanistic data to inform development of new therapeutic strategies and pathways through which to monitor relapse and progression. Our 4 Projects will evaluate: (1) the prognostic and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory response and markers of immune suppression in relation to ipilimumab and interferon (IFN)¿ adjuvant therapy (leveraging an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group-led adjuvant trial); (2) an engineered, 3-antigen dendritic cell vaccine and IFN¿ boost in patients with metastatic melanoma; (3) the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib modulation of immunotherapy with IFN¿2b in patients with metastatic melanoma; and (4) an entirely new personalized microneedle vaccination technology in patients with melanoma and CTCL. The Administrative Core (A) coordinates the clinical research and provides scientific and fiscal oversight of the entire SPORE. The Biospecimen Core (B) is housed in the UPCI Immunologic Monitoring and Cellular Products Laboratory, where all tissue banking, biospecimen processing, and immune assays are conducted. The Biostatistics Core (C) and Informatics Core (D) support all projects with data analysis and management, respectively. We will continue to solicit, review, and fund applications for the career development and developmental research programs, which in the prior funding period led to the design of a new full project in this application (Project 3)  and the promotion of career development recipients to co-investigators and a project leader. The goal of this application is to use a multi-disciplinary approach to improve outcomes in skin cancer and in particular, metastatic melanoma, a disease with a 15% 5-year survival rate. We will improve treatment and outcomes for skin cancer patients by identifying new ways to treat the disease based on the biology of the individual patient's tumor and new biomarkers that predict risk and response to therapy to prevent recurrence based on an individual patient's genetics and the tumor impact upon the microenvironment.",SPORE in Skin Cancer,8548580,P50CA121973,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Study', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Antigens', 'Apoptotic', 'BRAF gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Melanoma', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dendritic Cell Vaccine', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Housing', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Situ', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interferon-alpha', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Informatics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Carcinoma', 'Specialized Program of Research Excellence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Cell Lymphoma', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Banking', 'Tissue Banks', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute', 'Unresectable', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Vector', 'base', 'career development', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'data management', 'design', 'dosage', 'effective therapy', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory marker', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'melanoma', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'novel vaccines', 'oncology', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P50,2013,2150500,0.03268386148222658
"Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer genomics resources are growing at an unprecedented pace. However, a comprehensive analysis of the cancer genome still remains a daunting challenge. This is in part due to the difficulties in visualizing, integrating, and analyzng cancer genomics data with current technologies. We propose to develop a cloud-based platform to empower researchers with the ability to host, visualize and analyze their own data. The platform is composed of a set of Cancer Analytics Virtual Machines (CAVMs). The main component of each CAVM is a data server which functions to store and serve user data to applications, such as the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, to provide data visualization. The second component is a modified Galaxy workflow system to provide data analysis capability. UCSC's suite of analysis tools for nextgen sequencing data analysis and pathway inference will be prepackaged with the system. The two components will be highly integrated to allow tightly coupled cycles of data visualization and analysis. The data server component will be modular such that it can provide data independently to applications besides the Cancer Browser and Galaxy. We will deliver virtual machine images that can be easily initiated in a commercial cloud such as Amazon, or can be installed within a user's own institution. The CAVM also functions as a way for users to Integrate with external large-scale databases. We will deliver a UCSC CAVM that other CAVM instances can connect to, to provide authorized data access from the UCSC cancer genomics data repository. The system allows the dynamic formation of new datasets composed of data slices from multiple sources. This ability to combine data into larger samples will provide the statistical power to allow discoveries that would otherwise not be possible. We aim to eliminate, or significantly reduce, the overhead of system configuration and software installation. Our tools will provide users the capability to access a cloud-based cluster computing environment, which will make sophisticated, computationally intensive analyses accessible to researchers who might not, have access to compute servers. The software platform we develop can be used by individual bench biologists, and also by large projects to serve data to individual users or to other projects. This design has the potential to form an expansive federated database accessible through the same software interface.         RELEVANCE: Currently, clinicians and bench biologists typically depend on external collaborators for data analysis. The proposed system will provide these scientists with data analysis and visualization methods that are both powerful and easy to use. This will accelerate research in the understanding and treatment of cancer, the second-leading cause of death in the U.S.              n/a","Cloud Based Resource for Data Hosting, Visualization and Analysis Using UCSC Canc",8607380,U24CA180951,"['Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Galaxy', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'cluster computing', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'empowered', 'federated computing', 'large-scale database', 'programs', 'repository', 'text searching', 'tool', 'virtual', 'web interface']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2013,621154,0.07196397447853094
"Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations  PROJECT SUMMARY  Large tumor exome sequencing projects have identified a very large number of mutations whose cancer relevance is not yet understood. To begin to address this need, our team has produced two web applications for high-throughput computational analysis of cancer mutations: the Cancer-Related Analysis of VAriants Toolkit (CRAVAT) and the Mutation Position Imaging Toolbox (MuPIT). CRAVAT accepts millions of mutations in a single batch upload and maps mutations from genomic coordinates to annotated transcripts and proteins. MuPIT currently accepts batch uploads of up to 2500 SNVs and maps from genomic coordinates onto X-ray crystal structures of proteins from Protein Data Bank (PDB). We propose to combine and harden CRAVAT and MuPIT into a single web application, in which we will substantially improve the tools, user interface, software infrastructure, integration with external data resources and tools used by the community, and support for protected data. The scope of all tools in the web application will be broadened to handle analysis of the full range of small-scale mutation consequence types found in cancer exomes.  CRAVAT analysis identifies mutations most likely to have deleterious impact on protein function and those that are most likely to confer a selective advantage to cancer cells (drivers), using classifiers developed by our team. Classifier scores are supplemented with annotations, including population allele frequencies, previous occurrence in tumor tissue types, and gene functional categories, enabling filtering (e.g. removing polymorphisms) and prioritization. Gene-level annotation and scoring, by aggregation of classifier scores from mutations in a cohort is also provided.  MuPIT maps mutations from genomic positions onto to protein structures and provides interactive viewing of mutations in the context of protein structure, and in relation to a variety of annotations. To enable prioritization of interesting mutations and genes, the application provides a preview describing each structure and all available annotations (e.g., binding sites, experimental mutagenesis results, polymorphic and disease- associated variants that have been previously documented). After selecting a PDB of interest, the user is led to an interactive visualization page. An enhanced Jmol applet displays all SNVs mapped onto the structure. Frequently, many SNVs in the input list can be mapped onto a single structure, revealing clustering patterns around key functional sites.  Based only on word-of-mouth, since the debut of the two applications in August 2012, CRAVAT has been utilized by 129 unique users from 39 countries, and it has analyzed 1,136 submitted jobs, totaling 27.9 million mutations. MuPIT has been utilized by 242 unique users from 25 countries, with 720 submitted jobs. (Source: Google Analytics). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work will harden and develop web applications for the cancer genomics community to interpret small-scale mutations in cancer exomes. They are designed to handle very large number of mutations and to provide analysis targeted at researchers who are not bioinformatics experts. The work will contribute to understanding of the genetic complexity and heterogeneity of tumors and assist in discovery of new approaches for cancer prognosis and treatments.            ",Informatics Tools for High-throughput Analysis of Cancer Mutations,8606625,U01CA180956,"['Address', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Ensure', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Molecular', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Analysis', 'Occupations', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privacy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Qualifying', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer classification', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'cohort', 'data exchange', 'design', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial alkaline proteinase inhibitor', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel strategies', 'prognostic', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'web interface', 'web services']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2013,289971,0.018007162165043247
"Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wnt signaling is one of the most common pathways linked to carcinogenesis in the intestine. The transcription factors that mediate Wnt signals are members of the Lymphoid Enhancer Factor/T Cell Factor (LEF/TCF) family. This four-member family is complex in that there are full-length activating forms, truncated dominant negative forms, and alternatively spliced isoforms that modify Wnt target gene recognition. TCF-1 and TCF-4 are the two family members expressed in the epithelial crypt compartment of the intestine. Normally, TCF-1 is expressed as a dominant negative isoform and it counteracts the action of TCF-4 which is expressed as a Wnt-mediating, active isoform. This pattern changes in cancer because TCF-1 expression switches to a full-length, Wnt mediating form. We have discovered a second DNA binding domain in TCF-1 and TCF-4 isoforms called the C-clamp. We have shown that the C-clamp is important for regulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells. We have also identified Wnts that trigger TCF-1 export in colon cancer cells. Export of TCF-1 leaves the C-clamp form of TCF-4 in the nucleus to mediate aberrant Wnt signaling. Three aims are proposed for this project. First, the extracellular Wnts and intracellular components that direct TCF-1 nuclear export will be defined (Aim1). Second, the biological impact of export will be defined in colon cancer cells and colon cancer initiating 3D cultures (Aim2). Third, the DNA binding specificities and target gene selection of C-clamp forms of TCF-1 and TCF-4 will be defined through genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-Seq), high-throughput protein binding microarrays, and in vitro biochemical analysis (Aim3). The overall goal is to define the mechanisms behind changes in TCF expression in colon carcinogenesis, and to define how extracellular Wnts and DNA binding specificities of TCFs influence aberrant signaling in colon cancer cells with stabilized ?-catenin.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression. Wnt signaling is mediated by the TCF transcription factors and we have discovered their activities and expression to be different in colon cancer versus normal colon tissue. This project investigates basic mechanisms of TCF localization and gene targeting and asks how differences in these attributes contribute to the cancer cell phenotype.

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES Abstract We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions. Narrative This grant will fund the further development and evaluation of a system that takes identified clinical documents and converts them into de-identified, concept-coded, structured data. The system enables researchers to access remainder tissues and clinical report data for research purposes within and across institution. This project is important because it will greatly increase the access of researchers to important data and materials while maintaining patient privacy. n/a",Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES,8403841,R01CA132672,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Center', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Ductal', 'Electronic Mail', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operating System', 'Pathology Report', 'Performance', 'Private Hospitals', 'Process', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'University Hospitals', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'clinical phenotype', 'computer human interaction', 'ductal breast carcinoma', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'metathesaurus', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'portability', 'repository', 'software development', 'software systems', 'systems research', 'tool', 'usability']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2013,286637,-0.003955022231061882
"Advanced Development of TIES-Enhancing Access to Tissue for Cancer Research     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Archived human tissues are an essential resource for translational research. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from cancer patients are used in a wide range of assays, including RT-PCR, SNP profiling, multiplex biomarkers, imaging biomarkers, targeted exome, whole exome, and whole genome sequencing. Remainder FFPE tissues generated during patient care are 'retrospective'; use of these tissues under specific conditions does not require consent. For personalized medicine researchers, these specimens are vital resources enabling biomarker validation, detailed molecular analysis, and systems modeling before application is made to individual patients. But access to these human tissues is often a rate limiting factor in cancer research. We propose advanced development of the TIES software to (1) increase institutional capacity for using FFPE to support molecular characterization of human tumors, (2) increase access to tissues within cancer centers, and (3) improve the ability to share tissues and associated phenotype data among cancer centers.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   This work proposes the development of a software system that will enhance the ability of cancer researchers to find and use human tissues and accompanying electronic data for scientific research.

"Enhancing tumor vascular damage with gold nanoparticles aided radiation therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent developments in anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting therapies as well as hypofractionated radiotherapy have shown the great potential of tumor vasculature as a therapeutic target for cancer medicine. We have an original idea for using targeted gold nanoparticles as vascular disruptive agents (VDA) in conjunction with clinical megavoltage photon beams. Unlike competing proposals, we recognize that gold nanoparticles tend to accumulate in, and can even be targeted for, tumor blood vessels and that these structures may be more important for anti-cancer therapy than clonogenic cell death. Due to the short distance traveled by x-ray induced photoelectrons, the endothelial cells of the tumor will receive a sizable boost in dose, even for clinical megavoltage photon irradiation. We are proposing a therapy that would be highly compatible with current clinical practice and could offer a substantial clinical benefit. Upon the successful completion of the aims, we will have demonstrated the validity of two underlying premises: 1) gold nanoparticles can be effectively, and safely, targeted to the tumor endothelium, and 2) the incidence of endothelial cell apoptosis during radiotherapy will be highly correlated to the proximity and local concentrations of gold nanoparticles.           The goal of this project is the improvement of cancer therapy by employing gold nanoparticles, specifically targeted to tumor blood vessels, during radiation therapy. These nanoparticles will give off an extra radiation dose to their immediate surroundings during therapeutic irradiation. The ensuing collapse of the tumor vasculature could lead to large scale cancer cell death and potentially halt metastasis.

"Virtual Fly-Over Colonoscopy System for Clinical Test-SBIR Phase 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Yet, if polyps are detected and removed early, colorectal cancer is largely preventable. Although optical colonoscopy (OC), the current gold standard, detects more than 90% of colorectal neoplasms; it is invasive and can be uncomfortable, inconvenient, and perceived as undesirable by patients. Furthermore, even experienced endoscopists may have difficulty reaching the cecum, resulting in incomplete visualizations of the colon. As a consequence, virtual colonoscopy (VC) has emerged as an alternative to OC. During VC, a virtual camera is used to view the internal walls of a virtual colon, reconstructed from CT scans of the abdominal cavity. However, current VC systems have had limited clinical appeal, as they are limited to specific types of polyps, may generate a large number of false positives, or have poor detection rates for significant polyps in the size range of 5-9 mm. The new technology we propose to commercialize through this SBIR work is a game changing, patented, visualization technique for VC, called the ""virtual fly-over"" technique. The technique is sensitive, effective, and efficient for detecting colon polyps. The overall objective of this proposal is to complete the development and validation of a novel visualization technique for virtual colonoscopy, which was patented by the University of Louisville. The hypothesis is that the new visualization technique will enable better viewing of the complex colonic topology, and hence a better capability to detect polyps, especially those that may be hidden behind haustral folds. The current prototype has been utilized to evaluate twenty clinical datasets, with excellent results. However, artifact removal and user friendly features must be incorporated prior to Phase II, in which the technology will be utilized in a larg scale clinical validation trial leading to a commercial product. Also, we propose to (1) generate more convincing preliminary data in a pilot study of 160 datasets, and (2) introduce several phantom polyps, in the size range of 5-9 mm, into the clinical datasets, in order to provide statistical significance of the technology's effectiveness. The phantom polyps will be placed in traditionally difficult-to-analyze positions, which pose significant detection problems for both OC and current VC methods. According to the literature, current OC methods result in a 61-91% (average 80%) viewing of the Colon. The University of Louisville's work in the ""fly-through VC method"", which mimics classic OC, results in 93.4 percent viewing, and the new ""fly-over"" method results in 97.5% percent viewing. Even more important is the improved point of view (""eye-in-the-sky""), the lack of optical distortion, and enhanced CAD functionality that will increase polyp recognition dramatically, especially when detecting small colon polyps, polyps hidden behind haustral folds, and polyps in folded colonic segments at anatomical inflection points. We anticipate the overall improvement in the ability to visualize difficult polyps to be upwards of 30% compared to today's methods, and we are excited about commercializing this technology with the University of Louisville.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US with only approximately 50% of the eligible population take advantage of current screening methods. The importance of this proposed technology is the early detection of colon cancer, in an acceptable manner that the general population will agree to, and without the associated morbidity of sedation that is required for the vast majority of endoscopic colonoscopy. We believe our technology has the potential to serve as a foundation for a huge step forward in automating and facilitating large scale screening of human colons, providing a more effective and much more acceptable method to the general population, than the currently invasive optical colonoscopy, which 50 % of the population still refuses to undergo.            ",Virtual Fly-Over Colonoscopy System for Clinical Test-SBIR Phase 1,8586142,R43CA179911,"['Abdominal Cavity', 'Area', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cecum', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colon', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Complex', 'Computed Tomographic Colonography', 'Computer Graphics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Eye', 'Flying body movement', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Helicopter', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Kentucky', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Medial', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Optical Methods', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polyps', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Reading', 'Rivers', 'Science', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Sedation procedure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'design', 'experience', 'fly', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NCI,"KENTUCKY IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES, LLC",R43,2013,148821,0.028985787293029672
"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the Hispanic population is growing significantly which is of great concern. In Hispanics, the viral infection progresses more rapidly when compared with Caucasian patients and the treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Disturbingly, current treatments seem to be less effective on Hispanics. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabolomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from patients. We will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal component analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create our first order biomarker panels. In phase two, we will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). Dr. Spratt's research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve our SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer vs non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs. n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,8308938,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2012,133197,0.03308356577320242
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies. The UCSC-Buck Institute Cancer Genome Data Analysis Center aims to analyze the TCGA project data to  identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathway signatures that can be used in  clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) candidate gene targets for the  development of novel therapeutics. Insights learned from this endeavor will advance the knowledge of  cancer and human biology, and will enhance cancer treatment and prevention by personalizing it to the  genetic background of the patient and the mutations present in the tumor.",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals¿ cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.              Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity.

"Second generation sequencing and analysis for cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Kevin Squire is a PhD in Electrical Engineering and former Computer Science professor with a strong interest in bioinformatics and human genetics. To this end, he joined Dr. Stanley F. Nelson's laboratory as a Postdoctoral Fellow in Human Genetics at UCLA one year ago, in order to retrain in bioinformatics and sequencing. Kevin's background in machine learning gives him a good foundation for a career in bioinformatics. What he needs, and what obtaining this grant will give him, is a good background in basic biology, biochemistry, and genetics, in order to better understand the biological processes behind the data he is working with. Kevin explorations in genetics have inspired him to make his career in this field. He hopes to gain a much better understanding of biology in order to ask and answer research questions relevant to the biology of cancer using second (and later) generation sequencing and through the use and development of relevant tools and analysis. As part of the research development plan, Kevin will complete a didactic coursework component in the first 2 years, to fill in the gaps in biology and bioinformatics in his background. During and after that, his research will focus on giving him a better understanding the genetics of cancer, attempting to answer relevant research questions from high throughput genomic sequencing data, through the use and creation of sequence analysis tools and other bioinformatics tools. Through his coursework and research, Kevin will attain the necessary skills to become an independent researcher in bioinformatics and genetics.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer is a genetic disease, caused by mutations in DNA and other genetic changes which affect how cells work.

"Integrative Cancer Genomics: Drivers, Pathways and Drugs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The emergence of cancer genomics, combined with increased understanding of the molecular basis of oncogenesis, has stimulated hope that treatment will improve by becoming more targeted and individualized in nature. Cancer genomics studies established a number of critical cancer genes, leading to a number of successful targeted therapies (e.g. Gleevec, Herceptin and Plexxikon). Despite these successes, most cancers do not have a targeted therapy and when one exists, response is highly variable, even among patients that share the targeted mutation and tumor type. To move cancer into the era of personalized therapies, it becomes important to identify the alterations driving tumor progression in each tumor, determine the network that links these aberrations, and identify factors that predict sensitivity to targeted therapies. As projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) amass cancer cell genomes at a breathtaking pace, a staggering genetic complexity is revealed. To interpret cancer genomes, a key computational challenge is to separate the wheat from the chaff and define both what are the key alterations likely to be functionally driving cancer and then, after defining such genes, begin to identify mechanisms of action and therapeutic implications. Leveraging components from our published methods, CONEXIC (Akavia et.al Cell 2010) and LirNet (Lee et.al, PLOS Gen 2009), we will develop machine-learning algorithms that integrate cancer genomic data to do just that. We will apply the methods we develop to melanoma, glioblastoma, ovarian, breast and colon cancer and experimentally follow up on our computational findings, towards a better understanding of each of these deadly cancers. The approaches developed in this grant will accelerate discovery to rapidly extract the maximal value from modern genomic studies and help carry cancer genomics from the diagnostic to the therapeutic realm.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This work aims to develop methods that help dissect the genetic complexity of individual cancers. For each tumor we aim to identify which mutations arm a cell with the abilities to abnormally grow or evade drug treatment, providing a foundation of tools towards personalized cancer treatment.

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transcription factor p53 is a central tumor suppressor protein that controls DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. About half of human cancers have p53 mutations, and restoring p53 function in advanced tumors leads to tumor regression. Significantly, the large majority of these tumors produce full-length p53 proteins that have lost their tumor suppressor function due to single amino acid changes. Therefore, an attractive new approach to systemic cancer therapy is pharmacological reactivation of p53 cancer mutants. Reactivation of p53 cancer mutants is feasible because we and others have shown that introducing additional mutations (second-site suppressor mutations) can restore activity to the otherwise inactive p53 cancer mutants. In addition a few promising small molecule drug leads with unknown mechanisms of action have been reported to reactivate p53 cancer mutants. The challenge is to understand structural changes that lead to reactivation of p53 cancer mutants and to induce such changes through small molecules. This is a complex problem due to the diversity of clinically relevant single amino acid changes found in p53 cancer mutants.  We propose computational approaches based on machine learning that are supported by high-throughput biological strategies. We use novel saturation mutagenesis approaches to catalogue p53 rescue mutations for the 50 most relevant p53 mutants found in human cancer. The genetic data are used in an active learning scheme to train a computational classifier, that is based on modeled atom-level structural features, to predict which structural changes lead to reactivation of any given p53 cancer mutant. We further propose to apply this improved computational classifier to discover small molecules that induce similar structural changes and test these pre-selected compounds in a biological assay for p53 cancer mutant reactivation. Data obtained from these in vivo experiments will be used to further improve the computational predictions for small molecules.  In summary, we use genetic functional data to train a structure-based classifier to predict p53 activity based on an internal representation of modeled structural changes. The classifier will then be used to predict reactivation of p53 cancer mutants by small molecules with the aim to identify cancer drug leads. The proposed research has high impact on biomedical research and public health. About 250,000 US deaths yearly are due to tumors with full length but mutated and inactive p53. The long-term goal of this research, a drug that reactivates mutant p53, could prevent or delay these deaths.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the single most important protein to prevent cancer, and half of all human tumors produce a defective p53 protein. Pharmacological reactivation of the defective p53 proteins could potentially prevent or delay over 250,000 cancer deaths yearly in the US alone. This proposal uses genetic strategies and computational approaches to predict p53 reactivation by small molecules that can eventually develop into cancer drugs.

"Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wnt signaling is one of the most common pathways linked to carcinogenesis in the intestine. The transcription factors that mediate Wnt signals are members of the Lymphoid Enhancer Factor/T Cell Factor (LEF/TCF) family. This four-member family is complex in that there are full-length activating forms, truncated dominant negative forms, and alternatively spliced isoforms that modify Wnt target gene recognition. TCF-1 and TCF-4 are the two family members expressed in the epithelial crypt compartment of the intestine. Normally, TCF-1 is expressed as a dominant negative isoform and it counteracts the action of TCF-4 which is expressed as a Wnt-mediating, active isoform. This pattern changes in cancer because TCF-1 expression switches to a full-length, Wnt mediating form. We have discovered a second DNA binding domain in TCF-1 and TCF-4 isoforms called the C-clamp. We have shown that the C-clamp is important for regulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells. We have also identified Wnts that trigger TCF-1 export in colon cancer cells. Export of TCF-1 leaves the C-clamp form of TCF-4 in the nucleus to mediate aberrant Wnt signaling. Three aims are proposed for this project. First, the extracellular Wnts and intracellular components that direct TCF-1 nuclear export will be defined (Aim1). Second, the biological impact of export will be defined in colon cancer cells and colon cancer initiating 3D cultures (Aim2). Third, the DNA binding specificities and target gene selection of C-clamp forms of TCF-1 and TCF-4 will be defined through genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-Seq), high-throughput protein binding microarrays, and in vitro biochemical analysis (Aim3). The overall goal is to define the mechanisms behind changes in TCF expression in colon carcinogenesis, and to define how extracellular Wnts and DNA binding specificities of TCFs influence aberrant signaling in colon cancer cells with stabilized ?-catenin.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression. Wnt signaling is mediated by the TCF transcription factors and we have discovered their activities and expression to be different in colon cancer versus normal colon tissue. This project investigates basic mechanisms of TCF localization and gene targeting and asks how differences in these attributes contribute to the cancer cell phenotype.

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES Abstract We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions.

"Enhancing tumor vascular damage with gold nanoparticles aided radiation therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent developments in anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting therapies as well as hypofractionated radiotherapy have shown the great potential of tumor vasculature as a therapeutic target for cancer medicine. We have an original idea for using targeted gold nanoparticles as vascular disruptive agents (VDA) in conjunction with clinical megavoltage photon beams. Unlike competing proposals, we recognize that gold nanoparticles tend to accumulate in, and can even be targeted for, tumor blood vessels and that these structures may be more important for anti-cancer therapy than clonogenic cell death. Due to the short distance traveled by x-ray induced photoelectrons, the endothelial cells of the tumor will receive a sizable boost in dose, even for clinical megavoltage photon irradiation. We are proposing a therapy that would be highly compatible with current clinical practice and could offer a substantial clinical benefit. Upon the successful completion of the aims, we will have demonstrated the validity of two underlying premises: 1) gold nanoparticles can be effectively, and safely, targeted to the tumor endothelium, and 2) the incidence of endothelial cell apoptosis during radiotherapy will be highly correlated to the proximity and local concentrations of gold nanoparticles.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is the improvement of cancer therapy by employing gold nanoparticles, specifically targeted to tumor blood vessels, during radiation therapy. These nanoparticles will give off an extra radiation dose to their immediate surroundings during therapeutic irradiation. The ensuing collapse of the tumor vasculature could lead to large scale cancer cell death and potentially halt metastasis.              The goal of this project is the improvement of cancer therapy by employing gold nanoparticles, specifically targeted to tumor blood vessels, during radiation therapy.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,8134899,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2011,134067,0.034502290503628234
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.              n/a",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer program is focused on two skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and melanoma. The goals are to conduct epidemiologic and genetic studies on early onset basal cell carcinoma (Project 1), establish novel high-throughput prognostic and diagnostic tools for melanomas (Projects 2 and 4), and introduce novel targeted therapies to treat melanoma (Projects 2 and 3). The new approaches include genome-wide monitoring of melanoma tumor responses to epigenetic modifiers (Project 2); the use of high-density protein microarrays (ProtoArrays) to interrogate serological responses in sera from melanoma patients (Project 4); and novel epigenetic modifier and immune modulation therapy for melanoma (Projects 2 and 3, respectively). The SPORE includes Administration, Specimen Resource and Bioinformatics/Biostatistics Cores to support the studies of SPORE investigators. Developmental Research and Career Development Award Programs are proposed. The Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer will be an integral part of the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center (YCCC), Yale New Haven Hospital, and the Dermatology, Pathology and Epidemiology/Public Health Departments that collectively will provide the patient populations, specimens and other resources and support systems needed for the SPORE activities. There is a full commitment from the Dean of Yale School of Medicine and the Director of the YCCC/Chairman of Dermatology to support the SPORE with a plan for cost sharing. The major Translational Results expected are: a) Guidelines for preventive interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of early and total BCC that will diminish the management costs of the most common skin cancer; b) The introduction of new molecular tools for assessing responses to novel epigenetic modifiers; c) The introduction of new ways of assessing melanoma patients employing serological markers; d) The application of new approaches to personalize melanoma chemo- and immunotherapy; e) The establishment of a composite databases for skin cancers that includes specimens tracking, clinical information, high throughput proteomics and genomics. The database program will be compatible with caBIG and will be available on the web for the benefit of the wider community of investigators and clinicians; f) The creation of new translational bioinformatics tools (predictive statistics and artificial intelligence) required to analyze global and highly complex information derived from different sources and different platforms. n/a",Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer,8325739,P50CA121974,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Chairperson', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Cost Sharing', 'Databases', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Internet', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protein Microchips', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Skin Cancer', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Support System', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'chemotherapy', 'cost', 'density', 'early onset', 'genome-wide', 'immunoregulation', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'serological marker', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,P50,2011,500000,0.04571332349111897
"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transcription factor p53 is a central tumor suppressor protein that controls DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. About half of human cancers have p53 mutations, and restoring p53 function in advanced tumors leads to tumor regression. Significantly, the large majority of these tumors produce full-length p53 proteins that have lost their tumor suppressor function due to single amino acid changes. Therefore, an attractive new approach to systemic cancer therapy is pharmacological reactivation of p53 cancer mutants. Reactivation of p53 cancer mutants is feasible because we and others have shown that introducing additional mutations (second-site suppressor mutations) can restore activity to the otherwise inactive p53 cancer mutants. In addition a few promising small molecule drug leads with unknown mechanisms of action have been reported to reactivate p53 cancer mutants. The challenge is to understand structural changes that lead to reactivation of p53 cancer mutants and to induce such changes through small molecules. This is a complex problem due to the diversity of clinically relevant single amino acid changes found in p53 cancer mutants.  We propose computational approaches based on machine learning that are supported by high-throughput biological strategies. We use novel saturation mutagenesis approaches to catalogue p53 rescue mutations for the 50 most relevant p53 mutants found in human cancer. The genetic data are used in an active learning scheme to train a computational classifier, that is based on modeled atom-level structural features, to predict which structural changes lead to reactivation of any given p53 cancer mutant. We further propose to apply this improved computational classifier to discover small molecules that induce similar structural changes and test these pre-selected compounds in a biological assay for p53 cancer mutant reactivation. Data obtained from these in vivo experiments will be used to further improve the computational predictions for small molecules.  In summary, we use genetic functional data to train a structure-based classifier to predict p53 activity based on an internal representation of modeled structural changes. The classifier will then be used to predict reactivation of p53 cancer mutants by small molecules with the aim to identify cancer drug leads. The proposed research has high impact on biomedical research and public health. About 250,000 US deaths yearly are due to tumors with full length but mutated and inactive p53. The long-term goal of this research, a drug that reactivates mutant p53, could prevent or delay these deaths.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the single most important protein to prevent cancer, and half of all human tumors produce a defective p53 protein. Pharmacological reactivation of the defective p53 proteins could potentially prevent or delay over 250,000 cancer deaths yearly in the US alone. This proposal uses genetic strategies and computational approaches to predict p53 reactivation by small molecules that can eventually develop into cancer drugs.                        The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the single most important protein to prevent cancer, and half of all human tumors produce a defective p53 protein.

"Wnt Signaling in Colon Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Wnt signaling is one of the most common pathways linked to carcinogenesis in the intestine. The transcription factors that mediate Wnt signals are members of the Lymphoid Enhancer Factor/T Cell Factor (LEF/TCF) family. This four-member family is complex in that there are full-length activating forms, truncated dominant negative forms, and alternatively spliced isoforms that modify Wnt target gene recognition. TCF-1 and TCF-4 are the two family members expressed in the epithelial crypt compartment of the intestine. Normally, TCF-1 is expressed as a dominant negative isoform and it counteracts the action of TCF-4 which is expressed as a Wnt-mediating, active isoform. This pattern changes in cancer because TCF-1 expression switches to a full-length, Wnt mediating form. We have discovered a second DNA binding domain in TCF-1 and TCF-4 isoforms called the C-clamp. We have shown that the C-clamp is important for regulating cell proliferation of colon cancer cells. We have also identified Wnts that trigger TCF-1 export in colon cancer cells. Export of TCF-1 leaves the C-clamp form of TCF-4 in the nucleus to mediate aberrant Wnt signaling. Three aims are proposed for this project. First, the extracellular Wnts and intracellular components that direct TCF-1 nuclear export will be defined (Aim1). Second, the biological impact of export will be defined in colon cancer cells and colon cancer initiating 3D cultures (Aim2). Third, the DNA binding specificities and target gene selection of C-clamp forms of TCF-1 and TCF-4 will be defined through genome-wide binding assays (ChIP-Seq), high-throughput protein binding microarrays, and in vitro biochemical analysis (Aim3). The overall goal is to define the mechanisms behind changes in TCF expression in colon carcinogenesis, and to define how extracellular Wnts and DNA binding specificities of TCFs influence aberrant signaling in colon cancer cells with stabilized ?-catenin.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression. Wnt signaling is mediated by the TCF transcription factors and we have discovered their activities and expression to be different in colon cancer versus normal colon tissue. This project investigates basic mechanisms of TCF localization and gene targeting and asks how differences in these attributes contribute to the cancer cell phenotype.              In colon cancer, Wnt signaling is an overactive and strong signal for tumor initiation and progression.

"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges. Our ability to bring these opportunities to fruition depends on the development and application of sound and innovative statistical methods. Areas of particularly great need include methods for dealing with multiple hypothesis-testing problems (multiple comparison issues), and methods for combining data from multiple sources to achieve sharper inferences (data synthesis issues). The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer. The goals of this research are to develop such methods, and thereby to help generate new knowledge useful for cancer prevention and treatment.                                         n/a","""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""",8120480,R01CA094069,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Breast', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nucleotides', 'Odds Ratio', 'Output', 'Ovary', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prostate', 'Registries', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Study Section', 'Suggestion', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'breast cancer family registry', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'case control', 'computer program', 'conditioning', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,558584,-0.04409448385229715
"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will fund the further development and evaluation of a system that takes identified clinical documents and converts them into de-identified, concept-coded, structured data. The system enables researchers to access remainder tissues and clinical report data for research purposes within and across institution. This project is important because it will greatly increase the access of researchers to important data and materials while maintaining patient privacy.          n/a",Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES,7999244,R01CA132672,"['Access to Information', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Center', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Ductal', 'Electronic Mail', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Information Retrieval', 'Institution', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operating System', 'Pathology Report', 'Performance', 'Private Hospitals', 'Process', 'Report (document)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Specimen', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'University Hospitals', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'clinical phenotype', 'computer human interaction', 'ductal breast carcinoma', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'metathesaurus', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'portability', 'repository', 'software development', 'software systems', 'systems research', 'tool', 'usability']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2011,304932,-0.00404466248272236
"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,7907646,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2010,131421,0.034502290503628234
"Combinatorial Genomics in Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted therapy of cancer requires a clear understanding of the genetic alterations that drive malignant cell growth. Identification of causal genetic alterations is complicated by three characteristics of cancer etiology: 1.) multiple interacting alterations are often required to cause cancer, 2.) several distinct alterations may be sufficient to generate a single cancer phenotype, and 3.) oncogenic alterations appear in a dense background of normal genetic activity and spurious consequences of malignant cell growth. We propose to apply a variant of the machine learning algorithm PRIM to the task of identifying disjunctive sets of conjunctive genetic alterations that cause specific cancers or provide prognostic information about clinical course and treatment efficacy. These analyses synthesize information from low-level bioinformatics resources we have already developed to map chromosomal alterations and monitor global patterns of transcription factor activity. Based on those foundations, the present studies develop high-level analytic tools to map combinatorial interactions among low-level genomic events. Specifically, these studies seek to: Aim 1: Develop graphical user interface (GUI) software to support combinatorial genomic analyses by biologists with limited computational background. Aim 2: Optimize combinatorial prediction of disease progression and treatment response. Aim 3: Develop PRIM-based statistical models to identify functional complementation groups of genetic alterations and transcriptional control signals. The bioinformatic tools produced in these studies will create a generalized analytic infrastructure for mapping complex etiologies in cancer and deploying patient-specific targeted therapies.          n/a",Combinatorial Genomics in Cancer,7882364,R01CA116778,"['Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'combinatorial', 'graphical user interface', 'prognostic', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2010,199526,0.05018267403104964
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite.

Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics.

"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care. What makes this project a ""grand opportunity"" is the pursuit of rapid progress through a highly multidisciplinary team that will draw on new advances in the areas of cell lineage behaviors, cancer stem cells, three-dimensional mathematical and computational modeling, and machine-learning.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down. We hypothesize that, within the details of how a tumor grows lie important clues about the nature of feedback processes-including those that still remain or may be re-activated. By describing how such clues can be found, we will be defining a new approach for predicting how individual tumors behave in cancer patients, and how they respond to different kinds of therapy.              Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down.

"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths.

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The transcription factor p53 is a central tumor suppressor protein that controls DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. About half of human cancers have p53 mutations, and restoring p53 function in advanced tumors leads to tumor regression. Significantly, the large majority of these tumors produce full-length p53 proteins that have lost their tumor suppressor function due to single amino acid changes. Therefore, an attractive new approach to systemic cancer therapy is pharmacological reactivation of p53 cancer mutants. Reactivation of p53 cancer mutants is feasible because we and others have shown that introducing additional mutations (second-site suppressor mutations) can restore activity to the otherwise inactive p53 cancer mutants. In addition a few promising small molecule drug leads with unknown mechanisms of action have been reported to reactivate p53 cancer mutants. The challenge is to understand structural changes that lead to reactivation of p53 cancer mutants and to induce such changes through small molecules. This is a complex problem due to the diversity of clinically relevant single amino acid changes found in p53 cancer mutants.  We propose computational approaches based on machine learning that are supported by high-throughput biological strategies. We use novel saturation mutagenesis approaches to catalogue p53 rescue mutations for the 50 most relevant p53 mutants found in human cancer. The genetic data are used in an active learning scheme to train a computational classifier, that is based on modeled atom-level structural features, to predict which structural changes lead to reactivation of any given p53 cancer mutant. We further propose to apply this improved computational classifier to discover small molecules that induce similar structural changes and test these pre-selected compounds in a biological assay for p53 cancer mutant reactivation. Data obtained from these in vivo experiments will be used to further improve the computational predictions for small molecules.  In summary, we use genetic functional data to train a structure-based classifier to predict p53 activity based on an internal representation of modeled structural changes. The classifier will then be used to predict reactivation of p53 cancer mutants by small molecules with the aim to identify cancer drug leads. The proposed research has high impact on biomedical research and public health. About 250,000 US deaths yearly are due to tumors with full length but mutated and inactive p53. The long-term goal of this research, a drug that reactivates mutant p53, could prevent or delay these deaths.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The tumor suppressor protein p53 is the single most important protein to prevent cancer, and half of all human tumors produce a defective p53 protein.

"Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, cancer survival rates dramatically increase and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect early stage cancer are crucial. The overall goal of our research is to develop such an early detection screening test. We intend to prospectively accrue a large well-defined independent cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases where we collect extensive data on this cohort at the time of diagnosis. We will generate a comprehensive database that includes data on demographics, personal and family history, tumor characteristics, and comorbidities. Our preliminary research efforts have been to develop a detection assay utilizing the sera of our discovery cohort of CRC patients and healthy controls. We have developed a high throughput method to isolated cDNA clones of antigens which can be used to identify cancer cases by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject. Our first aim is to identify the minimal number of antigen clones that are critical in distinguishing sera from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls utilizing our initial discovery cohort. We will eliminate antigen clones from our discovery set of 3800 clones that react with sera from patients with other cancers, benign gastrointestinal conditions, duplicates or do not react with any CRC sera. Our second aim is to determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) on these newly selected antigen markers for distinguishing colorectal cancer cases using newly acquired sera samples not previously used in the development of the marker set. Lastly, we intend to determine the test characteristics of these antigen markers on a large independent well-defined cohort of colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls. In addition, due to the size, racial/ethnic makeup of the study population, and captured patient data, we will be able to evaluate the expression of these markers in relationship to important subgroups.              Project Narrative The significance of this work is to develop an assay that can identify cancerous and pre-cancerous conditions in patients before the onset of clinical symptoms. Current technologies have been disappointing and have not resulted in diagnostic tests sufficiently reliable to apply to clinical practice in the detection of colon cancer. The focus of this work is to utilized new technology develop in our laboratory to define a non-invasive blood test applicable to early detection, diagnosis and/or screening of patients and permit preventive strategies, differential treatment and/or therapeutic targeting.",Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection,7826919,R21CA132723,"['Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Comorbidity', 'Complementary DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family history of', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Non-Malignant', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Printing', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'new technology', 'racial and ethnic', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2010,165419,0.04196349008843393
"ROC Based Methods or Risk Factor Prediction and Evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cancer screening with early detection and intervention is a key factor for successful treatment and has shown potential to improve survival and reduce mortality of the cancer patients. ROC based methods have been extensively utilized to evaluate the performance of early detection. However, for evaluating early detection tests of cancer, ROC curves have been either underused or not always used in the best manner. Cancer researchers also need efficient methods to identify risk factors (biomarkers) that could improve the performance of early detection. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new methods for identifying and evaluating the prognostic and diagnostic risk factors (biomarkers) for earlier cancer detection and risk assessment. This pilot project focuses on developing novel ROC based computational models for risk factor identification, biomarker evaluation, and cancer prediction in cancer screening. Both linear and nonlinear models will be developed. It will provide efficient computational tools for earlier cancer detection, prevention, and risk assessment.           Public Health Relevant Statement This research will provide computational tools and software for early cancer detection and intervention.

"microRNA signatures of tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This proposal aims to identify unique microRNA signatures that associated with the oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) initiation and progression. The attaining of these molecular signatures will lead to a set of novel biomarkers for the early detection of oral SCC. In addition, the microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will be explored. The strategic integration of our observations at microRNA and mRNA levels will advance the overall understanding of this disease process at system biology level. An additional goal of this proposal is to establish an animal model that permits high throughput genomic analysis of the oral SCC disease process. Most of the early studies utilized a hamster model to study oral cancer. Due to the lack of in-depth knowledge on hamster genome, only limited genomic analyses can be performed on this model. In this study, we will establish a tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer model in mice. Our preliminary results demonstrated the feasibility of this mouse model. This will enable us to perform genome-wide genomic analysis and lead to better understanding of the initiation and progression of this disease, as well as the identification of biomarkers for the early detection of oral cancer. Two specific aims were proposed to accomplish these objectives: The Specific Aim 1 is to establish a mouse oral cancer model induced with physiological tobacco carcinogen. This mouse model will provide us with unique opportunity to study alteration in microRNA (as well as other genome-wide studies) during the course of oral carcinogenesis. The Specific Aim 2 is to identify microRNA signatures and their correlation with mRNA expression patterns for oral cancer initiation and progression. Statistical and bioinformatic approaches will be used to identify potential markers and their classification power will be evaluated. The microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will also be identified and evaluated.            Reference to Public Health (Project Narrative): Oral cancer is one of the most devastating cancers. This study utilizes innovative approaches to identify biomarkers for early diagnosis of oral cancer and potential therapeutic targets for cancer prevention from a pool of novel nucleic acid molecules (microRNA).",microRNA signatures of tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer,7817181,R03CA135992,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Model', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hamsters', 'Human Genetics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Mouth Diseases', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Pyrenes', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Science', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Staging', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco-Associated Carcinogen', 'Universities', 'anticancer research', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer prevention', 'carcinogenesis', 'cellular pathology', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'mRNA Expression', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'maxillofacial', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'novel', 'oral carcinogenesis', 'programs', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenic']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R03,2010,78500,0.0536571022319498
"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges. Our ability to bring these opportunities to fruition depends on the development and application of sound and innovative statistical methods. Areas of particularly great need include methods for dealing with multiple hypothesis-testing problems (multiple comparison issues), and methods for combining data from multiple sources to achieve sharper inferences (data synthesis issues). The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer. The goals of this research are to develop such methods, and thereby to help generate new knowledge useful for cancer prevention and treatment.                                         n/a","""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""",7936896,R01CA094069,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Breast', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nucleotides', 'Odds Ratio', 'Output', 'Ovary', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prostate', 'Registries', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Study Section', 'Suggestion', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'breast cancer family registry', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'case control', 'computer program', 'conditioning', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,580133,-0.04409448385229715
"Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer program is focused on two skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and melanoma. The goals are to conduct epidemiologic and genetic studies on early onset basal cell carcinoma (Project 1), establish novel high-throughput prognostic and diagnostic tools for melanomas (Projects 2 and 4), and introduce novel targeted therapies to treat melanoma (Projects 2 and 3). The new approaches include genome-wide monitoring of melanoma tumor responses to epigenetic modifiers (Project 2); the use of high-density protein microarrays (ProtoArrays) to interrogate serological responses in sera from melanoma patients (Project 4); and novel epigenetic modifier and immune modulation therapy for melanoma (Projects 2 and 3, respectively). The SPORE includes Administration, Specimen Resource and Bioinformatics/Biostatistics Cores to support the studies of SPORE investigators. Developmental Research and Career Development Award Programs are proposed. The Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer will be an integral part of the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center (YCCC), Yale New Haven Hospital, and the Dermatology, Pathology and Epidemiology/Public Health Departments that collectively will provide the patient populations, specimens and other resources and support systems needed for the SPORE activities. There is a full commitment from the Dean of Yale School of Medicine and the Director of the YCCC/Chairman of Dermatology to support the SPORE with a plan for cost sharing. The major Translational Results expected are: a) Guidelines for preventive interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of early and total BCC that will diminish the management costs of the most common skin cancer; b) The introduction of new molecular tools for assessing responses to novel epigenetic modifiers; c) The introduction of new ways of assessing melanoma patients employing serological markers; d) The application of new approaches to personalize melanoma chemo- and immunotherapy; e) The establishment of a composite databases for skin cancers that includes specimens tracking, clinical information, high throughput proteomics and genomics. The database program will be compatible with caBIG and will be available on the web for the benefit of the wider community of investigators and clinicians; f) The creation of new translational bioinformatics tools (predictive statistics and artificial intelligence) required to analyze global and highly complex information derived from different sources and different platforms. n/a",Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer,7901171,P50CA121974,[' '],NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,P50,2010,2233298,0.04571332349111897
"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will fund the further development and evaluation of a system that takes identified clinical documents and converts them into de-identified, concept-coded, structured data. The system enables researchers to access remainder tissues and clinical report data for research purposes within and across institution.

"Automatic Detection of Critical Dermoscopy Features for Basal Cell Carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SkinScan digital dermoscopy skin cancer detection software, developed by Missouri's S&A, can now detect critical features of early melanoma. However, there is also a need for diagnostic help for the other 90+% of skin cancers. The need for diagnostic improvement in screening for skin cancers may be greatest in those nurse practitioners who now see the majority of elderly patients in some underserved areas. Underserved clinical arenas with a greater than average incidence of skin cancer and significant numbers of nurse practitioners include both civilian and military clinics in the rural Midwest, where S&A is located. This innovative software is a timely development designed to solve problems every healthcare consumer has encountered- too long a wait to get specialty care, uncertainty about the diagnosis when one does get the care, and too much overall expenditure in providing the care. The proposed Phase I research addresses the steps needed to develop the SkinScan automatic detection modules for basal cell carcinoma. The BASAL features, first described by Stoecker and Stolz, will be programmed during Phase I and incorporated in our early detection system. Additional work during Phase I will allow acquisition of more clinical and dermoscopy images, will allow training of the first nurse practitioner, and will allow development of a hierarchical neural network for diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. With over a decade of development using thousands of images from dermatology practices in the United States and Europe, SkinScan at the end of the Phase II research period will have demonstrated effectiveness in an early cancer detection clinical trial. This trial provides a bridge to market for a product that will result in increased access to high quality care by providing automated diagnostic assistance for the most deadly skin cancer, melanoma, and the most common skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, by detecting key early features of these skin cancers. The software is designed to guide the non-specialist nurse practitioner or physician assistant, helping to make the biopsy/no biopsy decision, the most critical decision in early detection of skin cancer.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: S&A proposes the SkinScan Training System for Skin Cancer Screening, to meet the needs of nurse practitioners in finding skin cancers. S&A offers practitioners an integrated database system that allows even those without specialized dermatology training to identify skin cancers at a very early stage, before they become deadly. The S&A SkinScan Training System is comprised of 3 parts: Dermoscopy cancer detection software with searchable atlas, DermLite D3 cross-polarized light dermoscope, and Melanoma and Mimics Clinical Tutorial. Phase I of this research proposal contains key milestones in development of the most advanced software dedicated to identifying signs on dermoscopy images of the most common skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma. SkinScan is in an excellent position to compete in the marketplace. Key personnel at S&A bring decades of experience in software development and a record of introducing innovative software to the dermatology market. The SkinScan system is the first such product to be marketed to nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and family practitioners. This proposal concentrates on nurse practitioners, the largest single group of non-physician practitioners seeing primarily adults in a general practice setting. Phase I and Phase II of this proposal should allow us to reach the software sale stage.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,7675425,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2009,128852,0.034502290503628234

"Combinatorial Genomics in Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted therapy of cancer requires a clear understanding of the genetic alterations that drive malignant cell growth. Identification of causal genetic alterations is complicated by three characteristics of cancer etiology: 1.) multiple interacting alterations are often required to cause cancer, 2.) several distinct alterations may be sufficient to generate a single cancer phenotype, and 3.) oncogenic alterations appear in a dense background of normal genetic activity and spurious consequences of malignant cell growth. We propose to apply a variant of the machine learning algorithm PRIM to the task of identifying disjunctive sets of conjunctive genetic alterations that cause specific cancers or provide prognostic information about clinical course and treatment efficacy. These analyses synthesize information from low-level bioinformatics resources we have already developed to map chromosomal alterations and monitor global patterns of transcription factor activity. Based on those foundations, the present studies develop high-level analytic tools to map combinatorial interactions among low-level genomic events. Specifically, these studies seek to: Aim 1: Develop graphical user interface (GUI) software to support combinatorial genomic analyses by biologists with limited computational background. Aim 2: Optimize combinatorial prediction of disease progression and treatment response. Aim 3: Develop PRIM-based statistical models to identify functional complementation groups of genetic alterations and transcriptional control signals. The bioinformatic tools produced in these studies will create a generalized analytic infrastructure for mapping complex etiologies in cancer and deploying patient-specific targeted therapies.          n/a",Combinatorial Genomics in Cancer,7661365,R01CA116778,"['Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'combinatorial', 'graphical user interface', 'prognostic', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2009,199526,0.05018267403104964
"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             n/a",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7910931,U24CA126561,"['Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feeds', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Molecular Target', 'Public Health', 'Random Allocation', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Silver', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'cancer genome', 'cost', 'data portal', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput technology', 'interest', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2009,523967,0.07553128919744838
"Visualization and Analysis of the TCGA Data Using the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project aims to determine the feasibility of identifying and cataloging the genomic-level alterations associated with human cancers, including alterations in DNA copy number and transcript levels, epigenetic modifications, cancer somatic mutations, and inherited genetic variance that contribute to cancer susceptibility. As experimental techniques for a comprehensive survey of the cancer landscape mature, there is a great demand in the cancer research field to develop advanced analysis and visualization tools for the characterization and integrative analysis of the large, complex genomic datasets arising from different technology platforms.    The proposed UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser is a suite of web-based tools designed to integrate, visualize and analyze genomic and clinical data generated by the TCGA project. The browser, which will be available at https://cancer.cse.ucsc.edu/, currently consists of three major components: hgHeatmap, hgFeatureSorter and hgPathSorter. The main panel, hgHeatmap, displays a whole-genome-oriented view of genome-wide experimental measurements for individual and sets of samples/patients along with their clinical information. hgFeatureSorter and hgPathSorter together enable investigators to order, filter, aggregate and display data interactively based on any given feature set ranging from clinical features to annotated biological pathways to user-edited collections of genes. Standard and advanced statistical tools will be installed on the server's side through a caBIG-compatible mechanism to provide quantitative analysis of the whole genomic data or any of its subsets. The UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser is an extension of the UCSC Genome Browser; thus it inherits and integrates the Genome Browser's existing rich set of human biology and genetics data to enhance the interpretability of the cancer genomic data. A pathway- centric, multi-layer machine learning algorithm, BioIntegrator, will be built on top of the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for the integration of cancer genomics and clinical data to assess the levels of perturbation of biological pathways in cancers and during the course of therapy, and to predict clinical outcomes.    Collectively, these proposed tools will facilitate a synergistic interaction among clinicians, experimental biologists and bioinformaticians. They will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA cancer genomics data resources, and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools may advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, as well as the development of therapeutic and prevention strategies.           n/a",Visualization and Analysis of the TCGA Data Using the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browse,7692314,R21CA135937,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Plug-in', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'prognostic', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2009,180460,0.10339790762085552
"UCSC-Buck Inst. Genome Data Analysis Center for TCGA Research Network (GDAC)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project holds promise for a comprehensive understanding of human cancer through the application of genomic technologies. However, current cancer genomic analytical and visualization technologies still have many limitations that will likely prevent investigators from taking full advantage of this resource. The proposed UCSC-Buck Institute Genome Data Analysis Center will support an integrative analysis of TCGA data for all surveyed cancer types throughout the project. The major components of the pipeline are a pathway-centric multi-layer machine learning tool called Biolntegrator, a genome rearrangement detector for next-gen sequencing data, and the tightly coupled UCSC browser tool suite. We aim to detect cancer-associated molecular alterations and the biological pathways that are perturbed by them in tumor samples. Samples will then be classified into clinically relevant categories based on pathway perturbations rather than perturbations of individual genes, which we believe will be more robust, biologically meaningful and clinically accurate. Using Biolntegrator and the associated tools, we will further integrate TCGA data with datasets from external studies, including cell line studies, animal studies and clinical trials, to identify (1) cancer-associated molecular alterations; (2) dysregulated pathways and signatures useful in clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and drug response prediction; and (3) gene targets for the development of novel therapeutics. These results will provide the basis for a refined patient stratification in therapy and will generate new hypotheses for translational research. The tightly coupled UCSC browser suite, which will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of the TCGA project, includes the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for visualizing TCGA cancer genomics, clinical data, and analysis results; the UCSC Tumor Browser for displaying tumor genome rearrangements and other tumor mutations; and the UCSC Human Genome Browser for integrating the data with human genome annotations and information gleaned from other projects such as ENCODE and the NIH Epigenomics Roadmap Initiative. The browser resource, hosting this rapidly growing body of cancer genomics data, will enable investigators to perform interactive in-silico experiments to test new hypotheses derived from the TCGA data. Collectively, these proposed tools will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA resources and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools will advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, leading to new therapeutic and preventative strategies.              n/a",UCSC-Buck Inst.

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objectives are (1) demonstrate computational and experimental methods cooperating to achieve a functional census of a large mutation sequence space of great medical importance; (2) contribute to our knowledge of p53 functional rescue mechanisms, and so facilitate the search for a small molecule cancer drug that effects an analogous functional rescue of p53; and (3) elucidate part of the systems biology of cancer by characterizing the spectrum of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants across known downstream p53 DNA binding sites. Mutations to the tumor suppressor protein p53 occur in approximately half of all human cancers, and restoring function to a mutationally defective p53 protein is a long-held medical goal. Biological precedence for rescuing p53 cancer mutations is found in second-site p53 cancer suppressor mutations. The analogous p53 pharmacological rescue would save hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Understanding and predicting p53 rescue is an important step toward that goal.      The specific aims are (1) computationally predict all single suppressor mutations for p53 cancer mutants and validate the results experimentally, (2) optimize the rescue effects of known and putative p53 suppressor regions through two or more coordinated mutation changes, and (3) predict and experimentally validate the DNA binding specificity of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants for known p53 DNA binding sites. Our broad strategy is a coordinated computational and experimental attack. We already have experimental p53 functional assays and computational predictors of p53 activity, developed as part of our Preliminary Studies. Computational predictors will be used to focus experimental work into the highest priority areas. Experimental validation of the predictions will lead to a larger training set for machine learning techniques. The larger training set will lead to even more accurate predictions, thus even more focused experimentation. Thus, the interplay between computation and experiment will become ever more efficient as the project progresses. Variations of this basic strategy apply to each of our Specific Aims, which all rely on closely coordinated experiment and computation. n/a",A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants,7613343,R01CA112560,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancerous', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Consensus', 'DNA Binding', 'Data Sources', 'Engineering', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proliferating', 'Protein p53', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Suppressor Mutations', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'functional restoration', 'interest', 'killings', 'mutant', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'web site']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2009,342292,0.04925417657559257
"Feedback, lineages and cancer: A multidisciplinary approach.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is a disorder of unrestrained cell proliferation, but increasingly it seems that not all proliferating cells in a tumor matter equally. As with cells in normal tissues, tumor cells appear to progress through lineage stages, in which the capacity for unlimited self-renewal is, at some point, lost. The cancer stem cell hypothesis states that cancer diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic efforts need to be focused on that population of cells-often a small minority-that undergoes long-term self-renewal. While this hypothesis acknowledges the existence of lineage progression in cancers, it is silent on the function that lineages normally serve. We recently found, through experimental and theoretical work, that a likely raison-d'etre for lineages is to provide a framework for powerful feedback control of growth and regeneration, through mechanisms that target the differentiation decisions of individual cells. For cancer to develop, such feedback control must be disrupted, and the natural history of most tumors suggests that it becomes disrupted progressively over time. Our studies indicate that what happens in a tissue when feedback is compromised can be very complex, yet still understandable and predictable. We argue, therefore, that from the details of how a tumor develops over time-size, shape, growth rate, stem cell fraction, etc.-one ought to be able to infer specific information about the kinds of control processes that operate (or recently operated) within the tumor and its surrounding environment. Such information can both provide insight into how different types of tumors develop, as well as patient-specific information about prognosis and the effects of therapy. The proposed project focuses on learning how to obtain such information from the observable properties of tumors. Three-dimensional mathematical models that incorporate various types of lineage progression, feedback, evolutionary processes, and therapeutic interventions will first be created, analyzed, and used to generate large numbers of simulations of solid tumor growth and progression. From these results, mappings from tumor properties to feedback and lineage architectures will be found through state-of-the art machine-learning algorithms. The ability of these mappings to reproduce and predict the behaviors of real tumors will be assessed using established animal models of breast cancer, in which luminescent and fluorescent imaging techniques are used to follow tumors, and their stem cells, over time. This will enable the validation of particular model architectures, or suggest methods for their refinement, and allow the determination of control strategies at work in tumors that can be exploited to provide a leap forward in both personalized medicine and cancer care. What makes this project a ""grand opportunity"" is the pursuit of rapid progress through a highly multidisciplinary team that will draw on new advances in the areas of cell lineage behaviors, cancer stem cells, three-dimensional mathematical and computational modeling, and machine-learning.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down. We hypothesize that, within the details of how a tumor grows lie important clues about the nature of feedback processes-including those that still remain or may be re-activated. By describing how such clues can be found, we will be defining a new approach for predicting how individual tumors behave in cancer patients, and how they respond to different kinds of therapy.              Tumors arise when the feedback control of cell growth breaks down.

"An in-silico method for epidemiological studies using Electronic Medical Records    DESCRIPTION: Observational epidemiological studies are effective methods for identifying factors affecting the health and illness of populations, as well as for determining optimal treatments for diseases, such as cancers. However, conventional epidemiological research usually involves personnel-intensive effort (such as manual chart and public records review) and can be very time consuming before conclusive results are obtained. Recently, a large amount of detailed longitudinal clinical data has been accumulated at hospitals' Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and it has become a valuable data source for epidemiological studies. However, there are two obstacles that prevent the wide usage of EMR data in epidemiological studies. First, most of the detailed clinical information in EMRs is embedded in narrative text and it is very costly to extract that information manually. Second, EMRs usually have data quality problems such as selection bias and missing data, which require adaptation of conventional statistical methods developed for randomized controlled trials.   In this study, we propose an in silico informatics-based approach for observational epidemiological studies using EMR data. We hypothesize that existing EMR data can be used for certain types of epidemiological studies in a very efficient manner with the help of informatics methods. The informatics-based approach will contain two major components. One is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) based information extraction system that can automatically extract detailed clinical information from EMR and another is a set of statistical and informatics methods that can be used to analyze EMR-derived data. If the feasibility of this approach is proven, it will change the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research, because it has the capability to answer an epidemiological question in a very short time at a very low cost. The specific aim of this study is to develop an automated informatics approach to extract both fine-grained cancer findings and general clinical information from EMRs and use them to conduct cancer related epidemiological studies. We will perform both casecontrol and cohort studies related to prevention and treatment of breast and colon cancers using EMR data. The informatics approach will be validated on EMRs from two major hospitals to demonstrate its generalizability. Epidemiological findings from our study will be compared to reported findings for validation.      Narrative: According to the American Cancer Society, about 7.6 million people died from various types of cancer in the world during 2007.

"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths. This research will develop an innovative computational system with implications for early detection of cancer as well as potential recurrence and metastasis, leading to increased survival rates.

"Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  When cancer is identified at the earliest stages, cancer survival rates dramatically increase and therefore diagnostic screening tests that can detect early stage cancer are crucial. The overall goal of our research is to develop such an early detection screening test. We intend to prospectively accrue a large well-defined independent cohort of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases where we collect extensive data on this cohort at the time of diagnosis. We will generate a comprehensive database that includes data on demographics, personal and family history, tumor characteristics, and comorbidities. Our preliminary research efforts have been to develop a detection assay utilizing the sera of our discovery cohort of CRC patients and healthy controls. We have developed a high throughput method to isolated cDNA clones of antigens which can be used to identify cancer cases by detecting the presence of auto-antibodies to tumor proteins in the serum of the test subject. Our first aim is to identify the minimal number of antigen clones that are critical in distinguishing sera from patients with colorectal cancer from healthy controls utilizing our initial discovery cohort. We will eliminate antigen clones from our discovery set of 3800 clones that react with sera from patients with other cancers, benign gastrointestinal conditions, duplicates or do not react with any CRC sera. Our second aim is to determine the test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy) on these newly selected antigen markers for distinguishing colorectal cancer cases using newly acquired sera samples not previously used in the development of the marker set. Lastly, we intend to determine the test characteristics of these antigen markers on a large independent well-defined cohort of colorectal cancer patients and healthy controls. In addition, due to the size, racial/ethnic makeup of the study population, and captured patient data, we will be able to evaluate the expression of these markers in relationship to important subgroups.              Project Narrative The significance of this work is to develop an assay that can identify cancerous and pre-cancerous conditions in patients before the onset of clinical symptoms. Current technologies have been disappointing and have not resulted in diagnostic tests sufficiently reliable to apply to clinical practice in the detection of colon cancer. The focus of this work is to utilized new technology develop in our laboratory to define a non-invasive blood test applicable to early detection, diagnosis and/or screening of patients and permit preventive strategies, differential treatment and/or therapeutic targeting.",Serum Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer Detection,7586435,R21CA132723,"['Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Comorbidity', 'Complementary DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family history of', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Non-Malignant', 'Patients', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Printing', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'gastrointestinal', 'improved', 'new technology', 'racial and ethnic', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor']",NCI,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,211859,0.04196349008843393
"ROC Based Methods or Risk Factor Prediction and Evaluation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Cancer screening with early detection and intervention is a key factor for successful treatment and has shown potential to improve survival and reduce mortality of the cancer patients. ROC based methods have been extensively utilized to evaluate the performance of early detection. However, for evaluating early detection tests of cancer, ROC curves have been either underused or not always used in the best manner. Cancer researchers also need efficient methods to identify risk factors (biomarkers) that could improve the performance of early detection. Therefore, it is crucial to develop new methods for identifying and evaluating the prognostic and diagnostic risk factors (biomarkers) for earlier cancer detection and risk assessment. This pilot project focuses on developing novel ROC based computational models for risk factor identification, biomarker evaluation, and cancer prediction in cancer screening. Both linear and nonlinear models will be developed. It will provide efficient computational tools for earlier cancer detection, prevention, and risk assessment.           Public Health Relevant Statement This research will provide computational tools and software for early cancer detection and intervention.

"microRNA signatures of tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      This proposal aims to identify unique microRNA signatures that associated with the oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) initiation and progression. The attaining of these molecular signatures will lead to a set of novel biomarkers for the early detection of oral SCC. In addition, the microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will be explored. The strategic integration of our observations at microRNA and mRNA levels will advance the overall understanding of this disease process at system biology level. An additional goal of this proposal is to establish an animal model that permits high throughput genomic analysis of the oral SCC disease process. Most of the early studies utilized a hamster model to study oral cancer. Due to the lack of in-depth knowledge on hamster genome, only limited genomic analyses can be performed on this model. In this study, we will establish a tobacco carcinogen induced oral cancer model in mice. Our preliminary results demonstrated the feasibility of this mouse model. This will enable us to perform genome-wide genomic analysis and lead to better understanding of the initiation and progression of this disease, as well as the identification of biomarkers for the early detection of oral cancer. Two specific aims were proposed to accomplish these objectives: The Specific Aim 1 is to establish a mouse oral cancer model induced with physiological tobacco carcinogen. This mouse model will provide us with unique opportunity to study alteration in microRNA (as well as other genome-wide studies) during the course of oral carcinogenesis. The Specific Aim 2 is to identify microRNA signatures and their correlation with mRNA expression patterns for oral cancer initiation and progression. Statistical and bioinformatic approaches will be used to identify potential markers and their classification power will be evaluated. The microRNA-mRNA regulatory modules will also be identified and evaluated.            Reference to Public Health (Project Narrative): Oral cancer is one of the most devastating cancers.

"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges. Our ability to bring these opportunities to fruition depends on the development and application of sound and innovative statistical methods. Areas of particularly great need include methods for dealing with multiple hypothesis-testing problems (multiple comparison issues), and methods for combining data from multiple sources to achieve sharper inferences (data synthesis issues). The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer. The goals of this research are to develop such methods, and thereby to help generate new knowledge useful for cancer prevention and treatment.                                         n/a","""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""",7670458,R01CA094069,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Breast', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nucleotides', 'Odds Ratio', 'Output', 'Ovary', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prostate', 'Registries', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Study Section', 'Suggestion', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'breast cancer family registry', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'case control', 'computer program', 'conditioning', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,573074,-0.04409448385229715
"Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer program is focused on two skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and melanoma.

"Genotype and phenotype predictors in therapy response in renal cell carcinoma     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapy of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been transformed in recent years by the efficacy of targeted agents that inhibit kinases involved in critical cellular signaling pathways and VEGF, a primary driver of tumor angiogenesis. However, patient response to these therapeutics is highly variable and currently cannot be predicted based on clinical or pathological data or available laboratory/genetic testing. The goal of this proposal is to develop predictors of therapeutic response for patients with the most common subtype of RCC, clear cell (ccRCC), based on novel tests. Our approach is based primarily on the hypothesis that the targeted agents used in ccRCC therapy - bevacizumab, sunitinib and sorafenib - inhibit tumor vessel activation and that the activation status and stability of tumor vessels are major determinants of response. We also hypothesize that the phenotype of ccRCC tumor vessels is linked to the molecular pathobiology of the tumor cells. In particular, as these drugs also can inhibit tumor cell signaling and modulate their behavior, ccRCC tumor cell signaling, HIF-1/HIF-2 (hypoxia-inducible factor) expression and VHL function are potential determinants of response. To examine parameters of vascular phenotype, tumor cell phenotype and VHL genotype as predictors of response to therapy, ccRCC specimens will undergo multiplex immunostaining for the appropriate biomarker antigens and be analyzed by a novel computer-assisted image analysis system that objectively quantifies analyte staining on a cellular (cytometric) basis as well as by traditional pixel-based analysis. These studies will be performed on tumors of ccRCC patients treated with single-agent bevacizumab, sunitinib or sorafenib in ongoing multi-institutional phase II (ECOG2804) and phase III (ECOG2805) clinical trials, using tumor blocks from a subset of 90, 170 and 170 appropriate ccRCC patients for therapy with the respective drugs. The specific aims of this proposal are (Aim 1) to analyze the vascular and endothelial cell activation phenotype and vessel pericyte coverage in ccRCC tumors; (Aim 2) to analyze tumor cell signaling, HIF phenotype and VHL genotype in ccRCC tumors; and (Aim 3) to correlate parameters quantified in the prior aims for relationships to each other, to therapeutic outcome and to develop parsimonious predictive models of therapeutic response using biostatistical and bioinformatics approaches. The results of these studies should allow identification of the most appropriate drugs for treating individual patients with ccRCC and assist in the rational development of second-line and combination drug therapies. Beyond ccRCC, the targeted agents under study are used in the therapy of an ever expanding number of cancers, and the response predictors developed for ccRCC, where these agents are best studied because they are used as single-agents, may be useful for predicting response of these other cancers to combination therapy incorporating the targeted agents. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year. Studies in this project will characterize the tumor blood vessel characteristics and genetic defect of renal cell carcinomas and correlate them with therapeutic response to identify factors that can predict whether they will respond to treatment. Discovering features of kidney cancer that predict therapeutic response can then be used to stratify patients to different therapies in the future   and will provide lessons that are likely to be applicable to many other cancers being treated with the same novel drugs.           Novel targeted cancer therapy agents have shown success in the treatment of kidney cancer (renal cell carcinoma), a cancer that is increasing in incidence and newly diagnosed in over 50,000 Americans a year.

"Continued Development and Evaluation of caTIES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to further develop, test, evaluate and support caTIES - an existing software system for developing networked repositories of sharable de-identified surgical pathology reports. The caTIES system creates a repository of de-identified, structured, and concept-coded clinical reports derived from large corpora of clinical free-text. Documents are automatically coded against a controlled terminology such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), SNOMED-CT, or NCI Metathesaurus. Users construct queries to identify specific kinds of documents and tissue specimens based on the associated clinical report. For example, a researcher studying genetic variation in metastatic breast cancers can identify cases of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, followed by metastatic ductal cancer in bone at an interval of three years or greater from the original diagnosis. The caTIES system also supports acquisition and ordering of tissues, using an honest broker model. Through this mechanism, de-identified data and access to tissue can be shared among institutions, enabling multi-center collaborative research. The caTIES system has already been implemented at seven US Cancer Centers, and is being considered for adoption by numerous other institutions including cancer centers, university hospitals and private hospitals. Initial development of caTIES was funded by the Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG). However, interest in the application has far exceeded our expectations and the limitations of caBIG. This grant will allow us to further extend the capabilities of the system by (a) improving the portability of the system and extending the types of documents that can be processed, (b) evaluating the system's NLP performance and usability, (c) building a user community to support this open-source application, and (d) piloting interoperability of caTIES with other enterprise and research systems. This work will preserve and extend a highly novel platform for development of massive repositories of de-identified clinical data that can be used for research within and across institutions.

"Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection in the general population is growing significantly which is of great concern. The progression of the viral infection as well as treatment modality critically depends on the patient's stage of fibrosis. Thus, we need to be able to clearly distinguish between the five stages of liver fibrosis associated with HCV infection if we are to prescribe the proper treatment. Little is known about how HCV infection progresses to liver cancer in patients with advanced fibrosis, so one important goal of this project is to discover biomarkers for the detection of early stage liver cancer. The different stages of fibrosis associated with HCV infection will be compared to discover which proteins and metabolites are differentially expressed; the goal of which will be the development of a biomarker panel for fibrosis stage determination. Also, patient's proteomic and metabonomic responses to therapy will be examined to determine a priori which individuals will respond well to therapy. Patients with liver cancer will also be compared to HCV infected patients to develop a biomarker panel for the detection of early stage liver cancer. For the development of such biomarkers, Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/ lonization and metabonomics experiments will be conducted on serum and urine samples from infected patients. I will use classical methods of data analysis such as principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, neural networks, and logistic regression to create a first order biomarker panel. In phase two, I will utilize more sophisticated machine learning techniques such as kernel methods and support vector machines (SVM). My research will especially focus on making advances in SVMs to create high quality biomarker panels for HCV infection and disease progression. The specific aims are to 1) analyze the HCV data using classical techniques to identify proteins and metabolites which are differentially expressed in the various stages of fibrosis; 2) analyze the data using SVMs to more accurately classify the stage of fibrosis; 3) improve the SVM methodology to obtain a more reliable diagnostic of liver fibrosis stage; 4) analyze patient response to treatment using improved SVM techniques to determine which patients are more likely to respond to therapy; and 5) develop markers that distinguish cancer versus non-cancer patients with HCV from applications of SVMs.           n/a",Biomarker Discovery for Hepatitis C Progression using Machine Learning Techniques,7386231,K25CA127524,"['Advanced Development', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Hepatitis', 'Cirrhosis', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'career', 'experience', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein metabolite', 'racial difference', 'research study', 'response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K25,2008,126357,0.034502290503628234
"Combinatorial Genomics in Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted therapy of cancer requires a clear understanding of the genetic alterations that drive malignant cell growth. Identification of causal genetic alterations is complicated by three characteristics of cancer etiology: 1.) multiple interacting alterations are often required to cause cancer, 2.) several distinct alterations may be sufficient to generate a single cancer phenotype, and 3.) oncogenic alterations appear in a dense background of normal genetic activity and spurious consequences of malignant cell growth. We propose to apply a variant of the machine learning algorithm PRIM to the task of identifying disjunctive sets of conjunctive genetic alterations that cause specific cancers or provide prognostic information about clinical course and treatment efficacy. These analyses synthesize information from low-level bioinformatics resources we have already developed to map chromosomal alterations and monitor global patterns of transcription factor activity. Based on those foundations, the present studies develop high-level analytic tools to map combinatorial interactions among low-level genomic events. Specifically, these studies seek to: Aim 1: Develop graphical user interface (GUI) software to support combinatorial genomic analyses by biologists with limited computational background. Aim 2: Optimize combinatorial prediction of disease progression and treatment response. Aim 3: Develop PRIM-based statistical models to identify functional complementation groups of genetic alterations and transcriptional control signals. The bioinformatic tools produced in these studies will create a generalized analytic infrastructure for mapping complex etiologies in cancer and deploying patient-specific targeted therapies.          n/a",Combinatorial Genomics in Cancer,7477758,R01CA116778,"['Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'combinatorial', 'graphical user interface', 'prognostic', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2008,363604,0.05018267403104964
"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             n/a",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7499105,U24CA126561,"['Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feeds', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Molecular Target', 'Numbers', 'Public Health', 'Random Allocation', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Silver', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'cancer genome', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput technology', 'interest', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2008,773823,0.07553128919744838
"Visualization and Analysis of the TCGA Data Using the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browse    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project aims to determine the feasibility of identifying and cataloging the genomic-level alterations associated with human cancers, including alterations in DNA copy number and transcript levels, epigenetic modifications, cancer somatic mutations, and inherited genetic variance that contribute to cancer susceptibility. As experimental techniques for a comprehensive survey of the cancer landscape mature, there is a great demand in the cancer research field to develop advanced analysis and visualization tools for the characterization and integrative analysis of the large, complex genomic datasets arising from different technology platforms.    The proposed UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser is a suite of web-based tools designed to integrate, visualize and analyze genomic and clinical data generated by the TCGA project. The browser, which will be available at https://cancer.cse.ucsc.edu/, currently consists of three major components: hgHeatmap, hgFeatureSorter and hgPathSorter. The main panel, hgHeatmap, displays a whole-genome-oriented view of genome-wide experimental measurements for individual and sets of samples/patients along with their clinical information. hgFeatureSorter and hgPathSorter together enable investigators to order, filter, aggregate and display data interactively based on any given feature set ranging from clinical features to annotated biological pathways to user-edited collections of genes. Standard and advanced statistical tools will be installed on the server's side through a caBIG-compatible mechanism to provide quantitative analysis of the whole genomic data or any of its subsets. The UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser is an extension of the UCSC Genome Browser; thus it inherits and integrates the Genome Browser's existing rich set of human biology and genetics data to enhance the interpretability of the cancer genomic data. A pathway- centric, multi-layer machine learning algorithm, BioIntegrator, will be built on top of the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser for the integration of cancer genomics and clinical data to assess the levels of perturbation of biological pathways in cancers and during the course of therapy, and to predict clinical outcomes.    Collectively, these proposed tools will facilitate a synergistic interaction among clinicians, experimental biologists and bioinformaticians. They will enable cancer researchers to better explore the breadth and depth of the TCGA cancer genomics data resources, and to further characterize molecular pathways that influence cellular dynamics and stability in cancer. Ultimately, insights gained by applying these tools may advance our knowledge of human cancer biology and stimulate the discovery of new prognostic and diagnostic markers, as well as the development of therapeutic and prevention strategies.           n/a",Visualization and Analysis of the TCGA Data Using the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browse,7539926,R21CA135937,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Compatible', 'Complex', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Display', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Metadata', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Plug-in', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Range', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Side', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'design', 'insight', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'prognostic', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2008,215094,0.10339790762085552
"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objectives are (1) demonstrate computational and experimental methods cooperating to achieve a functional census of a large mutation sequence space of great medical importance; (2) contribute to our knowledge of p53 functional rescue mechanisms, and so facilitate the search for a small molecule cancer drug that effects an analogous functional rescue of p53; and (3) elucidate part of the systems biology of cancer by characterizing the spectrum of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants across known downstream p53 DNA binding sites. Mutations to the tumor suppressor protein p53 occur in approximately half of all human cancers, and restoring function to a mutationally defective p53 protein is a long-held medical goal. Biological precedence for rescuing p53 cancer mutations is found in second-site p53 cancer suppressor mutations. The analogous p53 pharmacological rescue would save hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Understanding and predicting p53 rescue is an important step toward that goal.      The specific aims are (1) computationally predict all single suppressor mutations for p53 cancer mutants and validate the results experimentally, (2) optimize the rescue effects of known and putative p53 suppressor regions through two or more coordinated mutation changes, and (3) predict and experimentally validate the DNA binding specificity of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants for known p53 DNA binding sites. Our broad strategy is a coordinated computational and experimental attack. We already have experimental p53 functional assays and computational predictors of p53 activity, developed as part of our Preliminary Studies. Computational predictors will be used to focus experimental work into the highest priority areas. Experimental validation of the predictions will lead to a larger training set for machine learning techniques. The larger training set will lead to even more accurate predictions, thus even more focused experimentation. Thus, the interplay between computation and experiment will become ever more efficient as the project progresses. Variations of this basic strategy apply to each of our Specific Aims, which all rely on closely coordinated experiment and computation. n/a",A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants,7426313,R01CA112560,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancerous', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Consensus', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proliferating', 'Protein p53', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Suppressor Mutations', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'functional restoration', 'interest', 'killings', 'mutant', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'transcription factor', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2008,335397,0.04925417657559257
"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths. This research will develop an innovative computational system with implications for early detection of cancer as well as potential recurrence and metastasis, leading to increased survival rates.

"GeneRx - colorectal cancer recurrence prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With a projected 55,170 deaths in the United States in 2006, colorectal cancer is second only to lung cancer as the most deadly. Patients with operable, but somewhat advanced, disease (stages II-III) are either observed only or treated with adjuvant therapy to reduce the chances of recurrence after surgery. Although chemotherapy is standard in stage II-III rectal and stage III colon cancer patients, the benefits are restricted to a relatively small fraction of patients. Adjuvant treatment of stage II colon cancer patients is particularly controversial due to the very small benefit in this group. Unfortunately, the prognostic power of simple clinicopathologic data is insufficient to identify high-risk stage II colon cancer patients--or low-risk rectal or stage III colon cancer patients. This proposal describes development of an individualized test based on the status of multiple molecular markers in the patient's tumor to provide an accurate prediction of the risk of recurrence. The molecular markers were carefully selected to provide broad coverage over a range of biological pathways with established prognostic potential. They will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in >600 stage II colorectal cancer patients. Pathologists will score up to 22 markers, as will an automated digital image analysis system for maximal objectivity. Statistical pattern recognition methods will then be used on the data to select a subset of the markers and clinicopathologic features that, when combined with an optimized machine learning algorithm, will produce an accurate model that predicts recurrence. Measuring proteins directly in tumor sections with IHC is arguably one the most relevant strategies available to assess patient prognosis and is widely accepted in the pathology community. Unlike IHC, competing methods like gene expression cannot directly assess protein levels or localization, and it is very difficult or impossible to distinguish normal from tumor cells in the homogenized tissue mixtures that are assayed. Furthermore, unlike most previous related studies, the informatic analyses proposed here include robust, powerful methods to discover complex interactions between markers--maximizing performance--while avoiding overfitting--maximizing the potential for generalizability. The proposed application of advanced quantitative scoring (for objective analysis) and cutting-edge informatics (for complex marker interaction elucidation) to the tried and true IHC protein staining technology is a highly innovative approach to the development of cancer prognostics. The ultimate product will consist of a panel of assays for the relevant molecular markers and the associated prognostic algorithm that predicts recurrence. Colorectal cancer patients and their oncologists will be able to use the results to guide their treatment decisions, resulting in positive impacts on life expectancy and quality of life. With the help of their oncologist, patients with newly diagnosed stage I-III colorectal cancer must decide whether to endure the potentially serious side effects of chemotherapy after surgery in the hopes of preventing a recurrence. However, the benefit of chemotherapy is restricted to a relatively small fraction of these patients, and the predictive ability of current clinical guidelines is relatively crude. The goal of this study is to develop an individualized test that will more accurately predict risk of recurrence based on advanced mathematical analysis of the status of multiple molecular markers within the patient's tumor. It should lead to improvements in both survival and quality of life for colorectal cancer patients.          n/a",GeneRx - colorectal cancer recurrence prediction,7477296,R44CA117001,"['Accounting', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Scoring Method', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer recurrence', 'chemotherapy', 'chromosome 22 supernumerary marker', 'clinically significant', 'cytotoxic', 'data integration', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'hazard', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'rectal', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R44,2008,289916,0.04818542656088591
"Reliable Performance of Cancer Screening using a Computer-based Monitoring System    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite their potential to reduce cancer burden through early detection, the effectiveness of screening programs is often undermined by systems-based factors and human factors. The broad aims of this application are to develop and evaluate a computer-based technology called TRACS to monitor the process of cancer screening in individual patients and intervene as necessary to ensure that the screening is conducted reliably and effectively. Interventions in TRACS consist of reliable notifications to clinicians and/or patients. However, unlike many other reminder systems, TRACS continues to monitor the care of the patient subsequent to the notification.       In this phase of the application, TRACS will be used to address the reliability of follow up of abnormal or equivocal results from screening mammography for breast cancer. A knowledge module will be created in TRACS knowledge base for the monitoring of the follow up of abnormal screening mammograms. A knowledge module comprises the process definition that specifies the appropriate course of actions for a clinical scenario and logical rules for making decisions within the process. In the next phase, additional knowledge modules will be included for comprehensive support for screening of breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colon cancer.       An important feature of TRACS will be the ability to extract information from clinical text documents using a natural language processing engine called HITex. Reports of several cancer screening tests, such as mammography, cervical smear, and colonoscopy, are in the form of text documents. Thus it is important to be able to extract relevant information from these documents for use by TRACS. HITex will be customized to extract the recommendations of the radiologist from screening mammogram reports. Specifically, it will extract whether the radiologist recommends a non-routine follow up. If that is the case, HITex will extract the recommended follow up (e.g., diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, or needle biopsy).       TRACS will be deployed and evaluated at the New England Medical Center (NEMC), a large urban medical center in Boston. The first step in the evaluation will be to confirm that information from screening mammogram reports from NEMC can be extracted accurately by HITex. During this phase, the TRACS software and the abnormal mammography follow up knowledge module will be tested in a simulated setting at NEMC. The tests will be conducted using records of patients who had previously undergone screening mammography at NEMC. The behavior of TRACS for these cases will be rated by a panel of experts from NEMC. In the next phase, TRACS will be deployed operationally at NEMC. Project Narrative The software proposed to being developed under this project aims to improve the early identification of a number of commonly occurring cancers. It will do so by following up reliably on the management of those patients that have abnormal results in cancer screening tests.          n/a",Reliable Performance of Cancer Screening using a Computer-based Monitoring System,7481710,R43CA134042,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Boston', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Closure', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Invasive', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Mammography', 'Medical center', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Notification', 'Numbers', 'Pap smear', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Process', 'Puncture biopsy', 'Rate', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reminder Systems', 'Reporting', 'Schedule', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Simulate', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'computer generated', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiologist', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'software development', 'software systems', 'tool']",NCI,U.S. CARELINK,R43,2008,122518,-0.03307701379667577
"Protein Biomarkers of Cancer Risk in Older Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The single greatest risk factor for cancer is aging. While aging and cancer involve common pathways, the intersection of these biologic processes is not well understood. A greater understanding of the relationship between aging and cancer is of paramount importance given the advancing age of the U.S. population. Currently 35 million Americans are over the age of 65, and this number is expected to double by 2030. The use of high throughput proteomic tools have the potential to advance our understanding of aging and cancer, as they have recently been shown to have the potential for providing highly accurate approaches for the early detection of prostate, ovarian, lung, and head/neck cancers. These studies have garnered considerable interest and enthusiasm given the potential impact early detection of different cancers, through the use of multiple new protein biomarkers, can have on reducing their mortalities and human and economic costs. However, the promise of proteomics can only be realized if these differences are also found in a prospective setting, where samples are obtained prior to the diagnosis of cancer. Existing cohort studies provide an ideal setting for evaluating whether or not current proteomic tools can be used to distinguish between those who will and will not develop cancer. Herein we propose a case-cohort study using a subset of subjects over 65 years of age who have participated in the Cardiovascular Health Study cohort since 1989. Using matrix-assisted laser desoprtion and ionization (MALDI) we will evaluate the proteome of plasma samples that were collected on these subjects at multiple time points. The hypotheses to be tested are: 1) Baseline plasma proteomic patterns can be used to distinguish between subjects who will and will not develop breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers; 2) Addition of known risk factors for different cancers to our proteomic algorithms will enhance their predictive power; 3) Identification of changes in proteomic patterns over time will enhance our understanding of aging and cancer, and improve the predictive power of this approach as a screening test for cancer; 4) Identification of the proteins that distinguish between subjects who did and did not develop these cancers will advance our understanding of their etiologies and possibly aid in their early detection.         n/a",Protein Biomarkers of Cancer Risk in Older Persons,7409617,R01CA116393,"['Accounting', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology of Aging', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorectal', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lasers', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Ovarian', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rate', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resistance', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Smoking History', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'human mortality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'ionization', 'men', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'tool']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2008,443168,-0.00659726597825085
"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges. Our ability to bring these opportunities to fruition depends on the development and application of sound and innovative statistical methods. Areas of particularly great need include methods for dealing with multiple hypothesis-testing problems (multiple comparison issues), and methods for combining data from multiple sources to achieve sharper inferences (data synthesis issues). The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer.

"Combinatorial Genomics in Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted therapy of cancer requires a clear understanding of the genetic alterations that drive malignant cell growth. Identification of causal genetic alterations is complicated by three characteristics of cancer etiology: 1.) multiple interacting alterations are often required to cause cancer, 2.) several distinct alterations may be sufficient to generate a single cancer phenotype, and 3.) oncogenic alterations appear in a dense background of normal genetic activity and spurious consequences of malignant cell growth. We propose to apply a variant of the machine learning algorithm PRIM to the task of identifying disjunctive sets of conjunctive genetic alterations that cause specific cancers or provide prognostic information about clinical course and treatment efficacy. These analyses synthesize information from low-level bioinformatics resources we have already developed to map chromosomal alterations and monitor global patterns of transcription factor activity. Based on those foundations, the present studies develop high-level analytic tools to map combinatorial interactions among low-level genomic events. Specifically, these studies seek to: Aim 1: Develop graphical user interface (GUI) software to support combinatorial genomic analyses by biologists with limited computational background. Aim 2: Optimize combinatorial prediction of disease progression and treatment response. Aim 3: Develop PRIM-based statistical models to identify functional complementation groups of genetic alterations and transcriptional control signals. The bioinformatic tools produced in these studies will create a generalized analytic infrastructure for mapping complex etiologies in cancer and deploying patient-specific targeted therapies.          n/a",Combinatorial Genomics in Cancer,7291530,R01CA116778,"['Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Disease Progression', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell growth', 'combinatorial', 'graphical user interface', 'prognostic', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,439085,0.05018267403104964
"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             n/a",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7294347,U24CA126561,"['Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feeds', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Hypermethylation', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Karyotype determination procedure', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Molecular Target', 'Numbers', 'Public Health', 'Random Allocation', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Silver', 'Site', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'cancer genome', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'high throughput technology', 'interest', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2007,766160,0.07553128919744838
"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objectives are (1) demonstrate computational and experimental methods cooperating to achieve a functional census of a large mutation sequence space of great medical importance; (2) contribute to our knowledge of p53 functional rescue mechanisms, and so facilitate the search for a small molecule cancer drug that effects an analogous functional rescue of p53; and (3) elucidate part of the systems biology of cancer by characterizing the spectrum of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants across known downstream p53 DNA binding sites. Mutations to the tumor suppressor protein p53 occur in approximately half of all human cancers, and restoring function to a mutationally defective p53 protein is a long-held medical goal. Biological precedence for rescuing p53 cancer mutations is found in second-site p53 cancer suppressor mutations. The analogous p53 pharmacological rescue would save hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Understanding and predicting p53 rescue is an important step toward that goal.      The specific aims are (1) computationally predict all single suppressor mutations for p53 cancer mutants and validate the results experimentally, (2) optimize the rescue effects of known and putative p53 suppressor regions through two or more coordinated mutation changes, and (3) predict and experimentally validate the DNA binding specificity of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants for known p53 DNA binding sites. Our broad strategy is a coordinated computational and experimental attack. We already have experimental p53 functional assays and computational predictors of p53 activity, developed as part of our Preliminary Studies. Computational predictors will be used to focus experimental work into the highest priority areas. Experimental validation of the predictions will lead to a larger training set for machine learning techniques. The larger training set will lead to even more accurate predictions, thus even more focused experimentation. Thus, the interplay between computation and experiment will become ever more efficient as the project progresses. Variations of this basic strategy apply to each of our Specific Aims, which all rely on closely coordinated experiment and computation. n/a",A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants,7253241,R01CA112560,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancerous', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Consensus', 'DNA Binding', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Numbers', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proliferating', 'Protein p53', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Suppressor Mutations', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'functional restoration', 'interest', 'killings', 'mutant', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'small molecule', 'transcription factor', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE,R01,2007,333814,0.04925417657559257
"GeneRx - colorectal cancer recurrence prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With a projected 55,170 deaths in the United States in 2006, colorectal cancer is second only to lung cancer as the most deadly. Patients with operable, but somewhat advanced, disease (stages II-III) are either observed only or treated with adjuvant therapy to reduce the chances of recurrence after surgery. Although chemotherapy is standard in stage II-III rectal and stage III colon cancer patients, the benefits are restricted to a relatively small fraction of patients. Adjuvant treatment of stage II colon cancer patients is particularly controversial due to the very small benefit in this group. Unfortunately, the prognostic power of simple clinicopathologic data is insufficient to identify high-risk stage II colon cancer patients--or low-risk rectal or stage III colon cancer patients. This proposal describes development of an individualized test based on the status of multiple molecular markers in the patient's tumor to provide an accurate prediction of the risk of recurrence. The molecular markers were carefully selected to provide broad coverage over a range of biological pathways with established prognostic potential. They will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in >600 stage II colorectal cancer patients. Pathologists will score up to 22 markers, as will an automated digital image analysis system for maximal objectivity. Statistical pattern recognition methods will then be used on the data to select a subset of the markers and clinicopathologic features that, when combined with an optimized machine learning algorithm, will produce an accurate model that predicts recurrence. Measuring proteins directly in tumor sections with IHC is arguably one the most relevant strategies available to assess patient prognosis and is widely accepted in the pathology community. Unlike IHC, competing methods like gene expression cannot directly assess protein levels or localization, and it is very difficult or impossible to distinguish normal from tumor cells in the homogenized tissue mixtures that are assayed. Furthermore, unlike most previous related studies, the informatic analyses proposed here include robust, powerful methods to discover complex interactions between markers--maximizing performance--while avoiding overfitting--maximizing the potential for generalizability. The proposed application of advanced quantitative scoring (for objective analysis) and cutting-edge informatics (for complex marker interaction elucidation) to the tried and true IHC protein staining technology is a highly innovative approach to the development of cancer prognostics. The ultimate product will consist of a panel of assays for the relevant molecular markers and the associated prognostic algorithm that predicts recurrence. Colorectal cancer patients and their oncologists will be able to use the results to guide their treatment decisions, resulting in positive impacts on life expectancy and quality of life. With the help of their oncologist, patients with newly diagnosed stage I-III colorectal cancer must decide whether to endure the potentially serious side effects of chemotherapy after surgery in the hopes of preventing a recurrence. However, the benefit of chemotherapy is restricted to a relatively small fraction of these patients, and the predictive ability of current clinical guidelines is relatively crude. The goal of this study is to develop an individualized test that will more accurately predict risk of recurrence based on advanced mathematical analysis of the status of multiple molecular markers within the patient's tumor. It should lead to improvements in both survival and quality of life for colorectal cancer patients.          n/a",GeneRx - colorectal cancer recurrence prediction,7272249,R44CA117001,"['Accounting', 'Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Formalin', 'Gene Expression', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Oncologist', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Range', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Scoring Method', 'Staging', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer recurrence', 'chemotherapy', 'chromosome 22 supernumerary marker', 'clinically significant', 'cytotoxic', 'data integration', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'hazard', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'rectal', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"PREDICTION SCIENCES, LLC",R44,2007,882531,0.04818542656088591
"Protein Biomarkers of Cancer Risk in Older Persons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The single greatest risk factor for cancer is aging.

"A Functional Census of p53 Cancer and Suppressor Mutants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objectives are (1) demonstrate computational and experimental methods cooperating to achieve a functional census of a large mutation sequence space of great medical importance; (2) contribute to our knowledge of p53 functional rescue mechanisms, and so facilitate the search for a small molecule cancer drug that effects an analogous functional rescue of p53; and (3) elucidate part of the systems biology of cancer by characterizing the spectrum of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants across known downstream p53 DNA binding sites. Mutations to the tumor suppressor protein p53 occur in approximately half of all human cancers, and restoring function to a mutationally defective p53 protein is a long-held medical goal. Biological precedence for rescuing p53 cancer mutations is found in second-site p53 cancer suppressor mutations. The analogous p53 pharmacological rescue would save hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Understanding and predicting p53 rescue is an important step toward that goal.      The specific aims are (1) computationally predict all single suppressor mutations for p53 cancer mutants and validate the results experimentally, (2) optimize the rescue effects of known and putative p53 suppressor regions through two or more coordinated mutation changes, and (3) predict and experimentally validate the DNA binding specificity of p53 cancer and suppressor mutants for known p53 DNA binding sites. Our broad strategy is a coordinated computational and experimental attack. We already have experimental p53 functional assays and computational predictors of p53 activity, developed as part of our Preliminary Studies. Computational predictors will be used to focus experimental work into the highest priority areas. Experimental validation of the predictions will lead to a larger training set for machine learning techniques. The larger training set will lead to even more accurate predictions, thus even more focused experimentation. Thus, the interplay between computation and experiment will become ever more efficient as the project progresses.

"Bayesian Methods for Longitudinal Cancer Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Longitudinal data arise frequently in the analysis of cancer studies. The goal of this proposal will be to develop new Bayesian models and methods to assist in the analysis of, and inference from, longitudinal cancer studies. These new developments can be categorized into four aims. The first aim will be to develop new (Bayesian) models for the analysis of discrete multivariate longitudinal data. This aim will build on recent innovative work by Heagerty and others for univariate longitudinal binary data by developing models for multivariate discrete longitudinal data that model marginal covariate effects directly and provide natural ways to model both temporal and multivariate dependence. The second aim will be to develop flexible and automated methods for subject specific and overall curve fitting in hierarchical models using free knots splines. Methods and RJMCMC algorithms will be proposed that extend and improve current methods in at least three ways: 1) allow different knots for the fixed and random components of the subject-specific curves, 2) properly account for the variability of the between subject covariance matrix, and 3) provide a natural setup for dimension reduction for the random components of the subject-specific curves. Several applications of these methods will be developed, including using this methodology to evaluate cancer biomarkers through joint longitudinal/survival models. The third aim will address modeling dependence across groups and these ideas will be combined with those in aim 1 to construct models for mixed multivariate longitudinal data. Modeling dependence correctly is very important for inference in the presence of missing data that is missing at random and/or non-ignorable. The fourth aim will develop flexible Bayesian semi-parametric selection models for longitudinal data with non-ignorable missingness. This will build on recent work by the Principal Investigator's who constructed such models in the non-longitudinal setting without covariates. An important feature of these models will be the preservation of the marginal distribution of the observed data. Many of the methods proposed here are partially motivated by two recently completed cancer clinical trials; a large colorectal cancer clinical trial and a large breast cancer prevention trial. These methods will be illustrated on the data from these trials and will allow specific questions from these trials to be answered, including a comparison of the longitudinal trajectories of quality of life across treatments in both trials, with the breast cancer trial offering the additional complication of having a lot of dropout, thought to be informative.                      n/a",Bayesian Methods for Longitudinal Cancer Data,7029008,R01CA085295,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomarker', 'breast neoplasms', 'cancer prevention', 'clinical research', 'clinical trials', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'computer data analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'human data', 'long term survivor', 'longitudinal human study', 'mathematical model', 'method development', 'model design /development', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'neoplasm /cancer therapy', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2006,123264,-0.01137774408870526
"Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Yale SPORE in Skin Cancer program is focused on two skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and melanoma. The goals are to conduct epidemiologic and genetic studies on early onset basal cell carcinoma (Project 1), establish novel high-throughput prognostic and diagnostic tools for melanomas (Projects 2 and 4), and introduce novel targeted therapies to treat melanoma (Projects 2 and 3). The new approaches include genome-wide monitoring of melanoma tumor responses to epigenetic modifiers (Project 2); the use of high-density protein microarrays (ProtoArrays) to interrogate serological responses in sera from melanoma patients (Project 4); and novel epigenetic modifier and immune modulation therapy for melanoma (Projects 2 and 3, respectively).

"Combinatorial Genomics in Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Targeted therapy of cancer requires a clear understanding of the genetic alterations that drive malignant cell growth. Identification of causal genetic alterations is complicated by three characteristics of cancer etiology: 1.) multiple interacting alterations are often required to cause cancer, 2.) several distinct alterations may be sufficient to generate a single cancer phenotype, and 3.) oncogenic alterations appear in a dense background of normal genetic activity and spurious consequences of malignant cell growth. We propose to apply a variant of the machine learning algorithm PRIM to the task of identifying disjunctive sets of conjunctive genetic alterations that cause specific cancers or provide prognostic information about clinical course and treatment efficacy. These analyses synthesize information from low-level bioinformatics resources we have already developed to map chromosomal alterations and monitor global patterns of transcription factor activity. Based on those foundations, the present studies develop high-level analytic tools to map combinatorial interactions among low-level genomic events. Specifically, these studies seek to: Aim 1: Develop graphical user interface (GUI) software to support combinatorial genomic analyses by biologists with limited computational background. Aim 2: Optimize combinatorial prediction of disease progression and treatment response. Aim 3: Develop PRIM-based statistical models to identify functional complementation groups of genetic alterations and transcriptional control signals. The bioinformatic tools produced in these studies will create a generalized analytic infrastructure for mapping complex etiologies in cancer and deploying patient-specific targeted therapies.          n/a",Combinatorial Genomics in Cancer,7213111,R01CA116778,"['bioinformatics', 'clinical research', 'genetics', 'neoplasm /cancer']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2006,274238,0.05018267403104964
"Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This proposal describes a detailed plan for a Cancer Genome Characterization Center (CGCC) to act as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. This CGCC will contribute two platforms to accurately analyze over 1,000 cancer genomes per year using two of the most efficient and informative technologies currently available. In Specific Aim 1 we propose the first platform, a whole genome analysis of copy number changes using Illumina BeadArray(tm) technology. The Illumina 550,000 SNP BeadChip will be used to create high- resolution copy number maps of whole cancer genomes. Our side-by- side comparison of the current 300,000 SNP BeadChip to Digital Karyotyping shows that it provides higher resolution at a dramatically lower cost. Our data show that this technology can be used to accurately detect deletions and amplifications, powerful indicators of genes of interest. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the CpG island hypermethylome in human cancer. Leading experts in the field of cancer epigenetics have a proven approach to define the set of possible genes that have expression silencing as a result of hypermethylation. This assay will again use the Illumina technology for high-throughput and accurate assay of functionally selected 5' CpG islands across the genome, as well as all CpG islands located on chromosomes 21 and 22, and a random selection of non- CpG island CpG sites located on these two chromosomes. In addition to DNA mutations and structural changes, DNA methylation is a significant cause of abnormal gene silencing linked to the development of cancer. In the informatics and data verification proposed in Specific Aim 3 we have developed an integrated approach to organized transmission of raw and verified data to the NCICB Data Coordinating Center using CaBIG-compliant data feeds. We will also make available data analysis tools developed as part of this project. These include means to integrate diverse genomic data from normal and cancer genomes, user- friendly visualization tools, web portals for data sharing, and use machine learning to derive systems biology correlates among available TCGA data, all designed for CaBIG silver or better compliance. Upon successful completion of these aims, we will have a rapid and efficient means to assay tens of thousands of cancer genomes, and rapidly produce biologically meaningful data on copy number changes and hypermethylation. This project has direct relevance to public health. Precise knowledge of the type and frequency of the major cancer causing alterations will allow the best molecular targets to be selected for new therapy development.             n/a",Cancer Genome Characterization Center at Johns Hopkins,7233923,U24CA126561,"['CpG islands', 'clinical research', 'genome', 'neoplasm /cancer']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U24,2006,781539,0.07553128919744838

"EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS NEOPLASIA    DESCRIPTION  (Applicant's  Description):    The  cell  lineages  in neoplastic       tissues are evolving under the twin dynamics of mutation and clonal expansion.       This  is the basis for both its virulence and our difficulties in treating it.       We  hypothesize  that a subset of the mutations observed in the progression to       cancer  confer  beneficial  selective  effects  on  the cell.  Furthermore, we       hypothesize  that  the  interactions  between  these clonal populations in and       around  the neoplastic tissue determine the progression to cancer.  The aim of       this  project  is  to  identify  these  selective  mutations  and to infer the       interactions  between the mutant clones in Barrett's Esophagus that eventually       lead  to  the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.  This analysis will be       based  on loss of heterozygosity data, promoter methylation, single nucleotide       polymorphisms,  and  gene  expression  data  for homogeneous subpopulations of       cells  sampled  from  neoplastic  tissue in patients with Barrett's Esophagus.       The  tissue  samples  come  from  biopsies of selected patients in the Seattle       Barrett's  Esophagus  Project  (N=285).   Data mining will be used to identify       mutations  that  are associated with clonal expansion as well as inhibition of       neighboring  clones.    The  order  of  genetic  events  in the progression to       esophageal adenocarcinoma will be determined by phylogenetic reconstruction of       the  cell lineages in the neoplastic tissue of each patient.  Machine learning       techniques,  such  as the EM algorithm, will be employed to infer missing data       and the effects of unsampled mutations. Computational modeling will be used to       generate   comparison  data  for  null  hypotheses  as  well  as  to  generate       experimental  predictions from our understanding of the progression to cancer.       This  is  the first step in my long-term career goal to contribute to medicine       through the use of computational and theoretical methods.  Working at the Fred       Hutchinson  Cancer  Research  Center  will  facilitate  the transition from my       background  in  computer  science  and  evolutionary theory, to an independent       research  program  based on the analysis of cellular and molecular dynamics of       cancer.

"Rapid Cancer-Treatment Efficacy Monitoring System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Evaluating cancer therapy efficacy by studying symptomatic improvement in patient condition is a popular practice due to the lack of rapid, reliable and robust quantitative evaluation protocols for routine clinical measurement of cancer therapy efficacy. Reducing time required for arriving at decisions and reducing cost without compromising accuracy could provide potentially improved treatments especially for patients with advanced leukemia of various types. This proposal focuses on rapid quantitative assessment of cancer treatment efficacy for leukemia. The proposed approach is based on quantifying apoptosis (programmed cell death) and has been shown to be one of the most reliable and one of the earliest indicators for assessing anticancer efficacy of a drug. Several other techniques are available to detect apoptosis (Agarose gel electrophoresis, Caspase-3, TUNEL assay, Morphological estimation, Annexin V assays etc). However, these techniques are inaccurate, expensive or time consuming.      A recently developed a two stage DNA diffusion assay holds promise to be an accurate, relatively inexpensive and rapid methodology for quantitative apoptosis measurement via the apoptotic index. The two stages are:(1) slide preparation and microscopy imaging, which requires approximately 1.5 hrs and (2) image analysis, which is tedious, and takes approximately 2 hours of additional intensive manual labor leading to errors in categorization of the cells. We propose to fully automate the second stage with the goal to minimize manual effort and there by reduce the human errors. This would also make the procedure more reproducible. Phase I work will involve: (1) segmentation and classification algorithm development for automatic apoptotic index calculation, and (2) characterizing the algorithm performance by inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells in culture using known apoptosis inducing agents. n/a",Rapid Cancer-Treatment Efficacy Monitoring System,6643057,R43CA101292,"['apoptosis', ' artificial intelligence', ' automated health care system', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical automation', ' computer program /software', ' fluorescence microscopy', ' image processing', ' leukemia', ' patient care management', ' prognosis', ' technology /technique development', ' tissue /cell culture']",NCI,INSIGHTFUL CORPORATION,R43,2003,99644,0.019018134227410482

"Colon Cancer Networks: Linking Modeling to Experiment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Development of computational models of signal transduction pathways implicated in colon cancer is proposed. These models give insight into the pathway's dynamical behavior and elucidate their roles in activating known oncogenic target genes. The project will model the Ras Map Kinase signal transduction pathway, which plays a central role in the development of colon cancer. The methods utilized, which will be further developed, combine computational modeling with experiments so that unknown parameters in the model are constrained. The goal is to create accurate, predictive models by combining the forward modeling approach with experimental data. The computational and experimental processes developed can be applied to other pathways implicated in colon cancer.   Accurate computational models of signaling pathways will bring rational, predictive science to the drug discovery process and lead to effective therapies for colon cancer. These simulations will help pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies prioritize drug targets, test the effects of lead compounds, and focus and direct laboratory efforts.   Specific aims are (1) to develop a detailed mathematical and computational model of the Ras Map Kinase pathway; (2) to conduct experiments on pathway components to extract the data needed to constrain parameters in the model; (3) to use and devise optimization algorithms to constrain parameters in the model and (4) generate predictions from the model.  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: The research will provide an in silico simulation of the gene expression networks and signal transduction controlling the onset of colon cancer. New methods will be developed for incorporating data into the in silico platform  generated by DNA microarrays, proteomics technologies, structural genomics, and protein-protein interaction studies to prioritize known drug targets. New mathematical analysis will make it possible to evaluate targets and lead compounds for drug development. n/a",Colon Cancer Networks: Linking Modeling to Experiment,6550604,R43CA094702,"['artificial intelligence', ' biological signal transduction', ' carcinogenesis', ' colon neoplasms', ' colorectal neoplasms', ' computer simulation', ' epidermal growth factor', ' guanine nucleotide binding protein', ' mathematical model', ' mitogen activated protein kinase', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplastic cell', ' northern blottings', ' oncogenes', ' tissue /cell culture']",NCI,"GENE NETWORK SCIENCES, INC.",R43,2002,100000,0.014759870950946115

"EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS NEOPLASIA    DESCRIPTION  (Applicant's  Description):    The  cell  lineages  in neoplastic       tissues are evolving under the twin dynamics of mutation and clonal expansion.       This  is the basis for both its virulence and our difficulties in treating it.       We  hypothesize  that a subset of the mutations observed in the progression to       cancer  confer  beneficial  selective  effects  on  the cell.  Furthermore, we       hypothesize  that  the  interactions  between  these clonal populations in and       around  the neoplastic tissue determine the progression to cancer.  The aim of       this  project  is  to  identify  these  selective  mutations  and to infer the       interactions  between the mutant clones in Barrett's Esophagus that eventually       lead  to  the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma.  This analysis will be       based  on loss of heterozygosity data, promoter methylation, single nucleotide       polymorphisms,  and  gene  expression  data  for homogeneous subpopulations of       cells  sampled  from  neoplastic  tissue in patients with Barrett's Esophagus.       The  tissue  samples  come  from  biopsies of selected patients in the Seattle       Barrett's  Esophagus  Project  (N=285).   Data mining will be used to identify       mutations  that  are associated with clonal expansion as well as inhibition of       neighboring  clones.    The  order  of  genetic  events  in the progression to       esophageal adenocarcinoma will be determined by phylogenetic reconstruction of       the  cell lineages in the neoplastic tissue of each patient.  Machine learning       techniques,  such  as the EM algorithm, will be employed to infer missing data       and the effects of unsampled mutations. Computational modeling will be used to       generate   comparison  data  for  null  hypotheses  as  well  as  to  generate       experimental  predictions from our understanding of the progression to cancer.       This  is  the first step in my long-term career goal to contribute to medicine       through the use of computational and theoretical methods.  Working at the Fred       Hutchinson  Cancer  Research  Center  will  facilitate  the transition from my       background  in  computer  science  and  evolutionary theory, to an independent       research  program  based on the analysis of cellular and molecular dynamics of       cancer.  The challenge of this project is the integration of diverse molecular       and  epidemiological  data  into  a coherent and detailed understanding of the       progression to cancer in the neoplasm of a model system.                                                                                                                                                                                                       n/a",EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF BARRETT'S ESOPHAGUS NEOPLASIA,6229855,K01CA089267,"['Barretts esophagus', ' adenocarcinoma', ' cell cell interaction', ' clinical research', ' gene expression', ' gene mutation', ' human subject', ' loss of heterozygosity', ' mathematical model', ' microarray technology', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer genetics', ' neoplastic growth', ' neoplastic process', ' telomere']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,K01,2001,118630,0.051791274952525605
"ANN SOFTWARE FOR EARLY DETECTION OF OVARIAN CANCER Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer in the US. For most patients, the disease is first diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the 5-year survival rate is low (< 30%). Despite incremental improvement in chemotherapy, the cure rate has not improved significantly in the past decades, The dramatic difference in long-term survival between patients with local disease (80-90%) and those with distant metastases (5-20%) suggests the need for a non-invasive, yet effective test applicable to at-risk population groups to detect ovarian cancer in early stages. Building upon prior research in differentiating malignant from benign ovarian masses, this project seeks to apply artificial neural network (ANN) technology to the problem of screening for early-stage ovarian cancer based on a variety of serum markers and other clinical inputs. The recently completed Phase I pilot project validated the feasibility by (1) assembling existing data from collaborating Organizations, (2) analyzing the predictive value of relevant biomarkers, (3) developing a preliminary ANN, and (4) validating the ANN using independent test data. The successful completion of Phase I now facilitates the commencement of Phase II activities to develop a production version of the screening system and to initiate broad-scale validation through multiple clinical studies. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: ANN software capable of detecting early-stage ovarian cancer with sufficient improvement in specificity, sensitivity, and predictive value over alternative techniques would have clear commercial value in screening high-risk populations. Horns presently offers as a commercial product an Internet-based clinical information processing service, called ProstAsure, developed using ANN technology, for the detection of prostate cancer.  n/a",ANN SOFTWARE FOR EARLY DETECTION OF OVARIAN CANCER,6211886,R44CA080459,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomarker', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' early diagnosis', ' human data', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' ovary neoplasms']",NCI,"HORUS GLOBAL HEALTHNET, INC.",R44,2000,585610,0.0028487038554889945
"EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE FOR TUMOR HETEROGENEITY   DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Description)  In this renewal application, we seek        support for development and evaluation of several novel educational                  applications of the Oncology Thinking Cap (OncoTCap), a computer system that         provides an extensive and highly flexible cancer modeling laboratory enabling        a range of educational interventions.  The heart of OncoTCap is a pair of            computational engines that simulate the evolution of heterogeneous tumors,           based on an economical description of biological assumptions.  Populations can       be observed to evolve and respond to cancer treatments, OncoTCap also includes       a set of interface programs that support the system's use by educators,              trainees, and researchers.  These interfaces can be used to promote                  understanding of important issues of cancer treatment and to support                 hypothesis generation.                                                                                                                                                    Building on the work performed under our initial grant, we are poised to make        highly significant expansions in OncoTCap's capabilities, in regard to               modeling power and new or improved interfaces.  The expansions will, in turn,        allow us to develop and evaluate new and augmented interventions in cancer           education to enhance basic science research, clinical research, and patient          care.

"TISSUE AND SERUM INDICATORS OF LUNG CANCER RECURRENCE Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer morality       in men and women in the United States, and the overall long-term survial is      less than 15%.  Pathologic stage I makes up  25-35% of NSCLC cases and has       a good prognosis.  However, cancer relapse and death rate in this subset is      35 to 50% by 5 years.  Chemotherapy is beneficial for the treatment of           several localized solid tumors after resection and may prove to be useful        in the treatment of patients with stage I NSCLC.  Thr purpose of this            project is to define tissue and serum tumor markers in patients with stage       I NSCLC which predict for early cancer recurrence.  Pathologic stage I           NSCLC was chosen for study to eliminate the significant influence of             positive lymph nodes and distant metastases on survival.                         Immunohistochemical staining will identify potential tissue tumor markers        and radioimmunoassay (RIA) or enzyme-link immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will       identify potential serum tumor markers.                                                                                                                           Specific aim #1 will examine a set of twelve tissue tumor markers in a           retrospective cohort of 275 stage I NSCLC patients.  Markers are                 categorized by hypothetical method of action: molecular genetic markers          (Kras, erbB-1, erbB-2, rb, p53, bcl-2), markers of metastatic propensity         (angiogenesis factor viii), proliferation markers (K1-67) and markers of         cellular differentiation (Blood group A, H/LeV/LeB, NCAM, CD44).  Results        will be used to develop a prediction rule for recurrence in stage I NSCLC        using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis and an artificial neural      network.                                                                                                                                                          Specific aim #2 will examine a set of eight serum tumor markers in a             retrospective cohort of 250 patients with stage I to IV NSCLC.  These            markers are categorized as molecular genetic markers (anti-p53), markers of      metastatic propensity (angiogenesis bFGF), somatamedins (growth factor IGF-      1) and markers of cellular differentiation (CEA, CA-125, CA 15-3, CYFRA21-       1, CD44).  The purpose of this aim is to identify any correlations between       titers of serum markers and tumor histology, stage or mass.  One hundred         patients in this cohort had a second serum collection after tumor                resection.  This subgroup of serum will allow analyses of titters before         and after cyto-reduction.  Significant correlates with tumor stage and mass      will be evaluated in a prospective cohort of patients with stage I NSCLC.                                                                                         In specific aim #3, paraffin-embedded and fresh-frozen tumor tissue will be      collected from a prospective cohort of 330 patients with stage I NSCLC to        validate the prediction rule developed in specific aim #1.  In these same        patients, serial serum specimens will be collected for a minimum of 2.0          years after resection (specific aim #4).  The significant markers                identified in specific aim #2 will be analyzed in this cohort to describe        correlations with tumor recurrence.  Tissue and serum markers identified by      the model can be used to select high risk patients for a prospective,            multi-institutional chemotherapy trial for stage I NSCLC.                         n/a",TISSUE AND SERUM INDICATORS OF LUNG CANCER RECURRENCE,6172943,R29CA073980,"['angiogenesis factor', ' artificial intelligence', ' biomarker', ' cell differentiation', ' clinical research', ' enzyme linked immunosorbent assay', ' genetic markers', ' histopathology', ' human subject', ' immunocytochemistry', ' insulinlike growth factor', ' longitudinal human study', ' mathematical model', ' metastasis', ' neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', ' neoplasm /cancer relapse /recurrence', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer', ' prognosis', ' respiratory surgery', ' serology /serodiagnosis']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R29,2000,105136,-0.005702860551190892
"Developing deep learning models for precision oncology Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this study is to develop machine learning methods, especially deep learning models (DLMs), to learn a better representation of activation states of cellular signaling pathways in an individual tumor and use such information to predict its sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. Cancer is mainly caused by somatic genome alterations (SGAs) that perturb cellular signaling pathways, and aberrations in pathways eventually lead to cancer development. Precision oncology aims to accurately detect and target tumor-specific aberrations, but challenges remain. Currently, there is no well-established method to detect the activation states of signaling pathways, and the common practice of using mutation status of a targeted gene as the indicator for prescribing a molecularly targeted drug has limitations. To overcome such limitation, we hypothesize that, by closely simulating the hierarchical organization of cellular signaling systems, DLMs can be used to systematically identify major cancer signaling pathways, to detect tumor-specific aberrations in signaling pathways, and to predict cancer cell sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs.  We will develop models that more precisely represent the state of signaling systems in cancer cells and use such information to enhance precision oncology. I will design and apply innovative DLMs to cancer big data, including large-scale pharmacogenomic data and cancer omics data to learn unified representation of aberrations in signaling systems caused by driver SGAs in cancer cell, despite of their different growth conditions, such as in cell culture, PDX and real tumor. This will enable us to transfer the models trained using cell lines and PDXs to clinical setting (real tumors) in future. By the nature of drugs that may share common target proteins, we develop model DLM-MLT (the combination of DLM and multi-task learning) to predict the sensitivity of tumor samples to multiple drugs at once. Furthermore, we will develop model BioSI-DLM to use various perturbations (ex. SGA/LINCS perturbation data) as side information to learn better representation that potentially map latent variables in a DLM to biological entities. We hypothesize that the representation learned from our designed models will significantly improve the prediction accuracy compared with the conventional indication for drug treatment (ex. mutation state of the drug targeting protein). In summary, our study uses deep learning based machine learning methods to learn better and concise representation embedded in the cancer omics data to reflect the personalized genomic changes, which could be used to guide the personalized treatment. Our study could significantly contribute to the development of cancer ontology and promote the development of precision medicine. Project Narrative Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. The proposed project aims to develop machine learning methods, especially deep learning, to study cellular signaling systems and disease mechanism. A better representation embedded in the cancer omics data will improve the prediction of drug sensitivity and patient survival. Our study promotes the development of precision medicine to guide the personalized treatment based on patient’s unique genetic changes.",Developing deep learning models for precision oncology,9892632,K99LM013089,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Ontology', 'PIK3CA gene', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'molecular drug target', 'molecular phenotype', 'multi-task learning', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'response', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2020,93908,0.06356175367962769
"Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This UG3/UH3 proposal titled “Natural Language Processing Platform for Cancer Surveillance” is in response to Research Area 1 of PAR 16-349 (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-16-349.html) specifically addressing the development of natural language processing (NLP) tools to facilitate automatic/unsupervised/minimally supervised extraction of specific discrete cancer-related data from various types of unstructured electronic medical records (EMRs) related to the activities of cancer registries. It is submitted through a multi-PI mechanism – Prof. Guergana Savova from Boston Children’s Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Dr. Jeremy Warner from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Prof. Harry Hochheiser from the University of Pittsburgh, and Prof. Eric Durbin from the Kentucky Cancer Registry/University of Kentucky. The current proposal builds on prior work funded by the NCI Informatics Tools for Cancer Research (ITCR) program (https://itcr.cancer.gov/ ). We envision building on our work to date to advance methods for information extraction of clinical phenotyping data needed to fuel a new cancer surveillance paradigm that would benefit hospital-based, state-based, and national cancer registries. In this new paradigm, surveillance programs would use the methods to enhance the speed, accuracy, and ease of cancer reporting. The proposed DeepPhe*CR platform could be deployed at local sites or centrally, and could eventually be integrated into existing or new visualization and abstraction tools as needed by the cancer surveillance community. Although there has been some previous work on automatic phenotype extraction from the various streams of data including the clinical narrative for specific types of cancer or individual variables for cancer surveillance, the proposed work will be a step towards a generalizable information extraction. This generalizability enables extensibility and scalability. Interoperability is reinforced through the modeling part of the proposed project which is grounded in most recent advances in biomedical ontologies, terminologies, community-adopted conventions and standards. Our planned partnership with three SEER cancer registries provides our decision-making processes with a solid foundation in large-scale cancer surveillance.

"A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis, thus aiding in improving the quality of both cancer research and clinical practice. Since diagnostic errors can cause altered treatment recommendations and significant patient harm, tools that semi-automate the diagnostic process to improve efficiency, reliability and accuracy are thus needed by both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. Our work will produce a set of machine-learning tools to identify regions of interest (ROI), classify these regions into the full spectrum of diagnostic categories (ranging from benign, to pre-invasive/risk lesions, to invasive cancer), and culminate in the development of a unified software package for cancer diagnosis that can be shared among cancer researchers and clinicians. Our aims are: Aim 1: Regions of Interest. Produce 1a) a ROI finder classifier and associated tools for use by researchers or pathologists for automatic identification of potential ROIs on whole slide images of breast biopsy slides and 1b) a ROI analysis classifier and associated tools that can point out image regions that tend to cause misdiagnosis and produce suitable warnings as to why such regions may either be distractors or indicate cancer. Aim 2: Diagnosis. Produce a diagnostic classifier and associated tools that can not only suggest the potential diagnosis of a whole slide image, but can also produce the reasons for the diagnosis in terms of regions on the image, their color, their texture, and their structure. Aim 3: Dissemination. Develop a unified software package containing this suite of tools, so they can be easily shared and provided (standalone and through the existing PIIP platform) to both cancer researchers and clinical pathologists. In addition to specific classifiers for breast cancer research, we will provide the methodology to train related classifiers for other biopsy- diagnosed cancers, such as melanoma, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. Our highly innovative diagnostic tools will include our state-of-the-art (2017) feature extraction and machine learning methods as opposed to the generic image management tools of the current ITCR projects. Our classifiers were trained on a unique data set acquired in a carefully designed breast cancer research study, so they are immediately useful in the breast cancer domain, but designed to be easily retrained for other data sets and cancers. The addition of our unique multi-disciplinary team and these tools to the ITCR program will be an important aid to cancer research and will improve the process of diagnosis for clinicians. Quality medical care requires an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic errors lead to lower quality research and can lead to reduced quality of care and inappropriate treatment decisions that result in harm to patients. Our team will develop a unified software package for sharing image analysis and machine learning tools to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and will share these tools with cancer researchers and pathologists on a publicly available platform.",A Unified Machine Learning Package for Cancer Diagnosis,9997819,U01CA231782,"['Age', 'Atypia', 'Behavior', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast biopsy', 'Carcinoma', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'E-learning', 'Funding', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Marketing', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Second Opinions', 'Slide', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Woman', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'anticancer research', 'breast cancer diagnosis', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer invasiveness', 'clinical practice', 'computer program', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'experience', 'feature extraction', 'imaging informatics', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'multidisciplinary', 'pathology imaging', 'programs', 'research study', 'screening', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U01,2020,323139,-0.023181608080752248
"Deep learning of drug sensitivity and genetic dependency of pediatric cancer cells Summary/Abstract The development of novel therapies for pediatric cancers, the second leading cause of death in children, is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive pharmacogenomics resources, unlike the well-established ones in adult cancers. However, breakthroughs in deep learning methods allow learning of intricate pharmacogenomics patterns with unprecedented performance. With a uniquely cross-disciplinary background, the candidate for this proposed K99/R00 has already, as a postdoctoral fellow, (i) developed and published several deep learning models that accurately predicted adult cancer cells’ drug sensitivity and genetic dependency using high- throughput genomics profiles, and (ii) demonstrated the feasibility of transferring the model to predict tumors by a ‘transfer learning’ design. The candidate will extend this research to study pediatric cancers and test the central hypothesis that deep learning extracts genomics signatures to predict the responses of pediatric cancer cells to chemical and genetic perturbations. The proposed study will develop novel deep learning models for predicting drug sensitivity and/or genetic dependency for (Aim 1) currently un-screened pediatric cancer cell lines by learning from screens of adult cells, and (Aim 2) pediatric tumors by learning from adult and/or pediatric cells. Prediction results will be validated by in vitro experiments and data collected from patient-derived xenografts. The proposed study is the first attempt to employ modern computational methods to advance pharmacogenomics studies of pediatric cancer, which would be difficult and costly to pursue via biological assays. Findings will shed light on the optimal drugs and novel therapeutic targets for pediatric malignancies, leading to an optimal and efficient design of preclinical tests. The candidate has a remarkable track record of bioinformatics studies of adult cancer genomics. The focus of this K99 training plan is to develop in-depth understanding of pediatric cancer and preclinical treatment models, and strengthen multifaceted components needed for a successful research career in cancer bioinformatics. The primary mentor, Dr. Peter Houghton, is a renowned leader in pediatric cancer research and preclinical drug testing programs. The candidate also has assembled an outstanding mentor team: Dr. Yidong Chen (co-mentor), a cancer genomics expert and pioneer in bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput technologies; Dr. Jinghui Zhang (collaborator), a computational biologist and leader in integrative genomics studies of major pediatric cancer genome consortiums; Dr. Yufei Huang (collaborator), an expert in state-of-the-art deep learning methods; and two highly knowledgeable consultants with relevant expertise. With this team’s guidance and structured training activities in an ideal training environment, the candidate will strengthen his skills in grant writing and lab management, teaching and mentoring, and broad connections. Overall, the K99/R00 award will be an indispensable support for a timely transition of the candidate to a successful career as a multifaceted, cross-disciplinary investigator in cancer bioinformatics. Narrative Pediatric cancer is the second leading cause of death in children, and genetic studies to inform new drug therapies have been challenging. The proposal will utilize deep learning bioinformatics methods to transfer well-established pharmacogenomics knowledge for adult cancers to the study of pediatric cancers. The findings will facilitate the optimal usage of existing drugs and the development of novel therapies for pediatric cancer, and will facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career as an expert in this area.",Deep learning of drug sensitivity and genetic dependency of pediatric cancer cells,9953691,K99CA248944,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cause of Death', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'In Vitro', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Screening for cancer', 'Seasons', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translations', 'Writing', 'Xenograft procedure', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'career', 'chemical genetics', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'experimental study', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'genomic profiles', 'genomic signature', 'high dimensionality', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput technology', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knockout gene', 'learning strategy', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,K99,2020,106607,0.04709111831896734
"Topic 412: CHAMP-WARE: Continuous Health Monitoring and Predictions using a Wearables-Agnostics Platform for Cancer Patients, Phase I Commercially available off-the-shelves (COTS) wearables that objectively track physiological variables offer a rich source of information about a patient’s health to clinicians and oncology researchers, to facilitate early adverse-event detection and subsequent management, which can decrease healthcare costs and improve patient quality of life. The passive, continuously measured data streams generated by current or future COTS sensors will allow direct/indirect measures of cancer progression and its symptoms. Increased out-of-clinic patient and clinician engagement via these tools will allow more precise delivery of cancer care after as well as during cancer remission. Ultimately, these passive sensing platforms’ data for digital biomarkers will afford clinicians: 1) more objective metrics of response to therapeutics; 2) control and autoreporting of symptoms and their fluctuations; 3) monitoring of side-effects of experimental or standard of care therapies; and 4) more ecologically valid clinical endpoints, all decreasing assessment burden via increased continuity of physiological measurement sampling and patient context in the ambulatory setting. Furthermore, such data present an opportunity to measure population-based statistics from large cohorts of cancer patients by way of the myriad of devices currently available or being developed. Unfortunately, despite the availability of a myriad of COTS wearables capable of measuring physiological variables, their use for remote cancer patient monitoring or for out-of-clinic cancer research is yet to become mainstream. There is a considerable need for scalable informatics tools that allow automated data aggregation, integration and machine learning/artificial intelligence (AI)/predictive analytics that can pull from disparate data sets across COTS device vendors and have the flexibility to add new measures as they are developed. Furthermore, a central software platform is needed that could obtain wearable or external device data and uniformly compare/contrast/couple data streams to understand physiology versus patient context with respect to time: such a capability will substantially advance this unique approach to aid cancer patients, clinician assessment and clinical trial design. This work seeks to overcome these bottlenecks and provide a workflow and an infrastructure for out-of-clinic remote patient monitoring and online research collaboration for advancing population-based research. By developing a software system, comprised of a smartphone app, database, and a Web portal, which can a) collect and standardize raw sensor data from multitude of wearables, b) perform intelligent multi-sensor data analytics to provide clinically relevant outcomes in real time, c) store these data in a common repository, and d) provide online interfaces to view and analyze data, the proposed effort will significantly advance out-of-clinic cancer research and patient monitoring. n/a","Topic 412: CHAMP-WARE: Continuous Health Monitoring and Predictions using a Wearables-Agnostics Platform for Cancer Patients, Phase I",10265744,5N91020C00057,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Remission', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Documentation', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Research', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'cancer care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data standards', 'data streams', 'data visualization', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'population based', 'prototype', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'side effect', 'smartphone Application', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'web portal']",NCI,"INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION, INC.",N43,2020,399980,0.04627587504999362
"Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors Project Summary The overall goal of this project is to develop a new diagnostic tool, called Cyst-X, for accurate detection and characterization of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts and improve patient outcome through precise decisions (surgical resection or surveillance). Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal cancer among all cancers due to its poor prognosis and lack of early detection methods. Unlike other common cancers where precursor lesions are well known (colon polyps-colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors (cysts) are poorly understood. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages may decrease mortality and morbidity rates of this lethal disease. One major approach for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages is to target pancreatic precancerous pancreatic neoplasms (cysts) before they turn into invasive cancer. Once cysts are detected with radiology imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they should be characterized with respect to their malignant potential. Low-risk cysts remain harmless; hence, patients should remain under surveillance program. On the other hand, high-risk cysts can progress into an aggressive cancer, therefore, patients should undergo surgical resection if possible. Despite this, international guidelines for risk stratification of pancreatic cysts are woefully deficient (55-76% accuracy for determining characteristics of low-risk vs high risk cystic tumors, while only 40-50% accuracy detecting cysts with MRI). Combined, these critical barriers indicate that there is an urgent need for improving characterization of pancreatic cystic tumors. Based on our preliminary results, which support the development of an image-based diagnostic decision tool, we hypothesize that our proposed Cyst-X will produce higher diagnostic accuracy for characterizing pancreatic cysts and provide better patient management compared to the current guidelines. Towards this overarching hypothesis, we will first use powerful deep learning methods (specifically deep capsule networks) for automatically detecting and segmenting the pancreas and pancreatic cysts from multi-sequence MRI scans (Aim 1). Next, we will create an interpretable image-based diagnosis model for characterizing pancreatic cysts (Aim 2). Accurate characterization is necessary for such a diagnostic model; however, emphasis will also be placed on interpretability of the machine generated diagnostic model. Visual explanation of the discriminative features will help radiologists obtain higher decision rates in patient management. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed Cyst-X framework in a multi-center study. A total of 1200 multi-sequence MRI scans will be collected from three participating clinical centers (Mayo Clinic, Columbia University Medical Center, Erasmus Medical Center). Comprehensive evaluations will be made to test the validity and generalizability of Cyst-X. All evaluations will be made with respect to the international guidelines and biopsy proven ground truths. Our proposed study has wide implications: specifically, in the long term, it will influence early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and clinical decision making to improve survival rates of pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Unlike other common cancers for which early detection and surgical resection have reduced cancer deaths (e.g. colon polyps for colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors, such as commonly observed pancreatic cysts, are poorly understood. Towards the long-term goal of early detection of pancreatic cancer, our objective in this proposal is to accurately detect and characterize pancreatic cysts before they turn into aggressive cancer. The outcome of this research will be a new diagnostic tool, named Cyst-X, which will establish a better clinical strategy than the current guidelines by recommending a more selective use of invasive testing, surgery, and surveillance.",Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors,9866770,R01CA246704,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Cyst', 'Cystic Neoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial cyst', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'In Situ Lesion', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucinous Cystadenoma', 'Mucinous Neoplasm', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Names', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatectomy', 'Pancreatic Cyst', 'Pancreatic cystic neoplasia', 'Papillary', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serous Cystadenoma', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Visual', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer type', 'capsule', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome forecast', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'premalignant', 'prognostic significance', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'screening', 'stem', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R01,2020,510210,-0.005435021925006376
"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,9856147,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data Methods', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'convolutional neural network', 'data exploration', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'large datasets', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neural network', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,309176,0.011864930349052592
"Advancing the Quality of Cancer Care through Behavioral Economics and Implementation Science The grand challenge addressed by the Penn Implementation Science Center in Cancer Control (Penn ISC3) is to apply insights from behavioral economics to accelerate the pace at which evidence-based practices for cancer care are deployed to improve outcomes for individuals with cancer. Penn offers a unique environment in which to conduct this paradigm-shifting work, given our expertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, and innovative cancer care delivery. The complementary and multi-disciplinary expertise of the three MPIs (Bei- das, Bekelman, Schnoll), coupled with existing Penn resources, including the Penn Center for Cancer Care Innovation [PC3I], the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics [CHIBE], and the Penn Imple- mentation Science Center at the Leonard Davis Institute [PISCE@LDI], represent a unique opportunity to ad- vance the quality of cancer care. The Administrative Core, led by Drs. Beidas, Bekelman, and Schnoll, will ensure that the activities of Penn ISC3 are coordinated, synergistic, and congruent with timelines. The Implementation Laboratory, led by Drs. Bekelman and Shulman, represents a diverse ecosystem that includes five hospitals and linked clinical sites, with over 200 oncologists that serve over 15,000 unique new patients annually. Our Research Program, led by Drs. Beidas and Buttenheim, will oversee the development and testing of implementation strat- egies that target patients and clinicians within our Implementation Lab and are centered on the idea of ‘nudging’ for optimal implementation and effectiveness outcomes. The Research Program includes investigators with ex- pertise in implementation science, behavioral economics, cancer care delivery research, healthcare innovation, measurement, and mixed methods. In the first two years, we propose three Signature Pilot Projects and two Methods Projects with a commitment to rapid learning that will allow Penn ISC3 to be optimally nimble. Signature Pilot Project 1 (Jenssen/Leone) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase referral to tobacco cessation programs among cancer patients. Signature Pilot Project 2 (Bekelman/Patel) tests patient- and clinician-directed implementation strategies to increase higher-value bone modifying agents in patients with breast, lung, and prostate cancer. Common methods and measures are linked to allow for pooling of data and to accomplish our objectives of testing multilevel implementation strategies and mechanisms across contexts. Our exploratory and high-reward Signature Pilot Project 3 (Bekelman/Rendle) will test a patient-directed imple- mentation strategy that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to promote oral chemotherapy ad- herence and symptom management. Two methods projects, in support of the Projects, will advance the science of implementation methods. Methods Project 1 will develop a toolkit for the application of rapid cycle approaches (Asch/Buttenheim); Methods Project 2 will use qualitative comparative analysis to characterize multilevel con- textual variation (Barg/Rendle). The Penn ISC3 has the potential to identify novel, disseminable, and scalable ways to advance the quality of cancer care and improve the health outcomes for individuals with cancer.

"Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy PROJECT SUMMARY Avinash D Sahu, Ph.D., is a computational biologist whose overarching career goal is to solve longstanding problems in cancer immunology and translational precision oncology using artificial intelligence (AI) and to devise new therapeutic strategies for late-stage cancer patients. Entitled Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy, the proposed research combines cutting-edge AI technology with Immuno-oncology (IO) to produce a systematic approach to identifying drugs that synergize with immunotherapy, and prioritize them for clinical trials for advanced melanoma, bladder, kidney, and lung cancer. Career development plan: Dr. Sahu is a recipient of the Michelson Prize, and his research mission is to initiate precision immuno-oncology by moving patients away from palliative chemotherapy to more personalized IO treatments. His previous training in AI, statistics, method development, cancer, and translation biology have prepared him to conduct the proposed research. Dr. Sahu has outlined specific training activities to expand his skill set in four areas: 1) cancer immunology, 2) AI, 3) translation research and 4) new immunological assays. This skill set will be necessary to gain research independence. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Sahu mentoring and the advisory team assembles world-leading experts in computational biology, translation and clinical research, AI, statistics, and immunology. Also, Dr. Sahu has developed academic collaborations and industry partners to provide him experimental support for the proposal. Leveraging the state-of-art software and google-cloud infrastructure provided by Cancer Immune Data Commons (CIDC); computational resources from DFCI, Harvard, and Broad Institute; as well as unique access to largest immunotherapy patient data from collaborators, Dr. Sahu is uniquely placed to identify most promising IO drug combinations. Research: There is a lack of a principled approach to identify promising IO drug combinations that has often led to arbitrarily designed IO clinical trials without a sound biological basis. The proposal formulates the first in silico predictor to estimate drug’s immunomodulatory effect and potential to synergize with immunotherapies. Aim 1 builds a novel deep learning predictor —DeepImmune— to predict immunotherapy response from transcriptomes. Aim 2 estimates the immunomodulatory effects of drugs from for its drug-induced transcriptomic changes using DeepImmune. Aim 3 prioritize top predicted immunomodulatory drugs and validate their effect in pre-clinical models. Outcomes/Impact: The successful completion of the proposal will result in a robust predictor to rationally combine cancer therapies with immunotherapy and set the basis for a clinical trial to test the most promising combination therapy. The career development award and mentored research will enable Dr. Sahu to become a leader in the new field of research at the intersection of precision immuno-oncology and AI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Combining immunotherapies with other cancer drugs has emerged as a new hope for late-stage cancer patients, however, the lack of a principled approach to identify such effective combinations often led to poorly designed clinical trials. The proposed research engages state-of-art Artificial Intelligence techniques with drug-induced transcriptomic changes to identify drugs that synergize with immunotherapies and prioritize them for clinical trials. Its application, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will rationalize clinical trials, identify new treatments for advanced cancers, and advance precision immuno-oncology.",Identifying drug synergistic with cancer immunotherapy,9953596,K99CA248953,"['Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aftercare', 'Antibodies', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'BRAF gene', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Commons', 'Development Plans', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Factors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunology', 'Immunology procedure', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Infiltration', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Investigational Drugs', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase I/II Clinical Trial', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prize', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'data access', 'deep learning', 'design', 'immune checkpoint blockers', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'melanoma', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'palliative chemotherapy', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'prototype', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'software infrastructure', 'sound', 'statistics', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor-immune system interactions']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,K99,2020,120038,0.020558721274474844
"HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification ABSTRACT: Roughly 40% of the US population will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime. In a majority of these cases, a definitive cancer diagnosis is only possible via histopathologic confirmation using a tissue slide. Increasingly, these slides are being digitally scanned as high-resolution images for usage in both clinical and research digital pathology (DP) workflows. Our group has been pioneering the use of deep learning (DL), a form of machine learning, for segmentation, detection, and classification of various cancers using digital pathology images. DL learns features and their associated weighting from large datasets to maximally discriminate between user labeled data (e.g., cancer vs non-cancer, nuclei vs non-nuclei); a paradigm known as “learn from data”. Unfortunately, this paradigm makes DL especially sensitive to low quality slides, noise induced by small errors in the manual user labeling process, and general dataset heterogeneity. As many groups do not intentionally account for these problems, they learn that successful employment of DL technologies relies heavily on explicitly addressing challenges associated with (a) carefully curating high quality slides without preparation or scanning artifacts, (b) obtaining a large precise collection of annotations delineating objects of interest, and (c) selecting diverse datasets to ensure robust classifier performance when clinically deploying the model. To address these challenges we propose HistoTools, a suite of three modules or “Apps”: (1) HistoQC examines slides for artifacts and computes metrics associated with slide presentation characteristics (e.g., stain intensity, compression levels) helping to quantify ranges of acceptable characteristics for downstream algorithmic evaluation. (2) HistoAnno drastically improves the efficiency of annotation efforts using a combined active learning and deep learning approach to ensure experts focus only on regions which are important for classifier improvement. (3) HistoFinder aids in selecting suitable training and test cohorts to guarantee that various tissue level characteristics are well balanced, leading to increased reproducibility. Our team already has working prototypes of HistoQC (100% concordance with a pathologist, evaluated on n>1200 slides) and HistoAnno (30% efficiency improvement during annotation tasks). In this U01, we seek to further develop and evaluate HistoTools in the context of enhancing two companion diagnostic (CDx) assays being developed in our group. First, we will use HistoTools to quality control and annotate nuclei, tubules, and mitosis for improving our CDx classifier for predicting recurrence in breast cancers using a cohort of n>900 patients from completed trial ECOG 2197. Secondly, HistoTools will be employed for quality control and identification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer nuclei towards improving our CDx classifier for predicting response to immunotherapy in lung cancer using the n>700 patients from completed clinical trials Checkmate 017 and 057. These tools will build on our existing open source tool repository to aid in real-time feedback and dissemination throughout the ITCR and cancer research community. RELEVANCE: This project will result in development of HistoTools, a new digital pathology toolkit for common pre-experiment machine learning tasks in the oncology domain such as (a) timely identification of poor quality slides and slide regions, (b) quantitative metrics driving optimized cohort selection, and (c) generation of highly precise and relevant annotations. Each component is designed to directly combat an existing bottleneck in the evolving usage of digital pathology. HistoTools will significantly enhance the functionality of existing toolboxes and pipelines, facilitating increasingly sophisticated machine learning applications in oncology.","HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification",9897498,U01CA239055,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'International', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nivolumab', 'Noise', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nuclear', 'Oncology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer recurrence', 'cohort', 'combat', 'companion diagnostics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'experimental study', 'heterogenous data', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,381138,0.021054604292226935
"NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration The Department of Energy (DOE)-National Cancer Institute (NCI) Collaboration was formed to jointly accelerate federal missions in precision oncology and computing through an alignment of needs and has been driven by three key national initiatives: the National Strategic Computing Initiative, the Precision Medicine Initiative, and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot. NCI has a critical need for increased computational capacity and sophisticated computational models to identify promising new treatments; deepen understanding of cancer biology; understand the impact of new diagnostics, treatments, and patient factors in cancer outcomes at the individual patient level; and to integrate pre-clinical model data for cancer research, diagnosis and treatment.  DOE has a need for partnerships with user communities to broaden the functionality of next-generation high-performance computers and to advance the DOE mission in low dose radiation and systems biology for energy applications. The DOE-NCI Collaboration brings together the High Performance Computing (HPC) expertise and resources of the DOE with the NCI cancer biology and oncology knowledge base, infrastructure and data repositories to support accelerating capable exascale computing technologies and advance the frontiers of precision oncology, computational and data science, and advanced computing applied to cancer. Initial collaborations between the NCI and DOE were fueled by the National Strategic Computing Initiative (NSCI) 2015 executive order, which promotes a whole-of-government approach to bringing the unique national computing capabilities of lead agencies to transform broad deployment agency missions while meeting their own mission objectives. The DOE, a lead agency for NSCI, partnered with NCI, a broad deployment agency for NSCI, to develop exascale ready tools, algorithms, and capabilities to enhance precision medicine for cancer; this further aligns the DOE-NCI Collaboration initiated under NSCI with the Precision Medicine Initiative and the Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot.   Collaborative projects already underway between the DOE-NCI include the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C) pilot projects, Exascale CANcer Distributed Learning Environment (CANDLE), and the Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities in Medicine (ATOM) Consortium, a public-private partnership under the Cancer Moonshot aimed at changing drug discovery and design paradigms through the application of computational/in silico technologies.  The challenges within each JDACS4C pilot were used to shape the priorities for CANDLE, a DOE-supported Exascale Computing Project involving multiple HPC vendors, which addresses a shared need across the pilots to develop predictive models using large-scale data. Exploiting exascale technologies and capabilities anticipated for deep and machine learning, CANDLE will deliver an open source, collaboratively developed software platform providing deep learning methodologies to the community that will be used to advance precision oncology. In addition, it will establish a new paradigm for cancer research for years to come by making effective use of the ever-growing volumes and diversity of cancer-related data to build predictive models, provide better understanding of the biology underlying disease and, ultimately, provide guidance and support decisions on anticipated outcomes of treatment for individual patients. n/a",NCI Moonshot: NCI-DOE Collaboration,10216917,5N91019D00024,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Models', 'Contractor', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Goals', 'Government', 'High Performance Computing', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Radiobiology', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vendor', 'anticancer research', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'educational atmosphere', 'experience', 'frontier', 'high end computer', 'in silico', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'large scale data', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'public-private partnership', 'repository', 'screening', 'software development', 'tool']",NCI,"LEIDOS BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH, INC.",N01,2020,4506756,0.06742034662265196
"PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Title: PRedictiOn algorithms for the deTECTion of early stage pancreatic cancer (PRO-TECT) Project Summary Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. A major reason for the lethal nature of this disease is the lack of effective strategies for early detection. As a result, the vast majority of cancers are detected at a very late stage. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer could be due to many reasons including, 1) lack of a clear quantitative or algorithm-based definition of a high-risk population who would benefit from active surveillance, 2) suboptimal use of image findings that could potentially foretell a growing tumor, 3) system or referral-related delay from time of abnormal finding to diagnosis and treatment. Methods to accelerate the detection of pancreatic cancer leading to increased proportion of early stage tumors at the time of diagnosis have the potential to have an immediate impact on survival. The objective of the proposed work is to establish a platform for development and implementation of a data-driven approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer within an integrated care setting. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on development of empiric algorithms for prediction of early stage pancreatic cancer as well as systematic pancreatic cancer-risk stratification of patients based on natural language processing-aided extraction of pancreatic features from existing pre-diagnostic imaging reports to enhance understanding of the natural history of disease progression. Finally, we will conduct a prospective cohort study to assess the accuracy of an algorithm-based approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Pancreatic cancer is most often diagnosed in a late, incurable stage. Population-based screening is not effective based on the relatively low incidence of this disease. The current study seeks to develop and apply an alternative approach to enhance our ability to identify patients with early stage pancreatic cancer through use of an electronic ‘trigger’ system based on information gathered from large electronic health systems.",PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT),9948598,R01CA230442,"['Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health Information System', 'Health system', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratory Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pancreas', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'disease natural history', 'electronic data', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk population', 'patient stratification', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'repository', 'screening', 'tumor']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,797939,0.046694002412321065
"Using Electronic Health Records from a Large Clinical Data Research Network to Understand Cancer Burden and Cancer Risks Among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) Individuals ABSTRACT Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people face a disproportionate burden of adverse health outcomes. Although there is a growing body of literature on the unique health issues among TGNC populations, they remain severely underserved as existing data on TGNC health are scarce. Under-reporting is common due to issues related to social and economic marginalization, stigma, and discrimination, leading to challenges in obtaining population-based estimates since TGNC individuals are often unwilling to self-identify and reluctant to participate in traditional surveys. Further, past TGNC research has primarily focused on mental health, substance use and abuse, and sexual transmitted infections and diseases. There is limited data available on age-related chronic conditions such as cancer, the second leading cause of death in the United States. Nonetheless, cancer is one of the top research priorities among the TGNC population. With a rapidly growing aging TGNC population, there is an urgent need to characterize the cancer burden among these individuals and understand how cancer impact them differentially compared to non-TGNC individuals. On the other hand, rapid adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems has made longitudinal clinical data available for research. EHRs contain not only important structured data, such as demographics, diagnoses, procedures, and medications, but also unstructured clinical narratives such as physician’s notes. More than 80 percent of the clinical information is documented in clinical narratives, which contain more detailed patient information including gender identity and cancer risk factors. Motivated by these observations and built upon our previous studies on 1) the adequacy of TGNC gender identity terms, 2) clinical natural language processing methods for information extraction, and 3) EHR-based cohort studies, we propose to conduct a population-based cohort analysis to examine the cancer burden and risk factors among TGNC people using a unique data source from a large network of EHRs—OneFlorida, one of the 13 PCORI-funded clinical data research networks (CDRNs) contributing to the PCORnet. Using both structured and unstructured OneFlorida data, we will first develop computable phenotypes to identify TGNC individuals and subsequently evaluate their cancer risk. Our research is significant because: 1) no population-based cohort studies on cancer risk have been conducted among the TGNC population. Our results will support the development of tailored, evidence- based cancer screening programs for TGNC people; 2) our research will create a cohort of TGNC people that can be not only tracked longitudinally in EHR but also recruited for future clinical studies; and 3) working with a PCORnet CDRN makes our analysis framework generalizable to the overall PCORNet. Overall, the proposed research will advance our knowledge in cancer among the aging TGNC population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project will fill an important gap in our knowledge of cancer burden and risk factors in transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people, a sexual and gender minority (SGM) group. A computable phenotype that can accurately identify TGNC cohorts in large networks of electronic health records (EHRs) enables us to monitor TGNC health longitudinally, which is significant for aging-related diseases such as cancer. Built upon this work, our future work can focus on building informatics tools to support the long-term surveillance and health monitoring of SGMs using large-scale national networks of EHRs.",Using Electronic Health Records from a Large Clinical Data Research Network to Understand Cancer Burden and Cancer Risks Among Transgender and Gender Nonconforming (TGNC) Individuals,10056679,R21CA245858,"['Adoption', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Behavioral', 'Cancer Burden', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Coin', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Face', 'Florida', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gender Identity', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hormone use', 'Hospitals', 'Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Logistic Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening for cancer', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexual and Gender Minorities', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging population', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer statistics', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'evidence base', 'gender nonconforming', 'health care service organization', 'health service use', 'high risk', 'informatics tool', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplasm registry', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'population based', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening program', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'social stigma', 'stem', 'structured data', 'study population', 'transgender']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R21,2020,392115,0.030204967232966402
"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, the outcomes of this project can potentially reduce screening time and costs, eliminate undue stress to patients, increase the coverage and accuracy of screening programs, and overall reduce colorectal cancer mortality.",Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records,9869938,R01LM012837,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Polyps', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive load', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'histopathological examination', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient health information', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'translational impact', 'tv watching', 'whole slide imaging']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,356700,0.039965283694133276
"Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells Project Summary/Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical success treating late-stage tumors, yet the response rates remain low and the side effects are often severe. Designing effective immunotherapies relies on accurate identification of tumor-reactive T cells. This is an extremely difficult task because 1) most of the cancer antigens are unknown; 2) the majority of the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) does not recognize cancer cells; and 3) without known antigens, the only approach to acquire such T cells is to perform ex vivo expansion of TILs stimulated by autologous cancer cells, which generates non-specific T cells and is infeasible to many patients. Nonetheless, this strategy is widely adopted in current clinical trials for anti-cancer treatment, despite its reduced therapeutic efficacy and unpredictable side effects of autoimmunity. Therefore, unbiased, antigen- independent identification of tumor-reactive T cells, if possible, will be a major clinical priority as it will significantly increase the efficiency and safety of T cell based immunotherapies. Here we propose to achieve this goal through the development of novel machine learning methods. Such approach has not yet been explored because the fundamental difference between cancer and non-cancer T cells lies in their receptor sequences (TCR), and training data of cancer-specific TCRs is currently unavailable. To prepare for this task, we have developed the software TRUST, to extract the T cell antigen-binding CDR3 regions from bulk tumor RNA-seq data, and the software iSMART to group these CDR3s into antigen-specific clusters. These tools allowed us to develop a new rationale for producing large training sets of tumor-reactive TCRs, even without knowing cancer antigens. In our preliminary analysis, we observed that TCRs from the training data can be matched to tumor antigens that bind to HLA-A*02:01 and elicit immune response in vivo. The cancer-specific CDR3 amino acid sequences also show significantly different biochemical features from non-cancer ones, based on which we further developed software DeepCAT to demonstrate the feasibility of de novo prediction of cancer TCRs. These exciting results highlighted the importance to develop better computational method to track the tumor-reactive T cells for clinical applications. Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will deliver a new machine learning method for accurate classification of tumor-reactive T cells using the CDR3 sequences. In Aim 2, we will derive a set of biomarkers for the cancer-specific T cells for fast and accurate flow sorting of these T cells from TILs. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell sequencing and functional validation of cancer-specific T cells using humanized animal model to validate the predicted genes, and to produce a prioritized list of promising targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy development. These Aims will be accomplished with the great support from the excellent collaborators specialized in cancer immunology at UTSW. Successful completion of this proposal will provide an exciting new paradigm to identify tumor-reactive T cells for precision cancer immunotherapies. Project Narrative Identification of tumor-specific T cells is critical to immunotherapy development, yet remains a challenging task. In this project we will develop a novel machine learning method to study: 1) which T cells in the tumor microenvironment are reactive to malignant cells; 2) what signature genes can be used to track the cancer- specific T cells.

"Childhood Cancer Data Initiative National Childhood Cancer Registry Development and Refinement of Algorithm Tools  The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) 2019 symposium hosted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) identified “a critical need to collect, analyze, and share data to address the burden of cancer in children, adolescents and young adults”. Currently, cancer registries in the U.S. hold structured information on every cancer case, including pediatric cancers, within their respective catchment areas. For childhood cancer patients and survivors, issues of late effects, recurrence, subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN), and follow-up are critically important to consider and further study. It is also important to address survivors’ life trajectories, which often include moving to different states and away from where their data was initially collected.   The aim of the National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR) is to build a connected data infrastructure that includes longitudinal data from multiple sources and enables secure sharing of childhood cancer data with vetted research investigators. These efforts will support childhood cancer research and provide a population-level dataset on all childhood cancer patients. As a base for the infrastructure, data currently collected at targeted cancer registries, including those in the Surveillance Epidemiology & End Results (SEER) program, will be used to aggregate key information on childhood cancer patients and survivors. In addition to registry data, NCCR aims to incorporate unique data sources including the National Death Index (NDI), State vital records, LexisNexis (residential history and social determinants of health data), and Virtual Pooled Registry (VPR) data on subsequent primaries, as well as pharmacy and radiation oncology data. Additional categories of information that may be integrated into the database include detailed diagnostic characterization of the tumor, treatment information, indicators of tumor recurrence, identification of multiple primary cancers, and genomic characterization of initial and potentially recurrent disease.   The Department of Energy (DOE)/Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is the largest multipurpose science laboratory in the DOE national laboratory system. The mission of ORNL is to deliver scientific discoveries and technical breakthroughs that will accelerate the development and deployment of solutions to meet pressing global challenges aligned with the DOE’s goals. This “science-to-solutions” mission depends on the integration and application of distinctive capabilities in basic and applied research, which include leadership positions and capabilities in high-performance computing (HPC), advanced visualization and data fusion, and computational science and systems engineering and integration. ORNL is recognized as a leader in the research and development of health and data sciences. In the DOE national laboratory system, ORNL has a highly capable and proven data and computing enclave certified to host and analyze protected health information (PHI). ORNL’s capabilities, certified systems that accommodate PHI, HPC capabilities and facilities, and the technical expertise that has proven successful in a recent multi-year project with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Department of Veteran’s Affairs (VA) and its broader engagement with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), are unmatched in the domestic private sector, making ORNL uniquely qualified to perform the work required for this effort.    With growing complexity of cancer diagnosis and treatment, the national cancer surveillance program faces increasing challenges in capturing essential information needed to better understand the effectiveness of cancer treatments in the context of our complex medical and social environment. The capacity to collect automatically and comprehensively information about cancer patients would enhance the ability of cancer registry data to support a broad variety of cancer research and would provide an infrastructure that would permit evaluation of the generalizability of cancer diagnostics and therapies outside the clinical trials setting to the 97%  of the general population not covered by clinical trials. These advances will be important in future healthcare applications beyond cancer, and the knowledge gained will be directly related to technology for future HPC architectures and for making HPC more available to biomedical research.  The Current DOE collaboration with NIH/NCI, known as the Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer, has produced several useful tools and documentation which have been utilized by the cancer surveillance community for adult cancer populations. In particular, ORNL has developed deep learning models and modalities of data analytics that are of particular interest to the NCCR. Their expertise and development of various tools using information from multiple data sources can be used to support various data queries, provide assessment of feasibility of developing trials, and enabling comparisons of key characteristics among the entire population of childhood cancer patients at a population level to compare to patients enrolled in clinical trials (e.g. Children’s Oncology Group [COG]). Furthermore, their expertise and computing capabilities will enable NCI to refine and develop scaling mechanisms of existing data extraction algorithms to obtain data from text documentation in pediatric cancer abstracts that would otherwise be difficult to obtain.    This infrastructure will serve as the central data index and warehouse for childhood cancer data through large-scale data identification and linkages and has the potential to provide real-world evidence to support data-driven clinical guidelines. These developed tools combined with this data infrastructure will also support a broad range of research questions. Through the shared follow-up information across registries and other data linkage sources, annual follow-up data will be greatly enhanced for childhood cancer survivors and pediatric oncology research.  The purpose of this agreement is to provide funding to 1) support the development and refinement of advanced computational tools (e.g., artificial intelligence, knowledge graph, graph analytics, text extraction algorithms, predictive modeling, and other advanced computational methodologies) using key data from the NCCR infrastructure and various other external data sources, and 2) utilize NCCR to further refine existing tools developed by DOE/ORNL. n/a",Childhood Cancer Data Initiative National Childhood Cancer Registry Development and Refinement of Algorithm Tools ,10281416,PC20005001,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Catchment Area', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Infrastructure', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Late Effects', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Private Sector', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SEER Program', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'computerized tools', 'data fusion', 'data infrastructure', 'data registry', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'indexing', 'interest', 'knowledge graph', 'large scale data', 'multiple data sources', 'neoplasm registry', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'social health determinants', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE,Y01,2020,1000000,0.07566970224400663
"A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer Project Summary We seek to develop robust platforms for capturing, enumerating and analyzing circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells from the blood of cancer patients. We will leverage our previously developed precisely engineered microfilter platform that allows effective separation and collection of viable CTC from patient blood. In parallel, we have developed novel imaging methods perfectly suited for rapid analyses for circulating tumor cells, clusters and associated cancer cell subtypes (such as Cancer Associated Fibroblasts, or CAF). We propose to integrate these two novel technologies to create a robust diagnostic tool for clinical pathology as well as basic research that enables capture, enumeration, and analyses of circulating tumor cells and associated cancer cells. Our multidisciplinary team proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Build and validate the technology to rapidly acquire CTC/CAF images using Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy and evaluate the images with a deep learning algorithm  2) Evaluation of the integrated platform for using CTC/CAF in predicting recurrence/survival in early stage  breast cancer patients For these studies in early stage breast cancer, we have robust collaborations with industry partners in Circulogix Inc (Microfilter technology for cell capture), ClearBridge Inc. (FPM imaging of the microfilter surface), and Google Software (Deep learning algorithm for analyzing FPM images of microfilter). The ability to reliably and rapidly detect and analyze CTC and associated cancer cells in early stage breast cancer patients would deliver a major new tool for oncology research, a platform for screening of novel drugs, and a critical advance in precision cancer management. Project Narrative (Relevance) Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) and circulating Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (cCAF) are the agents of spread of cancer (metastasis), which is a direct cause of a large number of cancer-related deaths. Our interdisciplinary team of pathologists, engineers, cancer cell biologists, and microscopists along with industry partners will combine their novel technologies to, for the first time, establish robust capture, rapid identification and enumeration of CTC, cCAF and their clusters from whole blood of early stage breast cancer patients. If successful, our approach would enable researchers to better diagnose metastasis, predict risk of recurrence, and help clinicians to employ personalized therapy through treatment plans tailored to suit individual patients, hence resulting in a significant impact on human health.",A comprehensive liquid biopsy platform for detection and prognostication in early stage breast cancer,10001470,U01CA233363,"['Address', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Competence', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fluorescence', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Minnesota', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Surface', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Whole Blood', 'analytical tool', 'arm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer cell subtype', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'expectation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'industry partner', 'liquid biopsy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic index', 'prognostic tool', 'response', 'screening', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2020,422658,-0.05234480705465865
"Determinants of pancreatic cancer and malignant melanoma phenotypes in CDKN2A hereditary kindreds This proposal addresses Provocative Question #2. We will use innovative approaches to investigate how CDKN2A (which encodes p16) mutation carriers develop different cancer phenotypes (pancreatic cancer vs melanoma vs no cancer), and include both genetic and non-genetic factors. We have identified 4 large, multi- generational kindreds with a founder CDKN2A deleterious mutation (L16R, 47T>G). Our preliminary observations demonstrate that this mutant has lower expression and decreased ability to regulate cell cycle progression compared to wild type protein. Our sequencing studies of kindred members with different cancer phenotypes have identified potential variants in novel genes that modify risk (LGR6, a co-receptor of Wnt signaling and COL11A1, which participates in oncogenic signaling, including TGFbeta). We will determine the ability of the p16 mutant to promote transformation and how it is influenced by interaction with the above candidate modifier genes, LGR6 or COL11A1, in pancreatic cancer and melanoma. We will also develop novel computational models using machine deep learning, to generate networks that capture high dimensional features to integrate gene, biology, and cancer phenotype. This approach will be extended to kindreds with other CDKN2A mutations. Our Specific Aims are to: (1) Identify genotypes of potential modifier genes in multiple kindreds that feature pancreatic cancer and melanoma and known to carry CDKN2A germline mutations. We will use genome wide variant coverage of germline DNA from CDKN2A carriers from the 4 large L16R kindreds, plus additional members in 42 other similar CDKN2A kindreds. We will identify candidate modifier genes in the kindreds by rule-based statistical genetic analysis of genotypes. (2) Define the impact of CDKN2A L16R mutation on the function of p16 and its interplay with candidate modifier genes. We will elucidate the biological significance of mutations in CDKN2A and candidate modifier genes using functional and high throughput methodologies by analyzing the mechanism underlying the interplay between p16 and modifier genes; define new pathways cooperating with this interplay using a combination of genome wide studies to assess transformation in cells carrying p16 mutant or wild-type background using well established in vitro and in vivo models. (3) Develop a deep learning network model to integrate genetic, biological and epidemiological data to accurately infer pancreatic cancer and melanoma phenotypes and age of onset in mutation carriers. We will apply a convolutional neural network, a deep learning algorithm in the training dataset, develop a back-propagation algorithm to fine tune “weights,” and construct mutation-gene networks to capture high-dimensional features for each disease subclass. We will acquire and disseminate new knowledge and tools to the scientific community. Our integrated methods and approach will bring insight into how different cancer phenotypes can occur with identical predisposing mutations, which can be applied to other cancer syndromes with similar challenges.

"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9841402,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiscale data', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,188952,0.04765487375809762
"Functional Cancer Cell Maps FUNCTIONAL CANCER CELL MAPS SUMMARY I am currently an Academic Program Officer in Prof. Trey Ideker’s lab at UC San Diego. My title reflects the varied roles I play in the Ideker Lab, both scientifically and administratively, as I also serve as the Assistant Director of the Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI) and the San Diego Center for Systems Biology (SDCSB). I am involved in a wide range of research projects, both within the Ideker Lab and across the various Centers. Central though to many of these efforts is the role I play supervising a number of projects using the CRISPR/Cas9­based approach to map genetic interactions in cancer cells. These functional maps can be used to identify protein complexes and pathways in cancer cells and to reveal genetic dependencies that might be therapeutically tractable. These studies will also provide us with the necessary training data to build “visible” AIs, machine learning models that not only make accurate predictions but also provide mechanistic insights. FUNCTIONAL CANCER CELL MAPS NARRATIVE Many cancers in adults are caused by mutations acquired over time. Research in both the Ideker Lab and the Cancer Cell Map Initiative seek to understand how these mutations alter the function of proteins leading to cancer using a variety of biochemical, genetic and computational approaches.

"Standardized and Genome-Wide Clinical Interpretation of Complex Genotypes for Cancer Precision Medicine Project Summary Clinical interpretation of genomic variants in childhood cancers is heavily reliant upon our ability to precisely locate and apply structured biomedical knowledge. This exercise is uniquely challenging for pediatric cancers. Even compared to other cancers, childhood cancers are highly heterogeneous, often involving genes not typically attributed to adult cancers and often involving complex, large-scale variations. Childhood cancers also tend to arise in less differentiated cell lineages, progress rapidly, and have much lower incidence and mutation burden. These characteristics are compounded by unique clinical challenges related to developmental factors and treatment-related secondary cancers, resulting in significantly fewer targeted therapy options available to pediatric patients. These challenges have led to a significant under-representation of genes and variants relevant to childhood cancers in public cancer databases and knowledgebases. Thus, there is a critical unmet need for structured genetic variant level data in publicly accessible databases which document diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers for childhood cancers. The Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) focuses on accelerating research on childhood cancers by developing and enhancing tools and methods to extract knowledge and enable sharing of childhood cancer data. The CIViC resource is a knowledge extraction and data sharing platform for clinical interpretation of cancer variants. Expert curators extract knowledge and evidence from the literature to produce rigorous and high-quality assertions following widely-recognized clinical variant classification guidelines. The variant classifications are made freely available in the public domain and are widely utilized in clinical workflows. However, to date, CIViC knowledge curation has focused almost entirely on adult malignancies. Other key variant knowledgebases either do not provide clinical relevance, lack childhood-specific interpretations, and/or have restrictive licenses. We propose to close this knowledge gap in CIViC by forging new and expanded collaboration with pediatric cancer experts, and building domain-specific tools for curation and dissemination of high-quality variant interpretations for childhood cancers. The CIViC visual interface will be adapted to better support curation and dissemination of childhood cancer variants interpretations. A modification of our existing natural language processing approach will be used to prioritize literature relevant to childhood cancers and an expert panel will prioritize childhood variants and subsequently perform and also evaluate curation on taskforce calls. Based on the experience and products of this work, we will develop childhood-cancer-specific curation guidelines and conduct pilot development of a childhood cancer variant panel that is capable of evolving rapidly as childhood cancer variant knowledge accumulates in CIViC. Project Narrative Childhood cancers present many unique challenges for interpreting the clinical relevance of genetic variations found in each patient. For this reason, genes and variants associated with childhood tumors are significantly under-represented in public cancer databases and knowledgebases. Building on the success of CIViC (www.civicdb.org), a widely adopted resource for interpretation of adult cancer variants, we will create a free, publicly accessible companion resource of expert curated diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers for childhood cancers.",Standardized and Genome-Wide Clinical Interpretation of Complex Genotypes for Cancer Precision Medicine,10228464,U24CA237719,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Lineage', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Exercise', 'Future', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Structures', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Incidence', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Literature', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Peer Review', 'Prognostic Marker', 'PubMed', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'data sharing', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experience', 'forging', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge curation', 'member', 'pediatric patients', 'precision oncology', 'prognostic', 'sharing platform', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'tool']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U24,2020,157500,0.03304929661772882
"Proteogenomic Data Analysis for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation PROJECT SUMMARY It has become feasible to generate deep quantitative data for many of the molecules that are functional in cells, making it possible to survey a large number of tumors measuring genomic alterations and changes to transcripts, proteins and metabolites. It is, however, not clear what is the best way to integrate these data sets to extract as much information as possible about the biology that drives the cancer and how to best disrupt the tumor growth. Our proposed Proteogenomic Data Analysis Center for Cancer Systems Biology and Clinical Translation will develop new methods for better analyzing and integrating these data sets. In addition to developing statistical and machine learning methods, we also emphasize visual exploration of the data, and we will implement interactive web browser based visualization that will allow researchers to easily explore these vast data sets and gain novel insights by being able to quickly switch between summary information and details of the raw data. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the proposed data analysis center is to leverage high dimensional large-scale data from tumor samples to identify new avenues for the development of clinical prognostics and therapeutics for cancer.

"SimBioSys PhenoScope: A Cloud-Enabled, Web-Based Portal for Raw and Processed Cancer Phenotype Data Spanning Scales from Genomes to Tissues While genomic methods yield a plethora of information on the underlying cause and variety of cancers, genotype is only one factor contributing to the observed phenotype of a tumor. Heterogeneity among cancers and differences within individual tumors continue to challenge the efforts to develop effective therapies. A multitude of data such as single cell sequencing, digital pathology, and medical imaging are being generated that captures heterogeneity across multiple scales. However, data is siloed and connections between scales remains elusive. We propose the development of SimBioSys PhenoScope, a novel research tool to harmonize these disparate data types and provide connections between the genomic, cellular/pathway, microscopic tissue environment, and tissue scales. Combining state-of-the art machine learning, dimensionality reduction techniques, novel spatio-temporal simulation algorithms, and support for public data repositories, PhenoScope will provide a new means of assessing factors contributing to a cancer's phenotypical behavior. As an exploratory data platform, the tool will provide novel multi-scale visualizations by relying on the novel analyses between scales, that could be used by academic and pharmaceutical researchers alike to generate hypotheses for new drug targets, dosing regimens, and research targets.

"Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic origin (PATCH Center) SUMMARY-ABSTRACT  The overall goal of this proposal is to construct two pre-cancer atlases (PCAs) from highly accessible pre- malignant diseases that impose high burdens on human health (i) one focused on progression of pre- melanoma lesions to invasive cancer and (ii) a second on progression from clonal hematopoiesis (CHIP) to myeloid neoplasms. Both of these involve expansion of specific clones in normal and diseased niches as shaped by complex interactions among immune and pre-cancer cells. The resulting Atlases developed by the Center for Pre-cancer Atlases of Cutaneous and Hematologic Origin (PATCH Center) present complementary technical challenges, avenues to scientific discovery, and opportunities for the development of precision prevention strategies and therapies. The key goal in both cases is to precisely delineate and understand the molecular mechanisms driving progression from pre-malignant to malignant disease, to identify high risk individuals, prioritize particular therapies and serve as the foundation for precision prevention clinical trials. This will be achieved by integrated characterization of single cell genotype and cell states using high-plex tissue imaging and omic characterization of cross-sectional and well-controlled longitudinal patient cohorts.  Aim 1 will establish an administrative core responsible for scientific management of the Center, coordination with HTAN members and dissemination of Atlases under the direction of an internal Executive Committee with three subcommittees. Aim 2 will establish a Biospecimen Unit under the leadership of pathologists, oncologists and a surgeon. The DFCI Pasquarello Tissue Repository will provide highly annotated hematological specimens for image-based and omic characterization of CHIP; the BWH dermatopathologic tissue repository will provide annotated FFPE samples for melanoma precursors. These services will also play a key role in prospective sample acquisition and analysis. Aim 3 will establish a Characterization Unit directed by an oncologist and pathologist to perform and integrate single-cell genomics, multiplex flow cytometry and high- plex imaging using two methods reduced to practice within the Center: tissue-based cyclic immunofluorescence (t-CyCIF) and DNA exchange imaging (DEI). The Characterization Unit will also validate reagents and associate all primary results with appropriate metadata, protocols and reagent specifications. Aim 4 will establish a Data Analysis Unit enlisting systems and computational biologists and data scientists to manage all aspects of data acquisition, interpretation and visualization. This is expected to be the most technically challenging aspect of the Atlas projects. The Data Analysis Unit will release Phase I/II atlases each in preliminary and final stages to facilitate collaborative and crowd-sourced approaches to algorithm development. The resulting human browsable and machine-readable atlases are expected to yield new scientific discoveries, demonstrate the feasibility and utility of new technologies and help to reduce the incidence of life-threatening cancers of the skin and blood. NARRATIVE Construction of Pre-Cancer Atlases comprising detailed spatial and molecular data on cell state and omic data in melanoma and clonal hematopoiesis will join together the two primary means of diagnosing human cancer: histology and genetics.

"A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research Project Summary Cancer research is now a data-driven discipline, but only a minority of cancer researchers are data scientists. This severely restricts our ability to effectively study and cure the disease. The far reaching significance of our project is in federating disparate data and computational resources in order to provide a unifying analysis platform for computational cancer research.  We will extend the popular scientific workbench Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org) so that it can integrate with distributed data and compute resources used and needed by cancer researchers, including those resources in the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons (NCR DC). Our Federated Galaxy system will allow users to seamlessly access NCR DC data across multiple resources. It will support multiple analysis scenarios tuned to skills and computational requirements of individual researchers.  The aims of this project are: Aim 1. Extend Galaxy for working with distributed cancer genomics and phenotypic data. This will enable Galaxy users to access both public and private cancer data regardless of their actual physical location. Best-practice approaches will be used for accessing restricted datasets.  Aim 2. Enhance Galaxy for context-aware, distributed cancer genomics analyses using shared workflow representations. This will enable Galaxy users to run genomics analyses on different clouds, ultimately reducing the time, cost, and data transfer associated with analyses.  Aim 3. Apply Federated Galaxy to precision oncology research. Workflows developed in this aim will leverage the technologies in Aims 1 and 2 to benchmark machine learning algorithms for predicting tumor phenotype and drug response. Interactive reports will summarize benchmarking results and utilize ITCR visualizations for deep dives into results.  Our system will provide a singular access point to distributed cancer datasets and will enable these data to be analyzed within a single portal in a way that satisfies multiple analysis scenarios and utilizes diverse computational resources. Finally, a cloud-centric Galaxy built for the NCR DC will substantially grow the community of users working with the GDC and the NCR DC. This is because Galaxy brings with itself a vibrant world-wide community of users and developers, which numbers tens of thousands of scientists. These individuals will help to tune the GDC and other resources within the NCR DC to the needs of real-life analysis scenarios and will enrich the set of tools accessible to cancer researchers. Project Narrative This project will develop a user-friendly scientific analysis workbench for analyzing cancer genomics data on the NCI Cancer Research Data Commons cloud platform. The workbench will democratize access to cloud-based cancer genomic analyses. It will also aid in precision cancer medicine by benchmarking and identifying the most accurate analytic methods for classifying tumors and predicting drug response.",A Federated Galaxy for user-friendly large-scale cancer genomics research,9991807,U24CA231877,"['Awareness', 'Benchmarking', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Communities', 'Community Developments', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Commons', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Galaxy', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Minority', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'anticancer research', 'cancer genomics', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'computational platform', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'data standards', 'design', 'distributed data', 'drug response prediction', 'empowered', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'genomics cloud', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'phenotypic data', 'precision oncology', 'prediction algorithm', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'web interface']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U24,2020,768596,0.09226415509686671
"Identifying optimal dynamic strategies for prostate cancer control PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Big Data has the potential to revolutionize cancer research and care, but extracting the information it holds on the optimal strategies for cancer control will require cutting-edge tools in data science. The optimal strategies for cancer control will be dynamic strategies that adapt clinical decisions over time to a patient’s evolving clinical history. Unfortunately, conventional statistical methods cannot appropriately compare dynamic strategies, so we need methods specifically designed for this task: g-methods. G-methods have helped to shape clinical care in many areas, but they have not been systematically applied to cancer research. Further, while g-methods let us validly estimate the effect of pre-specified strategies, these may not be the optimal strategies. My overarching goal is to apply and further develop analytic methods to learn the optimal strategies for cancer control from complex longitudinal data and generate user-friendly, publicly-available software to make these methods available to the cancer research community. I will apply these methods to answer key clinical questions across the prostate cancer control continuum: 1) the optimal dietary and lifestyle strategies to prevent aggressive prostate cancer, 2) the optimal screening strategy following a baseline PSA test to maximize detection of aggressive disease while minimizing detection of indolent tumors, and 3) the optimal statin therapy strategy to maximize survival among men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. This project will leverage data from a large prospective cohort study and a novel platform of electronic health records linked with genetic data. I will first apply g-methods to estimate the effects of recommended strategies for cancer control that a randomized trial would have limited feasibility to evaluate. I will then investigate whether novel methods that learn the optimal strategies from the data may lead to improved, targeted recommendations that get the right interventions to the right people at the right time. This innovative project will advance comparative effectiveness research for cancer care at the cutting edge of data science. I am optimally positioned to undertake this research based on my 1) expertise in cancer, epidemiology, and causal inference; 2) exceptional multidisciplinary mentoring team comprised of global leaders in their respective fields; and 3) unparalleled research environment to support my career development. Through this work, I will expand my expertise in new areas, including machine learning. The proposed research and training will help me achieve my long-term career goal to become an independent investigator and lead a transdisciplinary research program that integrates causal inference and machine learning to identify optimal strategies for cancer control. Leveraging rich, existing data, this proposal represents a significant opportunity to develop, apply, and disseminate powerful methods for big clinical data to accelerate progress in cancer research and care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will answer key clinical questions about the optimal strategies for prostate cancer prevention, detection, and treatment by applying innovative analytic methods to complex longitudinal data. This research will result in the development, application, and dissemination of powerful methods for big clinical data that accelerate progress in cancer research and care.",Identifying optimal dynamic strategies for prostate cancer control,9944221,K99CA248335,"['Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Control', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Indolent', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nonmetastatic', 'PSA screening', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Screening Result', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal database', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prostate cancer prevention', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2020,128088,-0.027609354173906864
"Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation Project Summary/Abstract Cancer metabolism is a complex network of perturbations to essential chemical and enzymatic reactions; however, the past century has seen a largely reductionist approach to understanding this system. While previously this approach was necessary due to technological limitations, current computer age technological advances allow us to survey, model, and explore the biological details of individual cells and populations of cells. Scientific fields, such as RNA biology and metabolism, have experienced massive strides in recent decades with the advent of RNA-seq and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, yet our ability to contextualize and extract the full extent of these enormous datasets continues to lag and often results in focusing on only a handful of entities from a dataset. This effectively causes “big data” to become “little data”. This is problematic as these experiments are often expensive and time-consuming to produce, yet we only use a fraction of the total data produced by a given experiment. For the F99 phase of my proposal, I will address these limitations by leading the development of Metaboverse, a multi-omic computational analysis framework built upon our previous work to contextualize -omics datasets within customizable and global metabolic network representations. This framework will lay the foundation allowing for the exploration of complex forms of metabolic regulation in cancer. For example, we will analyze the ability of metabolic networks to undergo dispersed and low-magnitude regulation, where, rather than one or two components acting as the core regulatory actors, regulation is performed by dispersed groups of genes, proteins, or metabolites. This framework and related regulatory research will revolutionize our ability to more holistically understand temporal metabolic shifts and gene-metabolite intra-cooperativity, as well as ensure we obtain the maximum amount of information from our data. For the K00 phase of my proposal, I will work with a postdoctoral mentor at an NCI-Designated Cancer Center or affiliated institution that will supplement my training in machine learning and network biology to develop models that improve our ability to predict metabolic state from transcriptomic state. Doing so will allow us to harness the vast transcriptomics databases in cancer biology to better understand the role of metabolism across heterogeneous tumor cell populations. My ultimate goal is to become a tenured professor and run an independent, NIH-funded research lab that focuses on computational cancer metabolism research and that develops methods for interrogating this emerging domain of biology. Project Narrative While cancer metabolism is a robust and well-developed research field, approaches to its holistic understanding are still under-developed and hinder our ability to contextualize these complex metabolic states and their consequences. During the F99 phase, I will develop tools and methods that allow researchers to explore data in a more holistic manner than previously possible, which will be essential to elucidating more complicated regulatory mechanisms within cancer metabolism. During the K00 phase, I will develop novel machine learning algorithms that will improve our ability to predict the metabolic state from the transcriptional state, allowing us to harness the rich transcription datasets found in cancer biology for therapeutic benefit.",Contextualizing Chaotic Metabolic Networks and Their Regulation,10065368,F99CA253744,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Work', 'base', 'chemical reaction', 'computerized tools', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'multiple omics', 'neglect', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'ribosome profiling', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,F99,2020,36742,0.03539820707221309
"Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics PROJECT SUMMARY The proposed research has two broad, long-term objectives. First, it seeks to shift medical practice toward more personalized treatments, by applying innovative methods to analyze and integrate DNA, RNA and protein data generated by a large network of GDAN researchers in a miRNA-centric framework. Analyses will identify cancer subtypes, and individual patients within a subtype, in which alterations in the expression of certain miRNAs influence cancer pathogenesis and drug response. Second, the proposed research seeks to shift cancer genomics research by allowing a diverse group of cancer researchers to flexibly access and use the project’s cancer genomics data, and microRNA-centric results and methods, through a cloud computing framework. The proposed research has three specific aims: 1) Build a computational pipeline for processing and analysis of miRNA data, 2) Elucidate the regulation of and by miRNAs through integrative analysis, and 3) Delineate the role of miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment using predictive modeling. Research design and methods: 1) Processing and analysis of miRNA data. We will process total RNA sequence data to identify expressed miRNAs, and extend the current processing pipeline to identify potentially functional miRNA sequence variants. We will apply our miRNA-centric analyses developed for The Cancer Genome Atlas project to identify: subtypes within a cancer, miRNAs that are associated with survival, miRNA targeting effects on gene and protein expression, and cis-effects of copy number and DNA methylation on miRNA abundances. 2) Regulation of and by miRNAs. Collaborating within the research network, we will extend our analysis methods to take into account additional datatypes and functional contexts that influence how miRNAs are regulated, and how they regulate genes and their products. 3) Predictive modeling. As the research network will have detailed clinical data and multiplatform genomic data, we will apply machine learning algorithms in a novel context to key sets of genes, proteins and miRNAs that predict clinical outcomes like survival and drug response. 4) Cloud computing. We will make our data, analysis methods and results readily available to a broad group of researchers within a cloud computing framework. NARRATIVE MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (~22 nt) RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate levels of gene products, including proteins that are drug targets in cancer. In order to shift medical practice towards personalized treatments, the proposed research will apply innovative analysis methods to understand the role of miRNA expression on survival and drug response, within the context of DNA, RNA and protein data generated in a large research network. This will help identify cancer subtypes, and individual patient phenotypes, in which alterations in miRNA expression can lead to particular cancer progression pathways and treatment responses, in order to inform disease management.",Integrative miRNA data analysis for clinical cancer genomics,10011765,U24CA210952,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Affect', 'Award', 'Biogenesis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Targeting', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Sequences', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Variant', 'analysis pipeline', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'computational pipelines', 'flexibility', 'gene product', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'heterogenous data', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy outcome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tumor progression', 'working group']",NCI,PROVINCIAL HEALTH SERVICES AUTHORITY,U24,2020,398334,0.07327143489661185
"Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research Project Summary / Abstract: Bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, and non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for 75-80% of all cases. Tumor recurrence and progression are common among NMIBC patients: over 50% of patients have their tumors recur, most within the first year, and up to 45% of high-risk tumors progress to muscle-invasive disease within 5 years. Patients therefore undergo intensive clinical surveillance and treatment, contributing to bladder cancer being the most expensive cancer to treat on a per patient basis. Large population-based studies have been limited in their ability to study tumor recurrence and progression because these key outcomes are not typically captured in cancer registry or other discretely coded data. To overcome this limitation and facilitate future epidemiologic and outcomes studies on NMIBC, we propose to develop and validate automated algorithms using natural language processing (NLP) to capture bladder cancer recurrence (Aim 1) and progression (Aim 2) from free-text pathology, urology, and imaging notes. We will externally validate the accuracy of the algorithms for extracting tumor characteristics using a national sample of 575 patients from the Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare system (Aim 3). NLP is a powerful tool that works by segmenting notes into units of related text (e.g., sentences) and applying computational methods to determine meaning and extract data. We will use a novel, internally-developed NLP tool that integrates the best components of several open source NLP packages to efficiently develop, refine, and validate the proposed algorithms. Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) is an ideal study setting because of its large, diverse population, advanced electronic health record, high-quality cancer registry, and complete capture of care. The initial NLP algorithms will be created based on clinical input and chart reviews of a sample of medical records. The algorithms first will be developed using diagnostic reports, leveraging validated cancer registry data on 6,000 patients; the same clinical procedures are used for initial diagnosis as for recurrence / progression. Then, algorithms will be applied to surveillance reports and iteratively refined based on false positive and negative results vs. study chart reviews (n=100 for each iteration). The final algorithms will be compared to an expert reference standard provided by 2 urologic oncologists and a pathologist in a sample of 200 patients. Algorithm performance will be assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. The final algorithms will be applied to 4,000 newly diagnosed NMIBC patients age >18 from 2008-2017 within KPSC. The frequency of recurrence and progression will be described, and characteristics of patients with and without the outcomes will be compared. Successful completion of study aims will produce novel, automated methods that will facilitate large epidemiologic and outcomes studies, whose results may improve care for NMIBC patients. Project Narrative Among non-muscle invasive bladder cancer patients, the key outcomes are tumor recurrence and progression: treatment seeks to reduce recurrence and progression, and surveillance seeks to promptly identify these tumors for treatment. However, these key outcomes are not typically recorded in cancer registry or other discrete data, limiting the ability of large, population-based studies to study them. We therefore propose to develop novel, automated methods to identify bladder cancer recurrence and progression from pathology, urology, and imaging notes to facilitate large, population-based studies of bladder cancer.",Development of an automated method to capture bladder cancer recurrence and progression for epidemiologic research,9850957,R21CA227606,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'California', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Language', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muscle', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Reference Standards', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resort', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'SEER Program', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specialist', 'Text', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Factor', 'United States', 'Urology', 'Veterans', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'algorithm development', 'anticancer research', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer recurrence', 'clinical care', 'data registry', 'discrete data', 'disorder control', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'frailty', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'neoplasm registry', 'non-muscle invasive bladder cancer', 'novel', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'systems research', 'tool', 'treatment trial', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'urologic']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2020,210481,0.051295947524608775
"Comparative Modeling of Effective Policies for Colorectal Cancer Control ABSTRACT Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The long-term goal of our proposed project is to reduce the population burden of CRC by providing the information needed to address key policy questions across the CRC control continuum in an accessible and transparent manner. To accomplish this goal we will use our population-based microsimulation models to: 1) Evaluate the impact of screening as practiced in the US; 2) Inform the debate about the increase in CRC incidence before age 50; 3) Consider the effectiveness of precision of screening and surveillance; 4) Address other emerging issues and opportunities in CRC control; and 5) Use novel methods to improve model accessibility and transparency. Our team will fill critical gaps in knowledge, enabling decision makers to act. New evidence that we will incorporate in our models to better inform CRC control opportunities will be 1) updated information on screening patterns in the US (in collaboration with the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimen, or PROSPR), 2) data on the increased risk of CRC in persons under age 50 (in collaboration with Rebecca Siegal of the American Cancer Society, who did the seminal work in this area), and 3) state-of-the art colonoscopy screening data to incorporate alternative carcinogenesis pathways in the natural history models (in collaboration with the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry). We will synthesize and incorporate the growing body of evidence in the literature to assess the clinical utility of personalized screening and treatment, as well as the potential role for novel computer-aided detection and diagnosis modalities. We will expand our models to project clinical and resource-based outcomes for middle-income countries that are considering the implementation of a screening program. Lastly, there is a critical need to make our models assessible and transparent. To this end we will use high performance computing approaches to develop and apply deep- learning methods for model calibration and model emulation, which will aid in model sharing. The three participating modeling groups are well positioned to carry out this work, bringing a wealth of experience, expertise, and insight to issues related to microsimulation modeling of CRC, and have a proven track record of collaboration and disseminating our work to health policy decision makers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite large increases in screening in the past two decades, colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Our research has shown that 60% of these deaths could be prevented by better use of available screening interventions. In this proposal, we use microsimulation modeling to evaluate and help prioritize interventions to further reduce the burden of colorectal cancer.",Comparative Modeling of Effective Policies for Colorectal Cancer Control,10069899,U01CA253913,"['Address', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'High Performance Computing', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural History', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'comparative', 'computer aided detection', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized screening', 'population based', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening program']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,U01,2020,1252212,0.014489237502767583
"High-Throughput Functional Genomics to Guide Precision Oncology in Gastrointestinal Tumors Abstract:  This is an application for a K22 award for Dr. John Paul Shen, a medical oncologist currently at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Shen is establishing himself as a young translational investigator in the field of cancer genomics. This K22 award will provide Dr. Shen with the resources and training to accomplish the following objectives; (1) implement advanced computational methods on genome scale datasets (2) become an expert in functional genomics, (3) achieve proficiency experimenting in mouse models of cancer, (4) successfully manage an independent laboratory. To achieve these objectives, after accepting a faculty position Dr. Shen will assemble a diverse advisory committee including experts in bioinformatics, experimental cancer biology, and clinical oncology.  It was proposed by many that the ability to sequence a tumor genome, now made possible by next- generation sequencing, would bring about a new era of precision oncology in which chemotherapy choices would be individualized to match a single tumor and patient. However, the use genomic information in clinical practice remains limited by the fact that currently very few mutations are associated with response to a specific drug. This is particularly true in Gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies, where there are few targeted therapy options and few effective biomarkers help guide chemotherapy selection. Dr. Shen seeks to address this pressing need by employing high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.  Recognizing that there will be great heterogeneity from one tumor to the next, even within the same cancer type, the functional genomic data created here will be combined with systems biology methods to identify how the vulnerabilities of each unique tumor can be predicted with information readily available to a clinical oncologist. Using network-based machine learning methods applied to chemo-genomic viability data in molecularly characterize cell lines it is expected that predictive biomarkers will be identified for both novel targeted agents and currently used chemotherapy drugs. This will allow oncologists to design individualized chemotherapy regimens for each patient. Project Narrative  Although the development of targeted anti-cancer therapies has had a major impact on many tumor types, there is currently a lack of effective targeted drugs for patients with cancers of the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This proposal seeks to address this pressing need by using novel high-throughput functional genomic methods to identify tumor specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited therapeutically.

"UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network The “UCSC-Buck Genome Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network” will develop state-of-the-art methods for integrating various types of data to discover the genetic pathways, the microenvironment, the originating cells, and the oncogenic processes driving the initiation and progression of tumors. The long term goals of the project are to identify highly accurate models detailing the faulty genetic circuitry at work in each subclone of a patient’s tumor, as well as any “normal” cells acting as accomplices by supporting the cancer microenvironment. The ultimate objective is to encode computer algorithms that can search a patient’s individual pathway diagram for the best combination of interventions to eliminate every tumor cell, while preserving the health of every normal cell, in their body. Integrative pathway analysis methods will be developed to reveal signatures of tumor subtypes from Pan-Cancer and external datasets. New technologies will be established for uncovering network models tailored to individual patients. The tools will be deployed as part of an active collaboration to support the specific projects of the Genome Data Analysis Network. Novel probabilistic graphical models will be used to infer disrupted signaling. Cellular signatures will be collected from the analysis of normal cells, cancer cell line models, and Pan-Cancer investigations. Novel machine-learning methods, guided by pathway mechanisms, will be established to identify cell state signatures in heterogeneous patient samples. This work will reveal rare mutations driving metastatic transformation that are currently of unknown significance. New clues about the genetic circuitry promoting response and resistance to treatment will be established. Finally, cross-tumor connections that relate tumors of one type to a different type will suggest new avenues for treatment. Computational strategies for interpreting the results of cancer genome sequencing projects are in  desperate need. To select appropriate treatment strategies for a patient, an accurate model of the  altered genetic wiring in the tumor is needed as well as how that wiring relates to other tumors  and to other normal cells at various stages of differentiation. The research will establish  resources and software to contribute such methodologies for the Genome Data Analysis Network  projects that will subsequently be released into the public domain to benefit the entire scientific  community.",UCSC-Buck Specialized Genomic Data Analysis Center for the Genomic Data Analysis Network,10001323,U24CA210990,"['Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cells', 'Cisplatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA copy number', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genome Data Analysis Center', 'Genome Data Analysis Network', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North Carolina', 'Oncogenic', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteomics', 'Public Domains', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tumor Subtype', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'computerized tools', 'data pipeline', 'exceptional responders', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'individual patient', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'neoplastic cell', 'network models', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,U24,2020,442117,0.03126278821829813
"NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION ABSTRACT This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-CA-17-025. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the few cancers with increasing incidence in the United States. Survival of patients with HCC is poor because most patients are diagnosed at late stages when treatment options are limited. HCC surveillance can detect cancers early and improve survival but it is inconsistently implemented. Not all liver nodules detected on surveillance imaging are malignant, these indeterminate nodules require follow up imaging to determine if they are HCC. This proposal assembles a team of specialists with complementary expertise in liver diseases, liver cancer, radiology, engineering, statistics, and information technology. The goals are to: (1) Improve HCC surveillance uptake in patients with cirrhosis by leveraging electronic medical records to remind healthcare providers and patients when they are due for screening tests; (2) Leverage analytic morphomics and machine learning to increase the detectability of HCC at an early stage; and (3) Increase detectability of HCC at an early stage using tagged HCC-specific peptides. We have worked closely together for many years and have participated/led many NIH funded clinical research networks. We have expertise and experience to carry out the proposed studies and will collaborate with other centers in the Liver Center Network to validate the methods/models we develop. We will also enroll patients with cirrhosis and collect data and specimens and provide access to existing well characterized data and specimen repositories that include both prevalent and incident HCC for Trans-Network studies. We are confident we will be able to contribute to this Liver Cancer Network and to early detection of HCC in multiple ways. SIGNIFICANCE Regular screening of patients with cirrhosis can diagnose liver cancer early and improve survival but it is inconsistently done. We assembled a team of experts with complementary expertise to increase liver cancer screening using electronic medical record system to send reminders to healthcare providers and patients. Additionally, we use two novel methods to improve our ability to differentiate malignant from benign liver nodules allowing liver cancer to be diagnosed earlier.",NOVEL STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE LIVER CANCER SURVEILLANCE UPTAKE AND EARLY DETECTION,9997848,U01CA230669,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Binding', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'GPC3 gene', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Hepatitis C', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Technology', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Organ', 'Pancreatic Diseases', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Populations at Risk', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective Studies', 'Provider', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specimen', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'baby boomer', 'base', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'patient-level barriers', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'radiomics', 'repository', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'statistics', 'surveillance imaging', 'surveillance strategy', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,791318,0.03672117475838184

"Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the 6th leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Although up to 40% of adult patients are responsive to standard chemotherapy, almost all relapse and progress to resistant disease. Most AML patients display no cytogenetic abnormalities or driver mutations, which poses a significant challenge for designing targeted therapy. Combination therapy may also be useful for preventing resistance and improving overall survival. Recent advances in epigenomics have shed light on cellular reprogramming in cancer. Epigenetic proteins can modulate gene expression to induce pathways that increase cell proliferation and decrease differentiation. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is an epigenetic protein overexpressed in AML. CARM1 has been identified as a key regulator of myeloid differentiation and cancer progression; and is overexpressed in primary, resistant, and recurrent AML. CARM1’s mechanistic role in AML induction and progression (including relevant substrates and regulation) is still unclear, which presents an additional challenge for clinicians to design new therapies. To address gaps in our current understanding of CARM1 function and the need for new AML therapies, I aim to (1) Identify compounds that target CARM1 expression and compounds that work in synergy with a known CARM1 inhibitor in AML and (2) Identify novel chemotypes that directly inhibit CARM1 using a hybrid approach of machine learning and simulations of small molecule-protein interactions. These aims support key goals of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Precision Medicine Initiative, including (1) understanding cancer progression, (2) genomic analysis, (3) advancing precision medicine, (4) bioinformatics and (5) translational research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow, where immature cells accumulate and disrupt the production of normal blood cells, disrupting normal blood formation and organ function. Despite advances in research, AML patients are typically treated with chemotherapy agents that often fail to cure them and frequently lead to relapse. We propose to create new therapies for repressing AML based on targeting the epigenome, or the pattern of chemical modification of DNA and histones, the proteins that package and order DNA to promote gene expression.",Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML,9812180,F31CA228331,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Apoptosis', 'Arginine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Docking', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Embryonic Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histones', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Bone Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Myelogenous', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Network-based', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'acute myeloid leukemia cell', 'analog', 'base', 'blood formation', 'chemotherapy', 'coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2020,50520,0.029715728460968056
"Low-Cost and Compact Multimodal Intraoral Confocal Probe for Oral Cancer Detection and Diagnosis Abstract Oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) together rank as the sixth most common cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 400,000 new cases each year. The 5-year survival rate in the U.S. for OSCC is 62%, the survival rate is only 10-40% and the cure rate around 30% in the developing world. Low survival rate is primarily attributed to the delay in diagnosis and the resultant progression of disease to an advanced stage at diagnosis. Early diagnosis offers the best chance to improved treatment outcomes and survival for an individual diagnosed with OSCC. The objective of this proposed project focuses on developing and evaluating a low-cost, compact, smartphone compatible multimodal intraoral confocal probe for noninvasive in situ detection of oral dysplasia and early stage cancer. The key innovation of the proposed intraoral confocal probe is low-cost and compact confocal intraoral probe using actively addressable point source array - microLED (µLED) without any moving parts to achieve 3D confocal imaging. The wide-FOV autofluorescence imaging (AFI) and polarized white light imaging (pWLI) will identify the suspicious regions with the help of trained neural network and guide confocal scan to obtain tissue microstructure for accurate diagnosis. We will achieve this objective through the following two Aims: (1) develop multimodal confocal imaging probe with µLED array and (2) evaluate the performance and clinical feasibility of multimodal intraoral probe. The proposed project has a great significance. The compact, multimodal handheld intraoral imaging probe, in conjunction with the deep learning image classification method, will enable noninvasive in situ early detection and diagnosis of oral dysplasia and cancer from benign conditions in a clinical setting, significantly reducing disease progression, reducing death rates from oral cancer and improving the quality of life.

"Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens Project Summary Cancer immunotherapy is now established as a major therapeutic modality. Significant progress with checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies demonstrates durable tumor regression in metastatic melanoma, lung cancer and other malignancies. One conspicuous limitation is the paucity of validated tumor antigens, which impedes clinical investigators in their pursuit of developing new cancer immunotherapies. Tumor encoded non-synonymous mutations may provide a new source of potential target antigens. T cells recognize tumor missense mutations as amino acid substituted peptides presented in the context of major histocompatibility molecules on the cancer cell surface, thus implicating missense mutations as a source of patient-specific neoantigens. We recently described the first-in-human study to use next generation sequencing technologies to identify and validate tumor missense mutations as neoantigens. Our study demonstrates that vaccination increases the breadth and diversity of neoantigen-specific T cells resulting in a broad repertoire of effector CD8+ T cells that uniquely discriminates mutated antigens from wild type peptides ensuring tumor specificity. This proposal aims to find a unique solution to the scarcity of tumor antigens by developing a neoantigen discovery pipeline that integrates genomic and proteomic technologies. In this proposal, a unique academic-industry partnership comprised of an established team of experts, in cancer genomics, cancer proteomics, human immunology, and clinical oncology, aim to solve the challenging problem of tumor neoantigen discovery. The long-term goal is to develop a robust pipeline using cutting-edge technologies merged with machine learning algorithms to supply tumor neoantigens for clinical investigation. The goal of this proposal will be addressed in the experiments of the following specific aims: 1) to identify the repertoire of melanoma expressed somatic mutations by next generation sequencing technologies; 2) to develop a novel proteomics platform to identify melanoma neoantigens presented by HLA class I molecules; 3) to validate neoantigen identification in a vaccination protocol. The proposed pipeline will deliver a transformative solution for tumor antigen identification, should be translatable to other “immune responsive“ malignancies and enable the nascent discipline of precision medicine to provide effective and safe immunotherapies for cancer patients. Project Narrative This project is relevant to public health as it aims to develop a neoantigen discovery pipeline to address the paucity of validated cancer antigens available for immunotherapy. The pipeline integrates two powerful and well-established technologies, genomics and proteomics. If successful, this pipeline will enable the delivery of precision immunotherapy in a clinically relevant timeframe for patients with melanoma as well as other malignancies.",Integrated Discovery Pipeline for Tumor Neoantigens,10000066,R01CA204261,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Antitumor Response', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell surface', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Complementary DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ensure', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incentives', 'Institutes', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mutate', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Surface Antigens', 'T cell response', 'T cell therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer proteomics', 'candidate selection', 'clinical investigation', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'human subject', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'industry partner', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'melanoma', 'mutant', 'neoantigens', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'nonsynonymous mutation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,541899,0.06555928280115578
"Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer Abstract Head and neck cancers are the fifth most common cancer type in the United States, with an overall survival rate lower than 50%. Although the incidence of other sub-sites of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in past decades, the number of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) cases has increased significantly. Most OPSCC patients receive standard cancer therapy.4 However, the clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Predicting early in treatment whether a tumor is likely to respond to treatment is one of the most difficult yet important tasks in providing individualized cancer care.  Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known driving oncogenic factor in oropharyngeal cancer, as well as a significant prognostic biomarker for patient survival. Retrospective studies conducted by the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium (INHANCE) have demonstrated that clinical biomarkers have prognostic value in helping stratify OPSCC patients into groups with differing risks of death or disease progression. However, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer patients have similar rates of metastatic spread to HPV-negative patients. The same is true for patient groups stratified with other clinical biomarkers. More robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for optimally effective treatment.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. Multiple studies indicate that miRNAs are promising cancer biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in oropharyngeal cancer. Imaging features extracted from medical images are an exciting new class of cancer biomarkers for characterizing tumor habitats. For several tumor sites, imaging biomarkers have shown promise in accurately separating favorable and unfavorable prognosis patients. However, current efforts to utilize high-dimensional multimodal biomarkers for treatment outcome prediction have been compromised by small patient numbers relative to the feature space dimensionality; feature redundancy, heterogeneity, and uncertainty; and patient cohorts with unbalanced outcomes. The correlation, independence, and complementary nature of multimodal biomarkers (imaging, miRNA, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers) remains unexplored as well.  The major goal of this research is to develop a multimodal biomarker-based model that can reliably predict subsets of OPSCC patients with low and high risks for treatment failure. The model will serve as a clinical decision-making tool. Specifically, we propose a novel principle and systematic machine learning-based strategy to effectively identify and seamlessly combine prognostic information carried by multimodal biomarkers. Aim 1: Identify prognostic multimodal biomarkers, given OPSCC patient data. Aim 2: Develop and test a comprehensive multimodal biomarker-based model for predicting OPSCC treatment outcomes. Aim 3: Assess the clinical benefit of the model for OPSCC patient stratification and individualized treatment. Narrative The achievement of this project forms a basis of combining non-invasive imaging biomarkers with miRNAs, HPV, clinical, and histopathologic biomarkers for accurate cancer prognosis and discovering the correlation with genetic mechanisms leading to specific tumor phenotypes. This clinical decision-making tool can provide useful information to support patient stratification and individualized treatment. We anticipate that many of the methodological improvements established in this proposal will improve oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treatment and tumor response assessment and treatment in other disease sites as well.",Multimodal Biomarkers For Oropharyngeal Cancer,9994253,R01CA233873,"['Achievement', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Family', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2020,416519,0.03793507801671046
"Engineering personalized micro-tumor ecosystems Abstract Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, accounting for near 1 in every 4 deaths. However, despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, many cancer treatments still have low efficacy which mostly arise from the limited ability to predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents. The major reason that current therapeutics often cannot translate into a successful clinical outcomes is because of the complex tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity that limit the predictive power of the biomarker-guided strategies for chemotherapy. Therefore, the successful engineering of personalized three-dimensional (3D) tumor ecosystem that can recapitulate the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in vitro is strongly desired to accurately predict patients’ responses to anti-cancer drugs and thus further improve patient outcome. Here we propose to develop a personalized breast-cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform for personalized screening of cancer chemotherapeutics with high accuracy by utilizing patient-derived tumor explant, defined tumor grade-matched biomaterial matrices and autologous patient serum to mimic patient-specific tumor hallmarks. The proposed cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip will also be tightly regulated under physiological fluid dynamics. In this project, we have hypothesized that 1) the use of tumor explant will embrace the critical components of the tumor heterogeneity of the patient, 2) the combination of defined tumor grade-matched matrix, autologous patient serum, and a microfluidic bioreactor will prevent the phenotype alteration of the tumor explant, and 3) the integration of a machine-learning algorithm with the cancer-ecosystem-on-a-chip platform will provide more accurate, unbiased prediction of the patient responses to chemotherapeutics based on the data gathered from the engineered tumor model. Our preliminary results show that the combination of tumor explant culture and tumor-derived matrix constituents had predicted therapeutic responses with 100% sensitivity. Our preliminary results show high specificity throughout a range of cancers including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and thus the findings can have broad applications, and can emerge as a paradigm shift in the management of cancer. Narrative Despite the recent development of subtype-specific personalized therapy based on achievements in the fields of molecular and genetic profiling, the cancer treatment still has low efficacy that mostly arise from the limited ability of existing models to recapitulate the tumor heterogeneity and therefore predict the patient tumor responses to therapeutic agents.

"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. The influence of daily rhythms on cancer biology and treatment is particularly strong.

"Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In solid tumors, current limitations in our ability to identify the cell(s) of origin, track the dynamics of tumor subclonal architecture over space and time, and predict drug sensitivities in a mechanistic fashion pose significant challenges to our ability to develop effective treatments and undermine the utility of available therapies, particularly in tumors that become resistant. In this proposal, we argue that approaches based in mathematics and physics are well suited for addressing these critical problems. Historically, the physical sciences have been successful in solving fundamental scientific problems by producing reductionist models that enable the development of conceptual premises, technological breakthroughs that enable new kinds of measurements, and mathematical tools that can accurately represent and predict future activity. In this new Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC), our goal is to develop, validate, and deliver a set of complementary mathematical, technological, and computational approaches that will provide the cancer research community with a framework for unraveling complexity in solid tumors, with the long-term aim of improving diagnosis and treatment. More specifically, the Center's primary research focus will be to study evolution and heterogeneity of solid tumors at the single cell level, by developing lineage tracing techniques in organoid and in vivo systems, single cell sequencing in primary tumors, and emerging genomics-based approaches for identifying targeted therapies. These experimental approaches will be supported by the development of novel, robust, and effective mathematical and computational approaches based in the field of topology, which offers unique and powerful methods for addressing the essential challenge of interpreting the high-dimensional data sets that state-of-the- art genomics technologies generate. In addition, we will promote the integration of physical science approaches into cancer research by both training new researchers and engaging established researchers working at the intersection of the physical sciences and cancer biology. Each of the projects and cores will address technical, mathematical, and biological challenges, contributing to the global enterprise of cancer research and to the development of a broader network of interdisciplinary researchers committed to advancing the field. If successful, we will be able to provide the scientific community with experimentally validated geometric and topological structures of causal inference of clonal evolution, single cell genomic protocols for fast and reliable uncovering of clonal heterogeneity, experimentally validated machine learning approaches for predicting drug sensitivities, and a strong multi-institutional, interdisciplinary program that creates bridges between researchers in pure mathematics, the technology sector, and cancer research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer heterogeneity has been postulated as a major evolutionary force behind drug resistance. The Columbia University Physical Sciences-Oncology Center for Topology of Cancer Evolution and Heterogeneity (CUPS-OC) will develop quantitative approaches to understand, study and find potential novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of solid tumors.

"SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes Project Summary/Abstract For ovarian cancer (OvCa), only 27% of women diagnosed at advanced stages survive 5 years, yet more than 90% of patients survive when diagnosed at an earlier stage. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new non- invasive technologies capable of rapidly diagnosing ovarian cancers (OvCa) in early stage. Fortuitously, all cells (and tumor cells to a greater extent) expel nanoscale vesicles that are directly reflective of the biological state of their parent cells. A subset of circulating EVs known as exosomes are composed of biomolecules spanning the range of lipids, proteins, genes, and more, and hold great potential for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Yet current methods for phenotyping biofluids according to detection of tumor-associated exosomes (TEXs) are not meeting clinical standards and fail to precisely capture particle to particle heterogeneity. We propose to develop a new nanoplasmonics-based technology for sensitive detection of cancer-related exosome bio-signatures enabled by multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, that we call ExoSERS. Our approach encompasses three aims devised to realize the ExoSERS platform. Aim 1 outlines development of a new class of Raman-active ligands to serve as the molecular barcodes. This aim encompasses the design and synthesis of polyyne-based ligands designed to confer Raman spectroscopic encoding and also initiate a silane coating to form a protecting shell around a nanoplasmonic core. Aim 2 describes the synthesis and optimization of nanoplasmonic core-shell structures that will be well-suited to binding EVs. An inner gold core structure yields plasmonic enhancement, while the outer silica shell permits long-term stability and a convenient surface for covalent decoration with exosome and cancer-specific surface marker targeting agents. Aim 3 comprises validation of the platform’s feasibility to profile human OvCa patient plasma, including machine learning approaches to type cancers using the barcoded approach. Endpoints of platform characterization will be statistical validation of exosome detection efficiency, minimal sample volume needed, ease of utilization, and low cost. Several quantitative milestones have been proposed to gauge our progress and provide deliverables to the larger diagnostic and circulating biomarker communities. Project Narrative All cells dynamically excrete into circulation nano-sized packages called extracellular vesicles (EVs), but this pathway can be hijacked by cancer cells for means of immune system suppression and metastasis. Innovative cross-disciplinary engineering methods are urgently needed to realize the diagnostic application of circulating cancer EVs to improve early detection of diseases like ovarian cancer, which do not have effective early screening tests. This project encompasses the design of highly multiplexed new nanoplasmonic probes for sensitive chemical fingerprinting of targeted circulating EVs, to ultimately improve the limit of detection for diagnosing ovarian cancer compared to conventional methods.",SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes,9973569,R01CA241666,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'CA-125 Antigen', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fingerprint', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune system', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nanostructures', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Silanes', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'Width', 'Woman', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer drug resistance', 'cancer type', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'early screening', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'multiplex detection', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoplasmonic', 'nanoscale', 'nanosized', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'particle', 'plasmonics', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recruit', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vesicle transport', 'vesicular release']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,564554,0.05587535656861158
"Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Health disparities exist in cancer screening and mortality. Although cancer mortality rates have decreased steadily over the past 25 years, the racial gap persists, and socioeconomic disparities are widening. Improved early detection and treatment can decrease cancer mortality, but many barriers exist to screening uptake. Cancer screening is often a trade-off for both patients and clinicians among different cancer screenings and other preventive opportunities, each of which have their own barriers to completion. This study seeks to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities in cancer mortality by using informatics to better tailor clinical discussions in order to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and help overcome barriers to screening. The study has the following aims: 1) to develop a predictive model that identifies patients > 50 years old eligible for lung, breast and colorectal cancer screening who are at high-risk for missing these screenings; 2) to develop and pilot test a prototype shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians that will increase screening uptake; 3) to perform a pragmatic trial of the refined multilevel intervention that utilizes a shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians.  During the planning phase, data from the electronic health record (EHR) will be combined with supplementary data sources (e.g. Area Health Resource File, LexisNexis) to identify patients at risk of not completing recommended screening for these cancers. Hold-out cross-validation will be used to estimate model accuracy. Machine learning model building following feature selection will utilize logistic regression and decision trees to ensure the models are easily transferable to other healthcare settings and interpretable. This predictive model will be used to develop and pilot test an application that will (A) utilize predictive modeling to identify eligible patients likely to miss screening; (B) determine, after providing patient education, patient preferences and concerns regarding screening through self-report augmented by predictive modelling; (C) identify available community resources to facilitate screening; (D) provide this information to patients and to clinicians in the EHR prior to clinical visits to assist shared decision-making conversations and support active problem solving of identified barriers. This multilevel intervention will be pilot-tested and refined within 4 academic primary care practices over 6 months (N=24 clinicians; 8181 potential screenings yearly). A pragmatic trial will be conducted during the R33 phase using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design (N=45 clinicians; 11,239 potential screenings yearly). Completed cancer screening will be the primary outcome. Patient experience, clinician satisfaction and utilization will also be assessed. If successful, this approach will lead to an intervention tailored to the patient and their community that leverages information technology in a scalable way that is transferrable to other clinical settings and types of preventive services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant disparities exist in breast, colorectal and lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer mortality, requiring the development of new interventions that increase screening uptake in diverse populations. We propose an intervention that employs a multilevel approach that leverages the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supplementary data sources to develop a predictive model to identify eligible patients at high-risk of not obtaining screening and to facilitate improved shared decision-making conversations using an EHR based decision-making support tool that interacts with patients and clinicians. By personalizing the approach to screening and improving the quality of patient-clinician interactions, we hope to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and reduce health disparities.",Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention,10051055,R61AG068951,"['Advisory Committees', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Preventive screening', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural Community', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer type', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'mortality', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'regression trees', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sex', 'shared decision making', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R61,2020,279223,-0.010471956394261838
"Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered nearly every facet of daily life. Although social and physical distancing constraints appear to be slowing the spread of the disease, they may be adversely affecting cancer- related preventive behaviors and accessibility to medical services, including cancer treatment. The impact of such COVID-19 restrictions must be quantified to understand and mitigate short- and long-term effects across the cancer continuum, especially among vulnerable populations, including American Indian adults. The goal of this study is to explore how differences in demographics (e.g., age, sex, educational attainment) may impact engagement in cancer preventive behaviors (e.g., tobacco cessation, cancer screening) and cancer management/survivorship behaviors (e.g., access to cancer treatment services) in the context of COVID-19 restrictions (e.g., social distancing, alterations in work arrangements) by surveying a sample of 1,000 American Indian adults, including those who have never had cancer, cancer patients and cancer survivors. This study will be conducted by the Stephenson Cancer Center Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) program in close coordination with three American Indian tribal nations, Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, Chickasaw Nation, and Cherokee Nation, and the Oklahoma Area Tribal Epidemiology Center. This goal will be achieved by completing three specific aims: (1) to develop and administer a survey exploring the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on cancer prevention and control behaviors. This survey will include a core set of common data elements that will be administered by several NCI-designated Cancer Centers to increase the depth and generalizability of findings; (2) to develop an accurate and robust data integration method using novel machine learning and propensity score weighting approaches to improve the representativeness of the sample of American Indian adults that will be drawn in Oklahoma; and (3) to analyze data to inform tribes, healthcare delivery systems serving American Indian patients, and Stephenson Cancer Center research program members and clinicians regarding how American Indian adults are being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings will be used to inform interventions and policies aimed at mitigating the cancer-relevant effects of COVID-19 restrictions in a highly vulnerable group residing within the Stephenson Cancer Center catchment area of Oklahoma. Future iterations of the survey to monitor trends over time are planned. A timeline of COVID-19 related guidance, restrictions or regulatory mandates that have been enacted at the national, state and tribal levels will be constructed to form a context that will allow for meaningful interpretation of findings by tribal community leaders and researchers. The impact of COVID-19 social and physical distancing restrictions on cancer preventive behaviors and access to healthcare, including cancer treatment, must be quantified to understand and mitigate effects of these restrictions on vulnerable groups. The exclusive focus of this study on American Indian adults with and without cancer will provide needed information in a population that may be especially vulnerable to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.",Stephenson Cancer Center - Cancer Center Support Grant,10149784,P30CA225520,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alaska Native', 'American', 'American Indians', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Center Support Grant', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Cherokee Indian', 'Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma', 'Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Community Surveys', 'Country', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Life', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'NCI-Designated Cancer Center', 'Occupations', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Probability Samples', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Distance', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Time trend', 'TimeLine', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tribes', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'college', 'data integration', 'demographics', 'economic impact', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'member', 'novel', 'programs', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment services', 'tribal Nation', 'tribal community', 'tribal health', 'urban residence']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,P30,2020,145000,0.0828944225331486
"Hardwiring Mechanism into Predicting Cancer Phenotypes by Computational Learning DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Few biomarkers derived from genome scale data have translated into improved clinical classification of cancer subtypes, in spite of the wealth of available genome-wide studies and of the corresponding application of numerous statistical algorithms. This widespread shortcoming derives from the pervasive use of ""off the shelf"" algorithms and machine learning techniques developed for image classification and language processing, which are naïve of the underlying biology of the system. Furthermore, for genome-wide data, the number of samples is often small relative to the number of potential candidate biomarkers, resulting in variable accuracy on independent test data despite high accuracy in the samples used for discovery, which contributes to the failure of clinical biomarkers. This problem - so called ""curse of dimensionality"" - is further exacerbated by the prohibitive cost of dramatically increasing sample size and by patient stratification into smaller subgroups for personalized and precision medicine. Disease phenotypes arise from distinct and specific perturbations in selected networks and pathways defined by the interactions of their molecular constituents. In cancer, these perturbations may reside in gene regulatory networks topology and state, in cell signaling activity, or in metabolic conditions. We hypothesize that by leveragin such prior biological information on cancer biology we will be able to reduce model complexity and build mechanistically justified predictive models. To pursue this hypothesis, we will develop an analytical framework to embed mechanistic constraints derived from network biology into the statistical learning process itself. Hence, this application will develop a novel suite of statistial learning algorithms that embed (Aim 1) gene expression regulatory networks, (Aim 2) cell signaling activity, and (Aim 3) metabolism to classify breast and prostate cancer. Throughout the study we will work closely with clinical collaborators to ensure that our method improve over and above current predictive and prognostic models. Finally, since in our study we will also generate mechanistic classifiers based on gene expression measurements obtained from clinical assays that are already commercially available (i.e., MammaPrint®, and Decipher®), our innovative models and predictors will be also readily available for clinical translation. Our mechanism-driven classifiers will simultaneously have greater accuracy and interpretability than classifiers developed without regard for the underlying biology of the disease. Furthermore, embedding biological mechanisms in the classifiers will also facilitate the identification of alternative therapeutic targets specific to each cancer subtype, potentially improving patient prognosis and health outcomes. Finally, the substantial curation of molecular pathways and biological networks we will carry on in the project will also provide a powerful resource for futur studies, and the methodologies we will develop will be also applicable to other cancer and other human diseases, like neurodegenerative disorders, hearth disease, and diabetes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Project Narrative This study will use mechanistic biological knowledge to implement a suite of statistical algorithms for cancer patient classification, which will also reveal the biological reasoning behind the classification decision rules. In the study we will also apply our novel methods to develop improved biomarkers for breast and prostate cancer patient clinical stratification, with the ultimate goal of facilitating the selection of appropriate treatment. To achieve this goal we will directly improve the existing commercial tests offered to the patients, with an immediate clinical impact, since our biomarkers will be directly implementable into these assays, with the potential to quickly reach the bedside.",Hardwiring Mechanism into Predicting Cancer Phenotypes by Computational Learning,9881257,R01CA200859,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Models', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Subgroup', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker development', 'cancer cell', 'cancer classification', 'cancer subtypes', 'candidate marker', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data quality', 'disease phenotype', 'functional group', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized health care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,150129,0.020420584775503965
"Characterization and modeling of m6A RNA methylation in cancer ABSTRACT The most abundant internal mRNA modification is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and growing evidence has suggested its critical roles in cancer. However, the global patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators over large patient cohorts are not available. It remains unclear how m6A RNA modification contributes to cancer initiation/progression and how it may be used in cancer therapy. The objective is to systematically characterize the genome-wide patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators using well-characterized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient cohorts, elucidate their interactions with other molecular aberrations, and assess their potential clinical utility. The working hypothesis is that the dysregulation of m6A RNA methylation plays critical roles in cancer development and may represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We will pursue three specific aims: Aim #1. Generate the genome-wide profiles of m6A RNA methylation using TCGA sample cohorts. As part of an NCI Functional Proteomic Center, our team has unique access to these samples. We have developed a sensitive, robust m6A-seq protocol, and will apply it to ~1,000 patient samples from diverse cancer types, and generate high-quality, standardized m6A genome-wide profile data. Aim #2. Generate the protein expression profiles of m6A regulators using TCGA sample cohorts. Using the MD Anderson reverse-phase protein array platform, we will characterize the expression levels of ~30 protein markers (including both total and phosphorylated proteins) of 15 m6A regulators (five writers, two readers, and eight erasers) over ~8,000 samples of 31 cancer types as well as ~400 common cancer cell lines. Aim #3. Perform the integrative analysis and modeling of m6A RNA methylation data in a rich TCGA context. Using TCGA multi-dimensional molecular data, we will develop predictive models that quantify the effects of various factors involved in m6A RNA modification by deep learning. We will perform analyses to define m6A-based tumor subtypes, assess the clinical utility of m6A-related markers, and study the interactions of m6A with other molecular aberrations in diverse tumor contexts. Finally, we will build a publicly available, user-friendly database that will contain comprehensive information of the m6A data generated through Aim #1 and Aim #2. The expected outcome of this project is (i) the establishment of an integrated resource of m6A-related genomic and proteomic data based on the most widely used cancer patient cohorts, so that further investigation of such data can be conducted by the cancer research community fluently; and (ii) assessment of the biological and clinical utility of m6A RNA methylation for cancer therapy in a comprehensive way. This project is innovative because it will systematically assess the clinical relevance and functions of a key class of RNA modifications that are currently understudied in cancer research. These results will have an important positive impact because the knowledge gained will not only greatly advance our understanding of the role of m6A RNA methylation in cancer development, but also directly facilitate the development of a novel class of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because systematic characterization of RNA modifications in large, well-characterized clinical patient cohorts is expected to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of human cancers, thereby helping the development of more effective treatment approaches. Thus, this project is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of human disability.",Characterization and modeling of m6A RNA methylation in cancer,10027689,R01CA251150,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Chicago', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polyadenylation', 'Process', 'Protein Array', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA methylation', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin Cancer', 'Standardization', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor Subtype', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'biomedical resource', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2020,565529,0.034766588953100405
"Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing Project Summary/Abstract Clinical data collection is accelerating rapidly, and in the future it will include both provider- and patient- generated data. Hidden within this mass of noisy observational data are clues as to factors influencing disease onset and outcome. Finding ways to exploit this trove of disease data can unlock a new perspective on disease processes. We can tackle disease both from the bottom-up, from experimental data generated in the laboratory, and from the top down, from clinical phenomena observed across human populations. A particularly impactful and prevalent disease is cancer. Each tumor harbors a unique combination of mutations driving a distinct set of oncogenic processes. Targeted therapies have been proposed to pinpoint these mutations, potentially requiring a vast array of therapeutic options. Cancer treatment often fails when drug resistance arises, another result of the complex combinatorial nature of tumor alterations. Combination therapies have been proposed as an approach to interfere with multiple disease signals simultaneously. However, identifying effective drug combinations, and the cancer types in which they are effective, is experimentally infeasible, leading to a push for computational solutions. In this proposal, we combine methods from social sciences and biostatistics to find the causal effect of a drug on cancer onset from observational clinical data. Both increased and decreased cancer rates in drug-takers are of equal interest, as they can inform us of disease processes and provide clinical impact. We are particularly interested in finding drug combinations that impact cancer. These combination effects are unlikely to have been detected, and our clinical data provides a unique resource for observing the effects of tens of thousands of drug combinations. We will pool the resulting causal drug effect estimates across the many cancers present in our data. To gain insight into the cellular processes underlying clinical effect, we will examine the impact of known cancer-causing drugs in vitro, using large public cell line assays. The accompanying goal is to provide Dr. Rachel Melamed with a career development experience to become an independent scientist. Her research will use observational health data to understand the genesis of cancer, prevent the disease, and discover new therapeutic options. This proposal takes advantage of the interdisciplinary strengths of the University of Chicago in computation, biostatistics, and medicine, as well as institutional resources in terms of data access and infrastructure. Dr. Melamed has assembled a team consisting of complementary mentors and collaborators with expertise in computation, statistics, translational medicine, personalized therapy, and cancer therapy. The career development plan focuses on enhancing her statistics and machine learning skills with structured coursework and mentorship, and gaining experience in biomedical applications via applied work and mentorship. This will provide Dr. Melamed with skills to model observational data and to integrate the results with experimental data. Project Narrative Clinical data has been shown to hold patterns relating drugs to cancer onset. Using this data to find drugs that increase cancer rates will provide insight into the disease and an opportunity for preventing some cancer cases. Discovery of drugs, and particularly drug combinations, that reduce cancer rates could suggest low-cost new therapeutic options.",Using clinical data to identify FDA-approved drugs for cancer prevention and therapeutic repurposing,9963220,K01ES028055,"['Adverse event', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cancerous', 'Case Series', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug usage', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Skill', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career development', 'clinical effect', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically relevant', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data access', 'data infrastructure', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disorder risk', 'econometrics', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'gene discovery', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'life history', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'premalignant', 'premature', 'prevent', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'training opportunity', 'translational medicine', 'tumor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K01,2020,124953,0.05142677019488783
"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,9831048,R01CA163336,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'TERT gene', 'Techniques', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'knowledge of results', 'melanoma', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'resistance mechanism', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2020,326848,0.04833769808865616
"Optimizing delivery of ethyl cellulose ethanol for ablation of cervical precancer ABSTRACT Cervical cancer affects the lives of half a million women worldwide each year. Over half of these women die, even though cervical cancer is highly preventable through vaccination or early screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical pre-cancer. Cervical cancer prevention consists of three visits in the U.S.: 1) screening using the Papanicolaou smear; 2) colposcopy followed by biopsy of cervical abnormalities for women with positive screening results; 3) treatment by excising the lesion using a Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure (LEEP) for women with cervical pre-cancer. This three-visit model is not practical for use in medically underserved regions due to the technologies and expertise needed and patient attrition between clinic visits. Our team has already developed a novel Pocket colposcope and machine learning algorithms that when combined provide high-quality, magnified visualization and automated diagnosis with comparable performance to standard-of-care colposcopy. However, screening and diagnosis alone will not lead to decreases in cervical cancer mortality if access to point-of-care treatment is limited. Recently, the thermocoagulator has gained acceptance for ablation of cervical pre-cancer lesions as it does not require consumables (continuous supply of pressurized liquid nitrogen for cryotherapy) or a stable power supply (for LEEP). However, low-cost thermocoagulators have frequent failures based on reports of field-testing and the more reliable versions cost more than $10k. To address these well-documented shortcomings, our group is working to establish a low-cost ablative therapy using a ubiquitous agent, ethanol to treat cervical pre-cancer. While ethanol ablation has a long history of clinical use, its direct injection into tissue leads to non-uniform distribution and hence low efficacy in the region of interest. We propose a new formulation of ethanol using a polymer called ethyl cellulose (generally regarded as safe by the FDA), which will act as a slow release gel without off target toxicity, and an automated injector to control delivery of ethanol-ethyl cellulose (EEC) into the region of interest. The goal of this Phase I SBIR grant is to establish controlled delivery of EEC for cervical pre-cancer treatment using a combination of tissue surrogates and ex vivo and in vivo models of the swine cervix to induce a zone of necrosis that is consistent with thermocoagulation, a commonly used ablation method. In Aim 1, an automated needle injector will be designed for reproducible EEC delivery in tissue surrogates by maximizing the ratio of distributed to injected volume and minimizing back flow and crack formation. In Aim 2, the automated needle injector will be tested in ex vivo swine cervices to establish the distribution of the agent within the defined region of interest and also to determine the number of injections needed to achieve optimal coverage. In Aim 3, the injector safety and efficacy will be tested in in vivo swine cervices to establish the distribution volume and zone of necrosis caused by EEC. The results from the Phase I SBIR will set the foundation for development of alpha and beta versions of the automated needle injector, quality control assessment and packaging of the EEC injectate, and submission of an IND for EEC to the FDA. The goal of this SBIR is for PIs from academic and small business institutions to work in partnership to develop a technological strategy that will transform treatment of cervical pre-cancer in low-resource communities. The proposed research is significantly relevant to public health, as the developed technologies will contribute to the improvement of cervical cancer prevention, and thus a reduction in the mortality rate of this imminently preventable disease.",Optimizing delivery of ethyl cellulose ethanol for ablation of cervical precancer,10140866,R43CA257303,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Benchmarking', 'Businesses', 'Caliber', 'Cellulose', 'Cervical', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cold Therapy', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Ethanol', 'Excision', 'Extravasation', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Field Reports', 'Fluorescein', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Improve Access', 'Income', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Necrosis', 'Needles', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pap smear', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Power Sources', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Screening Result', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stains', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Vaccination', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'cervical biopsy', 'cervical cancer prevention', 'cost', 'design', 'early screening', 'experience', 'field study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'loop electrosurgical excision procedure', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'preclinical study', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'screening', 'standard of care']",NCI,CALLA HEALTH FOUNDATION,R43,2020,300000,0.02840033415418187
"(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy This proposal combines a team with expertise in aging, tumor immunology, tumor immunotherapy, specific genetically modified animal models and early phase clinical trials with a computational team having great expertise in analyzing and modeling aging of the immune system. We will study age effects on PD-L1/PD-1 signaling in the host and the tumor focusing on melanoma with some bladder cancer work, two tumors that are highly responsive to αPD-1 and/or αPD-L1 as proofs-of-concept, and residing in distinct anatomic compartments. In Aim 1 we study tumor PD-L1 intrinsic effects on αPD-L1 and αPD-1 treatment in melanoma and bladder cancer using transplantable B16 and inducible Nras/Cdk2n melanoma models, and transplantable MB49 and BBN-induced tumors for bladder cancer studies. We also use novel melanoma and BC models with tumor cell- specific PD-L1KO. We study 3 cohorts of elderly versus younger humans getting αPD-L1 or αPD-1 for melanoma or bladder cancer for human validation. We measure high-dimensional cell phenotypes and signaling responses, proteins and genes to maximize the information collected from human samples and mice using 23-color FACS, CyTOF, Luminex, Nanostring and other approaches. In Aim 2 we use all the above models and analytic strategies in young and aged PD-L1KO mice and WT or bone marrow chimeras to test hematopoietic and non- hematopoietic (host) PD-L1 signals in treatment outcomes in melanoma and bladder cancer. In Aim 3 the Systems Immunology team will use their innovative and successful computational modeling to identify age- related co-predictors of immunotherapy response and to identify candidate mechanisms for responders and non- responders. We will define a trajectory of immune system aging in mice at ultra-high resolution by performing a systems level integrative analysis of aging in Collaborative Cross and BL6 mice tracked in a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study. This trajectory will be used to understand how tumor response and treatment outcomes vary as a function of age, and to build a simple, low parameter (i.e., easily testable and clinically translated), predictive models of treatment response. We will test insights by analyzing immune data from aged versus young patients undergoing αPD-L1 and αPD-1 cancer immunotherapy in novel machine learning approaches that we pioneered to identify insights from mouse data that are relevant to humans. Coupling this disease information with the healthy human aging trajectory that we recently defined will allow us to adapt our mouse data to predict optimal treatments in humans based on chronological and immune aging. This combined trans-disciplinary approach will identify common age-related disabilities that reduce PD-L1/PD-1 based immunotherapy responses and suggest tailored treatments for optimal efficacy that could later be tested in validation sets. These data can also be applied to other types of immunotherapy as we will also test. Cancer is a disease of the aged, but therapies are generally modeled in the young. We study age effects on cancer immunotherapy in response to PQ2 to develop ways to optimize cancer immunotherapy in aged patients most at risk. We focus on the PD-L1/PD-1 axis that is the cornerstone of the most successful cancer immunotherapies to date.",(PQ2) PD-L1/PD-1 signals in aged hosts undergoing cancer immunotherapy,10000083,R01CA231325,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Appearance', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Blocking Antibodies', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chimera organism', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Coupling', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Genes', 'Genetically Modified Animals', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'PD-1/PD-L1', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Validation', 'Work', 'age effect', 'age related', 'aged', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-L1', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cell dimension', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'early phase clinical trial', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'immune checkpoint', 'immune function', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'metagenome', 'mouse model', 'nano-string', 'neoplasm immunotherapy', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'preclinical study', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microenvironment', 'ultra high resolution']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R01,2020,623486,-0.0005139040325077091
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects.

"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,9954467,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2020,402913,0.025189752086670146
"Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management Project Summary / Abstract We propose to enable a scalable clinical decision support (CDS) platform that helps clinicians and patients select cancer screening strategies that are best suited to each individual. This kind of CDS is important because increased evidence supports personalizing cancer screening decisions according to each individual's unique cancer risks. While a highly desired goal, individualizing screening at a population scale requires the implementation of patient-specific risk assessments for several types of cancer. This is quite challenging in today's overwhelmed primary care environment. Our proposed CDS platform addresses this challenge by (i) automating the risk stratification process at the population level based on EHR data and patient reported data; (ii) prioritizing patients for case review by genetic counselors; and (iii) automatically communicating risk and screening recommendations with primary care providers and their patients. We will integrate the CDS platform with the Epic EHR and test it at the University of Utah Health Care community clinics and the Huntsman Cancer Institute. We will assess the generalizability of the CDS platform with a different EHR (Cerner) at a different institution (Intermountain Healthcare). To maximize the dissemination potential for the proposed cancer risk screening platform, we will extend two well-established open source CDS platforms: OpenCDS and OpenInfobutton. These platforms are reference implementations of international EHR standards that are required for EHR certification in the US. We will also obtain software certification from the Open Source EHR Alliance, share the CDS platform and our experiences with other awardees in the ITCR Program, present the CDS platform at national and international cancer and informatics conferences; and engage with relevant stakeholders through a technical expert panel. Any healthcare organization with a certified EHR will be able to use the proposed CDS platform. Therefore, if successful, this proposal can have a significant impact on disseminating individualized cancer screening practices according to the best available evidence. The proposed research addresses the need for individualizing cancer screening according to the risk of an individual. We propose to enable software that scans electronic health records of entire patient populations to automatically detect those at a high risk to develop specific types of cancer according to cancer guidelines. Genetic counselors will review patients identified by the software, and discuss optimal cancer screening strategies with the patient and their primary care providers.",Scalable Clinical Decision Support for Individualized Cancer Risk Management,9979779,U24CA204800,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Breast Cancer Risk Factor', 'Certification', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Logic', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Natural Language Processing pipeline', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Management', 'Risk stratification', 'Scanning', 'Screening for cancer', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'community clinic', 'design', 'experience', 'genetic counselor', 'health care service organization', 'healthcare community', 'high risk', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'online course', 'online resource', 'open source', 'patient population', 'personalized screening', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'web services']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2020,745481,-0.0007502007666792748
"Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the US, accounting for just under half of all diagnosed cancers (5+ million diagnoses), 27,000+ deaths each year and the annual treatment costs of over $8.1 billion. The early diagnosis of skin cancer has significant impact on patient outcomes and health care costs but remains highly subjective and requires highly specialized training while existing diagnostic devices offer low positive predictive value which results in both, missed skin cancers as well as a large number of unnecessary biopsies. When a patient presents with a suspicious skin lesion, uncertainty in the initial assessment by a dermatologist may lead to biopsies that suggest that no subsequent treatment is necessary (false positive - FP) while at the same time lesions that are not biopsied may warrant treatment (false negative - FN) potentially giving rise to claims of malpractice. FPs subject patients to unnecessary procedures and the health care system to unnecessary costs. FNs result in delayed treatment, compromising patient outcomes and increasing health care costs. This diagnostic problem is exacerbated when a patient first presents to a primary care practice due to lesser diagnostic performance. Here, some patients may be referred unnecessarily to dermatologists while other cases go undetected. The Veriskin’s TruScore device is a proprietary, non-invasive, low-cost, easy-to-use, hand-held unit that supports the diagnosis of skin cancer. It rapidly and objectively determines whether a suspicious skin lesion is cancerous, reducing the number of FNs and also reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies. The device provides a score of 0% to 100% indicating the probability of malignancy. The TruScore works by detecting and analyzing force-induced hemodynamic abnormalities due to pathological angiogenesis which is a well established early hallmark of cancer. Pilot clinical studies indicate >99% sensitivity and >94% specificity in differentiating of skin cancer from a variety of benign conditions. The device is useful at all levels of care, but the greatest benefits to patients may result when the device is used in primary care practice. The specific goal of this project is to test the device in a larger scale clinical study. The long-term goal of the project is to achieve widespread clinical adoption of this simple-to-use and low-cost non- invasive skin cancer diagnostic method and device that will (1) facilitate sensitive, specific and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin regions by general practice clinicians and nurse practitioners, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs. Project Narrative The lack of accurate, objective skin cancer assessment tool for frontline caregivers leads to preventable loss of lives and costs the US healthcare system over $8B each year.  VeriSkin device enables a low cost, non-invasive, easy-to-use skin cancer diagnostic method that will (1) facilitate accurate and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin lesions by general practice clinicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care resulting in reduction in both the number of missed skin cancers and the number of unneeded referrals to dermatologists and unnecessary biopsies, and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs.

"Quantitative Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Detection and Targeted Therapy Monitoring Platform for Ovarian Cancer Micrometastases PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  A major challenge in the management of advanced ovarian cancer is the presence of disseminated microscopic tumor nodules within the intraperitoneal cavity. Despite surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy, as many as 50% of patients can show occult disseminated disease, with only a 43% survival rate. Furthermore, systemic chemotherapy can have toxic side effects. Thus, recent efforts have aimed at improving detection and treatment of micromets. Chemophototherapy (CPT), the combination of chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy, is an emerging cancer treatment modality that can provide synergistic efficacy of both therapies. The overall goal is to implement a quantitative laparoscopic imaging and treatment approach for advanced detection of micromets and optimization of CPT for targeted destruction of ovarian micromets and reduced toxic side effects. Quantitative fluorescence laparoscopic imaging will provide high sensitivity and resolution for detecting micromets as well as image guided drug delivery. Folate receptor alpha (FA) will be used as a promising target because it is highly specific of epithelial ovarian cancer. The proposed targeted CPT compound has a ~6-fold tumor-specificity providing enhanced fluorescence contrast. These folate-targeted, porphyrin-phospholipid doped liposomes are triggered directly by near infrared (NIR) light. This activates the anti-cancer photosensitizer outer layer and releases the anti-cancer agent Doxorubicin (Dox). While this nanocarrier is expected to improve detection of micromets, tissue absorption and scattering in living tissue can confound fluorescence contrast. Quantitative imaging based on spatial frequency domain imaging can eliminate these confounding effects and provide quantitative contrasts to enable more sensitive detection compared to raw fluorescence or white light visualization. Furthermore, this quantitative capability can function in near-real-time to provide feedback on drug release, thus allowing image-guided optimization of treatment light to ensure full drug release within each tumor. In Aim 1, a wide-field dual-channel laparoscope, fast quantification algorithms and targeted liposomal nano-construct will be implemented and optimized. In Aim 2, the platform will be validated in vivo for improved detection of micromets vs. raw fluorescence and white light. In Aim 3, the platform’s efficacy will be validated in vivo for destroying micromets in targeted tumors while reducing toxicity to surrounding normal tissues. Successful completion of this approach is expected to result in improved detection and treatment of micromets with reduced side effects. This is ultimately expected to lead to reduced recurrence rates and overall improved survival. Although this imaging approach focuses on epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis and treatment, it can be applicable to a wide range of epithelial diseases, such as oral, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers. NARRATIVE A quantitative laparoscopic spatial frequency domain imaging platform is proposed to map intraperitoneal ovarian metastases as well as to treat them effectively via targeted chemo-photo therapy. Cancer-targeting drug and optimized light delivery will allow local release and preferential uptake of the drug into tumors versus normal tissue for optimal cancer cell destruction with minimal side effects to the surrounding normal tissue.

"SWOG NCORP Research Base PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The SWOG National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Research Base (RB) has established itself as an innovative, collaborative, and integral part of the NCI's publicly funded cooperative group enterprise. The overall mission of the SWOG NCORP RB is to rapidly design, activate and complete biologically-driven, scientifically important, and clinically meaningful studies in cancer prevention, control, and cancer care delivery, in adults, adolescents and young adults with or at risk for cancer, and to improve quality of life and quality of survivorship for those with malignancies. Over the last grant cycle, the SWOG NCORP RB exceeded expectations with regard to scientific productivity, rapid dissemination of results, inclusiveness, faculty and student training, administrative efficiency, novel and complex trial designs, and advancement of and incorporation of the patient voice into all aspects of our work. In particular, the SWOG NCORP RB opens high-impact trials and conducts and completes them efficiently. During the reporting period, we accrued a total of 11,470 patients, of which 9897 (86%) were placed onto SWOG-coordinated studies, and 1573 (14%) were SWOG sites enrolling onto non-SWOG studies. SWOG NCORP institutions provided 45% of the accrual (n=4451) to SWOG-coordinated studies. Our results are widely disseminated and have informed multiple practice symptom management and survivorship guidelines. We published results from a large number of studies conducted during the last two cycles (125 manuscripts; 58 abstracts), with 34% issued in journals with an impact factor > 10. Overall, 96 NCORP site members were represented as authors in 54 NCORP manuscripts and abstracts. Over the next grant cycle, we will continue to expand our administrative and data infrastructure, with initiatives addressing patient reported outcomes, a robust and modern data management and patient reported outcomes core, enhanced engagement with community investigators and non-traditional partners, augmented education and involvement of patient advocates, and new quality initiatives. We will expand our research efforts in healthcare disparities across all committees, and we will collaboratively design, conduct, and accrue to novel and practice changing studies, in order to reduce the burden of cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE The overall mission of the SWOG National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program Research Base is to rapidly design, activate and complete biologically-driven, scientifically important, and clinically meaningful studies in cancer prevention, control and cancer care delivery in adults, adolescents and young adults with or at risk for cancer, and to improve quality of life and quality of survivorship for those with malignancies.",SWOG NCORP Research Base,10001445,UG1CA189974,"['Address', 'Administrative Efficiency', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Advocate', 'Basic Science', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Control Research Program', 'Cancer Research Network', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Information Dissemination', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Oncologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Safety', 'Secure', 'Site', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational trial', 'Voice', 'Work', 'academic program', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'care delivery', 'data infrastructure', 'data management', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'expectation', 'experience', 'faculty community', 'global health', 'health care disparity', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'operation', 'organizational structure', 'programs', 'social media', 'software systems', 'student training', 'survivorship', 'symptom management', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'translational medicine', 'treatment risk', 'trial design', 'underserved minority', 'uptake', 'virtual', 'young adult']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,UG1,2020,6470524,0.05007978735470771
"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,9940707,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,450262,0.08319136063746524
"GenePattern and GenePattern Notebook: Integrative 'Omic Analysis for Cancer Research Project Summary Over the past two decades, the landscape of cancer research has changed with the explosion of publicly available and investigator generated datasets from evolving technology platforms, and the growing number of sophisticated computational methods and tools to integrate and analyze them. To move the cancer research agenda forward, the cancer research community needs a way to easily combine the right tools and methods to analyze and visualize all the data relevant to their studies, and reproducibly capture the history of what they have done. These objectives may be especially daunting for cancer biologists who don’t program. The GenePattern computational genomics environment has served cancer investigators since 2004 and was enhanced by GenePattern Notebook, released in 2017. The goal of this proposal is to continue to support, expand, and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem. Through these efforts we will continue to support a diverse community of users at the forefront of cancer research who seek to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease, translate improved methods for patient diagnosis and prognosis to the clinic, and identify new drug targets. Aim 1. Ensure the GenePattern ecosystem continues to keep pace with new and emerging methods and technologies and the changing cancer research environment. To increase the range of methods and approaches available to the GenePattern community, we will provide seamless access to other popular ‘omic analysis packages (Cytoscape, Galaxy, IGV) within GenePattern Notebook, allowing the interleaving of methods from multiple packages within the same executable notebook. We will also provide support for querying and accessing data hosted on selected cancer-relevant data repositories. Aim 2. Continue to author and serve GenePattern notebooks for the cancer research community. We will develop 30-50 new high utility notebooks for the GenePattern-Notebook Workspace, leveraging Aim 1 as required, that provide users with guided, step-by-step execution of their integrative analysis. These will comprise data processing and analysis workflows, including approaches that bridge the gap from discovery to translation. Aim 3. Extend, maintain, and support the GenePattern ecosystem infrastructure. We will continue to support and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem, including enabling hosting on multiple cloud architectures and high- performance compute sites, and enhancing the Notebook user interface with high-value features. Aim 4. Provide outreach, training, and support to our user community. We will engage the cancer research community to continue to address their needs. A Scientific Advisory Board of cancer biologists and physician scientists will review progress and guide our strategy as we proceed. We will continue our high level of support and outreach for GenePattern and its notebook environment, including cancer-focused tutorials and training materials, in-person workshops, conference presentations, webinars, and social media vehicles and our responsive forum. We will fully participate in all of the ITCR program activities. Relevance GenePattern is a popular bioinformatics software ecosystem that puts sophisticated computational methods within the reach of all biomedical researchers to address a variety of problems at the forefront of cancer research, including patient diagnosis and prognosis, identification of new drug targets, and understanding disease mechanisms. We will continue to support and enhance the system by providing interoperable access to additional software tools and data resources from GenePattern Notebook, a beginning-to-end computational electronic lab notebook environment for combining analysis and text.

"Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Title: Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Abstract Cancer is a complex disease in which genetic disruptions in cell signaling networks are known to play a significant role. A major aim of cancer systems biology is to build models that can predict the impact of these genetic disruptions to guide therapeutic interventions (i.e. personalized medicine). A prominent driver of cancer cell growth is signaling pathway deregulation from mutations in key regulatory nodes and loss/gain in gene copy number (CNV). However, current mathematical modeling approaches do not adequately capture the impact of these genetic changes. Reasons for this include the poorly understood layers of regulation between gene expression and protein activity, and limitations in most modeling and protein measurement technologies. In addition, there is a paucity of overarching hypotheses that can link specific gene expression or mutation patterns to the cancer phenotype. Recent work by our group has resolved some of the technical challenges that have hindered the application of proteomics technologies to cancer systems biology research. It has also suggested a new approach for using quantitative proteomics data to understand mechanisms driving cancer cell behavior. Using an ultrasensitive, targeted proteomics platform that can measure both abundance and phosphorylation of proteins present at only hundreds of copies per cell, we found that signaling pathways appeared to be controlled by only a limited number of key nodes whose activity is tightly regulated through low abundance and feedback phosphorylation. We propose to build on these findings by critically testing the hypothesis that CNV and genetic mutations dysregulate signaling pathways in cancer by shifting control from tightly regulated nodes to poorly regulated ones. This will be done by systematically identifying key regulatory nodes of normal and cancer cells using CRISPRa/i screens, determine the relationship between protein abundance and signaling pathway activities using ultrasensitive targeted proteomics and phosphoproteomics and then use these data to semi-automatically generate mathematical models of the functional topology of the signaling pathways. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Use targeted CRISPR gene perturbation libraries to identify the regulatory topologies of signaling pathways important in cancer and how they are disrupted by common cancer mutations, 2) Use the CRISPR perturbation and proteomics data to semi-automatically build predictive models of cancer cell signaling pathways, and 3) Combine modeling and perturbation screens to understand how feedback regulation in cancer contributes to drug resistance. This work will result in simplified, computationally tractable yet mechanistic models of signaling pathways and provide network maps of feedback and crosstalk circuits that can be used to rapidly map the regulatory state of cells. Most important, it will provide a generic platform for translating protein abundance and phosphorylation patterns into a “state” snapshot of cancers that can lead to predicting their response to specific drugs. Narrative Cancer is an extremely complex disease which is frequently caused by signaling pathway deregulation from genetic mutation or loss/gain in gene copy number. Modern analytical techniques have provided a wealth of data on the molecular changes associated with cancer mutations, but it has been extremely difficult to use this information to design targeted therapies. We propose a new methodology that combines CRISPR-based targeted screens, advanced proteomics technologies, and a new mathematical modeling approach for identifying proteomics signatures of altered signaling pathways in cancer that can be used to build predictive models and explore mechanisms of drug resistance.",Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer,9923630,U01CA227544,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'CRISPR library', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Feedback', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Play', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'cell behavior', 'design', 'experimental study', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2020,715682,0.06327501294288689
"Cancer Deep Phenotype Extraction from Electronic Medical Records Summary Precise phenotype information is needed to advance translational cancer research, particularly to unravel the effects of genetic, epigenetic, and systems changes on tumor behavior and responsiveness. Examples of phenotypic variables in cancer include: tumor morphology (e.g. histopathologic diagnosis), co-morbid conditions (e.g. associated immune disease), laboratory findings (e.g. gene amplification status), specific tumor behaviors (e.g. metastasis) and response to treatment (e.g. effect of a chemotherapeutic agent on tumor). Current models for correlating EMR data with –omics data largely ignore the clinical text, which remains one of the most important sources of phenotype information for cancer patients. Unlocking the value of clinical text has the potential to enable new insights about cancer initiation, progression, metastasis, and response to treatment. We propose further collaboration to enhance the DeepPhe platform with new methods for cancer deep phenotyping. Several aims propose investigation of biomedical information extraction where there has been little or no previous work (e.g. clinical genomic). Visualization of extracted data, usability of the software, and dissemination are also emphasized. A diverse set of oncology studies led by accomplished translational investigators in Breast Cancer, Melanoma, Ovarian Cancer, Colorectal Cancer and Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma will demonstrate the utility of the software. These labs will contribute phenotype variables for extraction, test utility and usability of the software, and provide the setting for an extrinsic evaluation. The proposed research bridges novel methods to automate cancer deep phenotype extraction from clinical text with emerging standards in phenotype knowledge representation and NLP. This work is highly aligned with recent calls in the scientific literature to advance scalable and robust methods of extracting and representing phenotypes for precision medicine and translational research. Relevance We propose research to enhance the ability of researchers to utilize data from unstructured medical records in their translational cancer research programs.

"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",9964674,U54CA209988,"['3-Dimensional', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational Materials', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MDA-MB-468', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Resistance', 'SDZ RAD', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'analytical tool', 'bioimaging', 'bioprinting', 'cancer cell', 'combinatorial', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data management', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2020,2053370,0.02621258926876714
"Deciphering Clonal Evolution in Hereditary Renal Cell Carcinomas 1 Background: An improved understanding of the factors that drive cancer growth and progression is  2 fundamental for improving outcomes in patients with cancer. Individuals with Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)  3 disease develop multiple vascular tumours in their lifetime including many hundreds of malignant  4 cysts and clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCCs). These tumours are the genomic mirror image of  5 sporadic ccRCCs and display variable clinical phenotypes. Profiling multiple, independent tumours  6 that have arisen in an identical germline and host environment offers an intrinsically controlled model  7 to study the factors underlying cancer evolution and progression in general. We will leverage the  8 unique clinical cohort of patients with VHL Disease at the Clinical Centre to study how the molecular  9 landscape (Objective 1), the tumour microenvironment (TME) (Objective 2) and the metabolome 10 (Objective 3) promote or restrain cancer growth. 11 Methods: Subjects will be recruited to this prospective cohort study from the Urology Oncology 12 Branch at the National Cancer Institute. Growth kinetics of individual tumours will be tracked 13 radiologically. During procurement, tumours are identified and correlated with imaging. We will 14 perform multiparametric molecular profiling, integrating all datasets to achieve our study objectives. 15 Using next generation sequencing we will characterise the events that underlie malignant 16 transformation (Objective 1.1) and the molecular events associated with differential growth kinetics 17 (Objective 1.1). We will explore events associated with tumour fromation in extra-renal sites 18 (Objective 1.3) and how molecular/environmental variants influence variable phenotypic penetration 19 amongst VHL kindred (Objective 1.4). To assess the role of the TME, we will use genomic profiling to 20 assess the neoantigen landscape (Objective 2.1) and identify differential immune cell lineages using 21 RNA sequencing (Objective 2.2). We will validate these fidnings with multiplex immunohistochemistry 22 (IHC) approach. We will assess the perturbed metabolome utilising transcriptome profiling (Objective 23 3.1) and conduct a pilot study to assess genomic and transcriptomic changes with stable isotope- 24 resolved metabolic profiles obtained from VHL tumor tissue obtained intraoperatively. 25 Conclusion: This will be the most comprehensive molecular profiling of cancers arising in VHL 26 disease. It has the potential to address key questions regarding evolutionary cancer biology and to 27 identify the triggers for tumour growth and progression and hence predictive or prognostic biomarkers 28 which may have a wider relevance to cancer. It may inform novel therapeutic strategies for the 29 treatment and prevention of hereditary and sporadic ccRCC. This translational prospective cohort study of patients with multiple tumours arising on a background of germline VHL mutation aims to comprehensively characterise and understand the molecular events associated with growth and progression of clear cell renal cancer and other VHL associated cancers. We will employ multiparametric tumour profiling to assess how the molecular landscape, the tumour microenvironment and metabolic reprogramming contribute to differences in tumour behaviour. Outputs from this research have the potential to address key question in evolutionary cancer biology: the concept of evolutionary contingency; and in parallel, to identify the triggers for tumour growth and progression, and potentially revealing therapeutic vulnerabilities.",Deciphering Clonal Evolution in Hereditary Renal Cell Carcinomas,9916258,U01CA247439,"['Address', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Clear Cell', 'Clear cell renal cell carcinoma', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Cyst', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Hereditary Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Inherited', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Microtomy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Neoplasms in Vascular Tissue', 'Oncology', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Urology', 'VHL mutation', 'Variant', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome', 'Work', 'anaerobic glycolysis', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer prevention', 'clinical center', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'kindred', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'multidimensional data', 'neoantigens', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'progression marker', 'recruit', 'stable isotope', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,"FRANCIS CRICK INSTITUTE, LTD",U01,2020,317425,0.04259882533506302
"Proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma Project Summary  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and therapeutic options are limited. There is a pressing need to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease in order to identify new effective biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC. Proteins are the functional molecules of the cell, and many clinically validated biomarkers and most drug targets are proteins; however, cancer omics studies have relied primarily on genomic platforms. By melding genomics with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the new field of proteogenomics provides an opportunity to more completely understand how somatic genomes activate aberrant protein networks that drive cancer pathogenesis. A major National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded initiative, the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the more recently established International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC), are promoting an integrated proteogenomics approach that is postulated to produce sounder therapeutic hypotheses and a new generation of protein biomarkers. The central purpose of this application is to forge a collaboration between a CPTAC team in the US and an ICPC team in China to enable proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discoveries in hepatitis B virus-related (HBV+) HCC, which attributes to 85% of HCC cases in China. The two teams bring complementary expertise required for a successful proteogenomic study of HCC. The China team has already generated the most comprehensive multi-omics dataset yet produced for liver cancer by applying proteogenomic profiling to a Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort (CHCC-HBV) with 159 cases, and the data has been preliminarily analyzed through collaborative efforts between the two teams. In this application, the US team will perform deep computational analyses of the proteogenomics data to generate prognostic models and therapeutic hypotheses, which will be experimentally validated in cell lines, animal models, and clinical specimens by the China team. Our specific Aims are: Aim 1) To develop and validate a protein-based prognostic model; Aim 2) To identify and validate subtype-specific causal drivers and therapeutic strategies; and Aim 3) To characterize the immune landscape of HBV+ HCC. Successful completion of this project will lead to new knowledge on HCC biology as well as new prognostic and treatment strategies for HBV+ HCC. Meanwhile, experimentally validated computational methods developed in this project will have wide application to the study of other cancers and other non-cancer diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV+ HCC) attributes to 85% of all HCC cases in China, and therapeutic options are limited. This project will forge a collaboration between a computational team in the US and an HCC oncology team in China to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of a large Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort using the new proteogenomic approach that systematically integrates genomics and mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. This collaborative project will produce new biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC as well as experimentally validated computational methods that can be broadly applied to proteogenomic studies in other cancer types and other diseases.",Proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma,9879361,R01CA245903,"['Animal Model', 'Antigens', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Hepatitis B Virus', 'Immune', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'RNA analysis', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Specimen', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Xenograft Model', 'base', 'biomarker selection', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'genomic platform', 'immunogenicity', 'in silico', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'neoantigens', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'protein biomarkers', 'proteogenomics', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,204000,0.042136068032743175
"The Mechanism of SOX6 in Ewing Sarcoma Metastasis Project Summary Current survival rates of pediatric cancers like leukemia have seen drastic positive response in survival and treatment in the last 20 years. In stark contrast, patients with solid tumor metastasis challenge the current paradigm of intense chemotherapy treatment. Such treatments have failed to change the poor prognosis of metastatic disease indicating a need to understand the complex underpinnings of the in vivo metastatic microenvironment. This need for understanding is enhanced in pediatric patients, where metastasis is promoted by access to a large pool of undifferentiated cells. This project addresses this critical issue in Ewing sarcoma, a cancer that codifies the challenges and shortcomings of current cancer therapeutics. Ewing sarcoma is a malignant cancer of bone and soft tissue targeting children, adolescents and young adults. Overall survival rates for Ewing sarcoma patients with metastasis is abysmal at less than 20% for those with advanced disease and at 60% for those with localized tumors. One in three patients with Ewing sarcoma will have presentation of metastasis. These metrics demonstrate the desperate need to further understand the genesis of metastasis in vivo. This proposal focuses in on the role of the transcription factor SOX6 and its role in Ewing sarcoma metastasis. My preliminary zebrafish xenograft data show a clear, marked increase in metastasis with normal levels of SOX6, while SOX6 shRNA knockdown cells have less or no metastatic spread from injection site. My SOX6 knockdown proteome data show suppression of CAV1, a known gene targeting E-cadherin expression in Ewing sarcoma and increase of BCL2A1, an established anti-apoptotic protein involved in numerous cancer cells. This project’s central hypothesis is: 1) SOX6 mediated protein changes cause an increase in motility and decrease in apoptosis leading to metastasis and 2) that upon metastasis, interaction with the microenvironmental niche triggers invasive proliferative phenotypes mediated by downstream targets of SOX6. These SOX6-mdediated phenotype and proteomic changes support a story of in vivo initiation and persistence of metastatic lesions in Ewing sarcoma. This proposal is the first to look at the intersection of the cell microenvironment with SOX6 to show a new pathway for advancing momentum to targeted treatment of metastasis. Using my unique background in engineering and my training in cell biology, I propose a method that remediates key failures of current treatment by understanding the initiation of metastasis in vivo, persistence of cancer cells, and microenvironmental effects fostering metastasis. This proposal unites many disciplines to offer scientific impact on the genesis of metastasis and provides an incredible opportunity to train my skills as a future independent investigator. Project Narrative: Many metastatic models of cancer fail to account for the complexity of the tumor microenvironment at the metastatic niche, and the zebrafish provides a readily imageable model to analyze human cancer metastasis using machine learning. This project looks at the in vivo role of the transcription factor SOX6 in metastatic progression of Ewing sarcoma through cell proliferation, motility change, and apoptosis suppression. Further understanding and characterization of SOX6 will provide a new pathway for understanding metastatic progression, commonly associated with poor prognosis, in human Ewing sarcoma patients.",The Mechanism of SOX6 in Ewing Sarcoma Metastasis,10017658,F31CA236410,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Biosensor', 'Bone Tissue', 'CAV1 gene', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Child', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collagen', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-Cadherin', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Failure', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'In Vitro', 'Injections', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Bone Neoplasm', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'SOX6 gene', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Zebrafish', 'advanced disease', 'cancer cell', 'cell motility', 'chemotherapy', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'leukemia', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'response', 'skills', 'small hairpin RNA', 'soft tissue', 'targeted imaging', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,F31,2020,34014,0.043421748708261834
"Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers PROJECT SUMMARY As a computational biologist, my long-term goal is to develop methods and tools to discover new or better therapeutics for cancers. In the past few years, I have identified drug-repositioning candidates for a number of primary cancers using Big Data approaches. These candidates have been validated successfully in preclinical mouse models. To maximize the utility of Big Data, I plan to translate the findings into therapeutics; therefore, I propose to develop methods to utilize transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers. Current preclinical and clinical approaches including the NCI MATCH trial select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations, yet patients may have no actionable mutations or multiple actionable mutations that are hard to prioritize, suggesting the need for other different types of molecular biomarkers. The recent efforts have enabled the large-scale identification of various types of molecular biomarkers through correlating drug sensitivity with molecular profiles of pre-treatment cancer cell lines. Computational methods to match these biomarkers to individual patients to inform therapy in the clinic are thus in high demand. The objective of this award is therefore to develop computational approaches to identify therapeutics for individual patients by leveraging large-scale biomarkers identified from cancer cell lines. Through conducing this research, I expect to expand my knowledge in cancer clinical trials, cancer genomics, cancer biology, and statistics. To achieve the goal, I have gathered seven renowned experts from different fields related to Big Data Science as mentors/advisors/collaborators: Primary Mentor Dr. Atul Butte in translational bioinformatics from UCSF, Co-mentor Dr. Samuel So in cancer biology from Stanford University, Co-mentor Dr. Mark Segal in statistics from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Andrei Goga in cancer biology from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Laura Esserman in breast cancer trials from UCSF, Collaborator Dr. John Gordan in liver cancer trials from UCSF and Collaborator Dr. Xin Chen in cancer biology from UCSF. With the support from my world- class mentors, advisors and collaborators, this award will prepare me to be a leader in developing big data methods that are broadly impactful. PROJECT NARRATIVE One goal of the precision medicine initiative is to select optimal therapies for individual cancer patients based on their molecular and clinical profiles. Current preclinical and clinical approaches select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations. This work is expected to employ the protein/gene expression based biomarkers computed from public databases to inform individualized cancer therapy.","Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers",9925076,K01ES028047,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Award', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Non-Malignant', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'big-data science', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'data sharing', 'drug candidate', 'drug efficacy', 'drug sensitivity', 'efficacy testing', 'genetic signature', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning classifier', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'oncotype', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'protein expression', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,169087,0.05114630385058626
"Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ABSTRACT  The principle investigator, Dr. Travis Schrank, MD, PhD, is a first-year faculty member in the University of North Carolina Department of Otolaryngology. He has been hired in a surgeon-scientist role and presently has 75% protected time for research. His past training in computational biophysics and experimental biochemistry have motivated and equipped him pursue an independent research career in computational genomics and head and neck cancer molecular biology. The presented research aims are an outgrowth of the PI's ongoing efforts to improve RNA based methods for identifying NRF2 active head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors.  NRF2 is the key transcriptional regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, and has been related to poor patient outcome and radiation response in multiple cancer types. Mutational activation of NRF2 is observed in 8% of HPV negative (HPV-) HNSCC. However, our estimates based on RNA transcription suggest that NRF2 is aberrantly activated in 24% of HPV- HNSCC. This work has identified atypical NRF2 and CUL3 variants which are associated with NRF2 activation. The functional consequences of these variants will be investigated (Aim 1). We also find that the prohormone Neurotensin is highly expressed in NRF2 active HNSCC tumors without NRF2 pathway mutations. Our preliminary data suggest that pro-Neurotensin may activate NRF2, through a previously unreported interaction with KEAP1 (a regulator of NRF2 stability). This novel function of pro-Neurotensin will be investigated in Aim 2. Suppression of NRF2 activity is well known to radio-sensitize cancer cells. We have also identified a partially suppressed pattern of NRF2 target expression in HPV associated (HPV+) HNSCC tumors, which are highly sensitive to radiation. p14ARF is also highly expressed in HPV+ HNSCC, binds NRF2, and suppresses transactivation of some NRF2 targets. Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that NRF2 target suppression due to high levels of p14ARF, contributes to the radio-sensitivity of these tumors.  The proposed work will be impactful for several reasons, 1) the tumor subclassification method developed address the very common problem of imperfect clinical/genomic annotations of tumor RNA expression data, 2) the first known/reported signaling role for the prohormone form of Neurotensin will be explored, and 3) identification of NRF2 targets associated with radiation response may suggest novel approaches to treatment.  UNC has exceptionally strong institutional expertise and resources related to cancer genomics. The mentorship committee also has key project specific expertise in NRF2 biology, computational genomics, p14ARF and Neurotensin. Collectively the mentorship team has previously trained four K award recipients and includes two surgeon-scientists who can provide critical career guidance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aberrant activation of the transcription factor NRF2, a key regulator of the cellular oxidative stress response, is frequently seen in HPV negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and is associated with a poor prognosis. Functionally validated somatic mutations of this pathway can only account for 30% of the observed activation. The objective of this proposal is to identify and characterize novel genomic and proteomic mechanisms of NRF2 activation in order to advance strategies for the diagnosis and targeted treatment of patients with NRF2 active tumors.",Mechanisms Determining Dysregulation of the NRF2 Oxidative Stress Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma,10126595,K08DE029241,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'CDKN2A gene', 'CUL3 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Faculty', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'MDM2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Mediating', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Neurotensin', 'Neurotensin Receptors', 'North Carolina', 'Otolaryngology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Primary Carcinoma', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiosensitization', 'Reading Frames', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Surgeon', 'TP53 gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transactivation', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'autocrine', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'genetic signature', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oral HPV-positive head and neck cancers', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'prohormone', 'proneurotensin', 'radiation resistance', 'radiation response', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational genomics', 'treatment risk', 'tumor']",NIDCR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K08,2020,173993,0.01998420941969965
"Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface Project Summary/Abstract  Cancer has long been described as a disease of the human genome, and the past two decades of research have largely focused on characterizing the molecular mechanisms that contribute to its origin, progression, and treatment resistance.1,2,28–30 Over the past year, a series of seminal studies have identified significant non-human, microbial contributions in the development and advancement of solid tumors, hematologic malignancies, and germline cancer syndromes, as well as the variable efficacy of chemo- and immunotherapy, shedding light on what may be considered cancer’s ‘second’ genome (the metagenome).3–11,25 The extent of these microbial contributions across diverse cancer types in the human body and their implications on broader clinical management, however, remain largely unknown.12 Answering basic questions regarding the presence and specificity of such microbes in certain cancer types and cancer stages could guide the rational design of new, microbially-based diagnostics, prognostics, and therapies. Further, addressing more complex questions regarding the interactions of these microbes with cancer and host immune cells in the tumor microenvironment could provide critical insight into the design of personalized immunotherapy, cancer vaccines, and cancer risk profiles, hopefully leading to improved patient outcomes.  This proposal builds on a recent analysis of the cancer microbiome in 14,038 primary tumors, through which I have shown that virtually every major tumor type in the human body carries a unique, discriminative microbial signature. Inspired by recent evidence that highlights the role of pathogen-centric immunobiology in cancer development16,17 and the ability of microbes to powerfully modulate the systemic and local immune systems,5,6,8,18 I now hypothesize that the broad existence of these cancer microbes provides an evolutionary advantage for tumors to escape the host immune system’s recognition and response. I also hypothesize that the same immunological processes that are known to shape cancer’s mutational and phenotypic landscapes are concurrently shaping the tumor microbiota. Armed with patient germline HLA allele data and inferred immune cell abundances in the same primary tumors as those in our cancer microbiome study, I believe these hypotheses are finally testable. Aim 1 of this project seeks to investigate them alongside immunotherapy response data.21,22 Complementarily, Aim 2 seeks to define the intratumoral spatial distribution of the cancer microbiome and associated immune cells using a combination of computational and wet lab analyses. These results will contribute to our foundational knowledge on what is becoming the immuno-oncology-microbiome (IOM) axis.  The proposed interdisciplinary research will take place at UC San Diego in collaboration with microbiome, systems biology, tumor immunology, pathology, and oncology experts, who serve as mentors and advisors to me. Through their invaluable mentorship, hands-on learning, networking, and additional graduate coursework, I will grow into the translational and effective physician-scientist I so desire to be. Project Narrative The long-held view that cancer is a “sterile” entity is starting to change. New evidence suggests that intratumoral microbes can affect the development, progression, and treatment resistance of solid tumors. My preliminary findings suggest that unique microbial signatures exist for every major tumor type in the human body, and this proposal extends that work to characterize the interfaces between these cancer microbes, cancer cells, and the host immune system.",Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface,9911763,F30CA243480,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Alleles', 'Binding', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future Generations', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer cell', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'design', 'digital', 'enteric infection', 'genome sequencing', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hands-on learning', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning network', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'pathogen', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prognostic', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microbiota', 'tumor microenvironment', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2020,37593,0.0286645334499323
"Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach Project Summary/Abstract This proposal will generate evidence to reduce the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States. Overdiagnosis is the identification of a disease that, had it not been detected, would be unlikely to cause symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime. Overdiagnosis has significant consequences, such as overtreatment with associated side effects and complications, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs. Despite a three-fold increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses since the late 1980s, the mortality rate remains stable. Small papillary thyroid cancers, which are rarely lethal, are responsible for virtually the entire increase in incidence. However, it is not safe to assume that all small thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed; some small thyroid cancers can be aggressive and do need treatment. Effective methods are urgently needed to understand the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, so that directed solutions can be developed and implemented to reduce overdiagnosis. We propose the innovative use of systems engineering and simulation modeling to address this knowledge gap and provide a nuanced understanding of the natural history of thyroid tumors. We will use our model to identify the effect of reducing referrals for and use of thyroid imaging on overdiagnosis; the effect of changing the size threshold for biopsy on overdiagnosis; and the downstream impact of reducing overdiagnosis on harms and benefits of treatment. This approach also accounts for differential use and improved precision of ultrasound over time. Our goal is to create and validate a simulation model that quantifies overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer. We will engage stakeholders at all stages of development, from model conception to validation, to elicit clinical guidance and inform our model inputs, outcomes, and dissemination strategies. Our research team comprises an industrial-systems engineer with expertise in cancer modeling, as well as experts in thyroid cancer, cancer epidemiology, health services research, and communication. The multidisciplinary team is highly qualified to complete the three specific aims: (1) Develop and validate a simulation model to quantify overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the US; (2) Identify healthcare utilization patterns (e.g., provider encounters and referral decisions) that expose patients to increased thyroid imaging, biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer; (3) Engage key stakeholders throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the model has face validity, and that the output can be applied to questions important to both clinicians and policy makers. The proposed research aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s mission to help people live longer and healthier lives. Results from this innovative model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care, while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is a significant problem that compromises patients’ quality of life, leading to overtreatment, exposure to unnecessary risk, and high medical costs. The objective of this research is to identify factors that predispose people to being diagnosed with thyroid cancer that would never cause symptoms or death if undetected, so the healthcare system can instead focus resources on thyroid cancers that would result in morbidity if untreated. Results of the model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment.",Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach,10031384,R01CA251566,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Model', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural History', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Papillary thyroid carcinoma', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policy Maker', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Withholding Treatment', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer site', 'clinically relevant', 'follow-up', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'side effect', 'thyroid neoplasm', 'tumor growth', 'virtual', 'virtual laboratory']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,580599,0.054118814499138114
"Proteomic Analysis of Blood Plasma using High Throughput Sequencers Abstract  Aptamers made from DNA, RNA and other nucleic acids that have chemical modifications can be engineered to bind tightly to biomolecules like the proteins that circulate in blood.  The primary goal of this project is to develop a kit of aptamer reagents to enable simultaneous measurement of protein abundance profiles, focusing especially on significant differentially abundant proteins in blood. This will aid in cancer diagnostics and in monitoring protein populations over the course of disease and therapeutic intervention. The intended product is an Aptamer Proteomics kit (AP-kit) that can be used by researchers and clinicians to comprehensively profile the differences between healthy individuals and those afflicted with cancer. The kits will be validated in-house and tested with carefully curated samples focused on prostate cancer.  The AP-kits will give cancer scientists new tools that lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of cancer types and to create new and more effective treatments and preventions. Physicians will be enabled to diagnose tumors earlier, reducing the burden of radiation treatments and chemotherapy on cancer patients. AP-assays will aid in monitoring the progress of cancer therapies and allow treatments to be customized for individual patients.

"Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome SUMMARY: There is an increased need for predictive and prognostic assays to distinguish more and less aggressive phenotypes of cancer due to A) dramatic increase in cancer incidence and; B) improvements in early diagnosis. Predictive assays in particular will allow for patients with less aggressive disease to be spared more aggressive treatment. Most prognostic tests in the US and Europe are based on gene expression assays (e.g. Oncotype DX (ODx)). Recent studies have shown extensive genetic heterogeneity among cancer cells between tumors and even within the same tumor, suggesting that approaches for recommending therapy for a patient based on the “average” molecular signal of many cells are overly simplistic.  Interestingly, for a number of cancers, tumor grade (morphologic appearance on tissue as assessed qualitatively or semi-quantitatively by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome. However pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Digitzation of histological samples, or whole slide imaging, facilitates a quantitative approach towards evaluating disease progression and predicting outcome, while also facilitating the adoption of telepathology. Recently, research groups (including our own) have begun to show that computer extracted measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. capturing nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from routine H&E stained cancer tissue images can predict disease aggressiveness and treatment outcome. By computationally interrogating the entire tumor landscape and its most invasive elements from a standard H&E slide, these approaches can allow for more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity, disease risk and hence the most appropriate treatment strategy.  The goal of this academic-industrial partnership is to develop and validate a computerized histologic image-based predictor (CHIP) to identify which early-stage, estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer patients are candidates for hormonal therapy alone and which women are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy based off analysis of the pathology slides derived from biopsy and surgical specimens. Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company which has recently licensed a number of histomorphometry based technologies from the Madabhushi group, will bring quality management systems and production software standards to help create a pre-commercial companion diagnostic test of the CHIP assay. Additionally Inspirata Inc. will build a complete regulatory pathway for successful translation of the assay in the US and abroad. Finally, the pre-commercial prototype of the CHIP assay will be independently validated using the same strategy and data cohorts as ODx. Our approach has several advantages over molecular assays such as ODx in that it (1) can interrogate the entire expanse of the pathology image enabling a more accurate capture of tumor heterogeneity and hence disease risk, (2) is non-disruptive of pathology workflow, (3) non-destructive of tissue and would be substantially (4) cheaper (critical in low to middle income countries) and (5) faster. RELEVANCE: Of the 1 million women worldwide who in 2015 will be diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer, most will be treated with chemotherapy, though only a small number (< 20%) will benefit from it. Our goal is to create and validate a pre-commercial prototype of a computerized histologic image based predictor (CHIP) for identifying which early stage ER+ breast cancer patients will benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. CHIP will employ sophisticated computer vision techniques for comprehensive characterization of disease morphology from digitized images of H&E stained specimens yielding a continuous image-based risk score; low CHIP risk score suggesting hormonal therapy is sufficient while adjuvant chemo is required for high CHIP score patients.",Computerized histologic image predictor of cancer outcome,9951006,R01CA202752,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Europe', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head Cancer', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Industrialization', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Joints', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Positive Lymph Node', 'Production', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Recurrence', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Sum', 'System', 'Tamoxifen', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telepathology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Biology', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'cancer cell', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'hormone therapy', 'imaging biomarker', 'industry partner', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'oncotype', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'predictive test', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'response', 'translation assay', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,598709,-0.03455432660644354
"Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer ABSTRACT There is an unmet need for novel approaches to cancer research, including improved model systems. Pet dogs are among the most promising natural models for translational cancer research​. They share our environment and develop cancers with clear clinical, histological, and genomic similarities to human cancer. We propose to use new genomic technology and a direct-to-dog-owner approach to overcome existing limitations of the canine model. To accomplish this, we will use new liquid biopsy technology, which makes it possible to sequence ​tumor exomes in circulating cell-free DNA from a blood sample, and thus achieve deeper understanding of tumor genomics without invasive biopsies. The power of these minimally invasive sampling technologies is greatest in application to very large sets of clinical samples. Family dogs, whose environments are shared with humans and for which tumor genomics are similar to human cancers, offer an unparalleled model in which to assemble clinical sets of size sufficient both to confirm the relevance of known genetic pathways, and to identify new ones. We propose to combine the power of cell-free DNA sequencing, ​the enthusiasm of citizen-scientist pet owners, and the clinical experience of veterinarians. We will create a research portal for collection of information on diagnosis, treatment, and outcome for thousands of dogs with cancer, as well as their environment and lifestyle. W​e will also develop new computational methodologies to identify genomic similarities between canine and human cancers. Comparison of these canine and human mutational profiles will enable matching of canine cancer subtypes with human cancer subtypes based on genetic pathways, facilitating canine trials to advance human clinical studies. We aim to:  Aim 1. ​Develop software to Identify canine models for human cancers using genomic data and  comprehensive, histology-blind analysis approach.  Aim 2. Develop and optimize ​cell-free DNA sampling and sequencing methods in dogs, including  ultra-low-pass whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing.  Aim 3. Implement a ​direct-to-dog-owner smartphone app to collect and validate detailed clinical, and  environmental data, paired with blood samples, for thousands of dogs. By combining the power of genome sequencing and new liquid biopsy technology with the opportunity to collect large sets of samples from a species whose cancers are genomically reflective of those in humans, our project​ will​ transform​ the scale and scope of translational cancer research and precision medicine. Project Narrative Pet dogs live in the same environments that we do, suggesting that profiling mutations in dog tumors could guide treatment of human cancers. With the help of veterinarians and citizen-scientist dog owners, we will build tools and resources needed to study cancer in thousands of dogs at once. This will help scientists find important genetic features of canine cancers, match them to specific human cancers, and translate what we learn into new cancer therapeutics.",Transforming family dogs into a powerful and accessible model for human cancer,9891974,R37CA218570,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Models', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Canis familiaris', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dog family', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Inherited', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Silicones', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Veterinarians', 'analysis pipeline', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'blind', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer subtypes', 'cell free DNA', 'chemotherapy', 'citizen science', 'classifier algorithm', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'human data', 'human model', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational cancer research', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'whole genome']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R37,2020,653673,0.06462926744967369
"Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most frequent tumors in men. Despite recent progress, the disease is still incurable once resistance to castration therapy occurs. Tumor progression is strongly mediated by altered molecular exchanges between cancer cells and the surrounding milieu that originate at the primary sites. However, the mechanisms regulating the response of the stroma to the tumor, which ultimately promote PC progression are still largely unknown. Our laboratory discovered a new type of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle (EV), which are referred to as “large oncosomes” (LO), can harbor more abundant molecular cargo that is distinct and more potently bioactive than that carried by exosomes. The rationale for this proposal derives from our preliminary observations in patients that LO abundance in the circulation correlates with PC progression. Our functional data demonstrate that LO can activate oncogenic signaling in fibroblasts, which respond to LO uptake by activating MYC and SPI1 and by induce a transcriptional program that promotes angiogenesis and stimulates tumor growth. The overarching goal of this project is to determine the functional role of LO in PC progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that LO functionally reprogram normal prostate-associated fibroblasts (NAF) toward a phenotype that is driven by MYC and SPI1 activation. These results strongly suggest that tumor-derived LO might activate intercellular responses that are specific to this subtype of extracellular vesicle. Our hypothesis will be tested with three Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate the role of LO-induced fibroblast activation in PC progression. Aim 2: To find evidence that the LO- induced transcriptional program is active in PC patients with clinically significant disease. Aim 3: To test if LO and/or Exo derived from PC patient and PDX specimens promote castration resistance and/or bone metastasis. We will use a combination of complementary in vitro and animal orthotopic models as well as focused approaches involving genome editing, molecular barcodes, and a Cre-Lox reporter in vivo system. Our study will determine if the transcriptional program induced by LO in vitro drives tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. Additionally we will determine if this transcriptional program can also be identified in patient specimens and if it indicative of tumor progression. Finally, our study will provide evidence for LO abilities to induce metastasis of indolent PC cells. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this project we will perform functional tests of a newly-identified class of tumor-derived extracellular vesicle, referred to as large oncosomes. These shed vesicles are products of metastatic prostate cancer cells and we have obtained evidence that they are potent effectors of conditioning of the tumor microenvironment in a manner that promotes disease progression. Here we will examine their potential role in stroma-supported tumor progression and metastasis and the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process.",Molecular Mechanisms of Large Oncosome-Induced Prostate Cancer Progression and Metastasis,9981710,R01CA234557,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Bone Marrow', 'COL1A2 gene', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cancer Patient', 'Castration', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Cre-LoxP', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Endothelium', 'Fibroblasts', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Indolent', 'Intervention', 'Knock-out', 'Laboratories', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nonmetastatic', 'Oncogenic', 'Oncology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Reporter', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'SPI1 gene', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'androgen sensitive', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'cell stroma', 'clinically significant', 'conditioning', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome editing', 'host neoplasm interaction', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intercellular communication', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'molecular oncology', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'programs', 'prostate cancer cell', 'prostate cancer metastasis', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'response', 'trafficking', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,488621,-0.04515956140254918
"Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia The American Cancer Society estimates that 48,330 new cases of cancer in the oral cavity and pharynx will be reported this year. When diagnosed at early stages, the 5-year survival rate is 83%. However, when diagnosed at intermediate or advance stages, the 5-year survival rate drops to 62% and 38%, respectively. In addition, while early stage treatment may only require minor surgery to remove the localized tumor, later stage treatment could require surgical removal of parts of the face and neck, hence drastically reducing the patient’s quality of life. Unfortunately, benign oral lesions are sometimes difficult to distinguish from dysplasia or early invasive cancer even for healthcare professionals. As a result, only 31% of patients are diagnosed at early stages despite the fact that the oral cavity is easily accessible for direct examination. Hence, there is a critical need for new clinical technologies for reliable early diagnosis of oral cancer and dysplasia. Several screening tools for oral cancer have been commercially available, including exfoliative cytology, vital staining, salivary test, and optical interrogation; however, none of them have been demonstrated to be capable of clinically relevant sensitivity and specificity. We hypothesize that several biomarkers for oral cancer and dysplasia can be accurately quantified by endogenous fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) thus enabling levels of sensitivity and specificity adequate for early detection. This bioengineering research grant focuses on developing and validating a cost-effective wide-field multispectral FLIM endoscope for noninvasive in situ detection of oral cancer and dysplasia. To that end we have developed three specific aims. Aim 1: To design and build a cost-effective multispectral FLIM endoscope for in vivo imaging of epithelial tissue in the oral cavity. Aim 2: To develop algorithms for fast and automated FLIM based early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. Aim 3: To quantify prospectively in a pilot clinical study the capability of the proposed FLIM endoscopic tools for noninvasively early detection of oral epithelial cancer and dysplasia. The successful completion of these aims will result in a novel, accurate and cost-effective clinical tool for noninvasive in situ early detection of cancer and dysplasia. Such a tool could potentially help to improve significantly both the life expectancy and the quality of life for the more than 33,000 oral cancer patients being diagnosed each year at intermediate and advance stages. Beyond early diagnosis, this tool could also assist at every step involved on the clinical management of oral cancer patients, including treatment guidance and monitoring of disease recurrence. Finally, the demonstrated success of this clinical tool in oral epithelial cancer will herald future success with other cancers of epithelial origin, which accounts for more than 80% of all cancers. Early detection of both new and recurrent oral cancer holds great promise for improving both the survival rate and the quality of live of these patients. The proposed work is to develop a clinical tool capable of quantifying noninvasively different biomarkers associated to oral epithelial cancer progression and detecting early stage oral cancer and dysplasia. Such tool will revolutionize oral epithelial cancer management by allowing not only early screening and diagnosis, but also treatment guidance and monitoring for disease recurrence.",Endogenous fluorescence lifetime endoscopy for early detection of oral cancer and dysplasia,10005895,R01CA218739,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Characteristics', 'Chicago', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Coenzymes', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Face', 'Fluorescence', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Professional', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'In Situ', 'Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mild Dysplasia', 'Minor Surgical Procedures', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Monitoring for Recurrence', 'Neck', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Oral Stage', 'Oral cavity', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pharyngeal structure', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Salivary', 'Screening for Oral Cancer', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'early screening', 'exfoliative cytology', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'oral cavity epithelium', 'oral dysplasia', 'oral lesion', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'volunteer']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA NORMAN,R01,2020,522053,0.050045383744887637
"DR. EPS: Drug Repurposing for Extended Patient Survival Project Summary Human cancers are complex diseases that present vast heterogeneity, leading to widely different survival outcomes. Thus actionable and robust predictive models for cancer prognosis are much needed for more personalized treatment and disease management. However, There has been severely lacking of therapeutically actionable computational methods, which explicitly model patient survival difference as the objective while integrating multi-dimension high-throughput genomics data. To solve this issue, we propose a novel actionable framework for caner drug repurposing, called DR. EPS (Drug Repurposing for Extended Patient Survival). Towards this goal, we will develop the following strategies: (1) Constructing and validating a new class of hybrid-learning based, multi-omics prognosis modeling approach, using seven diverse liver cancer population cohorts. (2) Developing and experimentally validating an actionable computational drug- repurposing framework to improve the survival of high-risk liver cancer patients, using big sets of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics data. (3) Building a user-friendly webtool that accelerates such bench-to-bed transition for liver cancer treatment. We expect that this project will be groundbreaking in many aspects, including building new prognostic models on multi-omics data sets, identifying new repurposed drugs to extend high-risk liver cancer patient life-spans, and providing a first-hand drug reposition resource for liver cancer therapeutics research community. Project Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop an actionable drug-repurposing framework, in order to extend the survival time of high-risk liver cancer patients. We will first build and validate novel and robust prognostic computational models that integrate multi-omics cancer data, then use signatures obtained from the high-risk survival group are to identify repurposed drug candidates.

"Developing high-throughput genetic perturbation strategies for single cells in cancer organoids PROJECT SUMMARY  To address the complexity of heterogeneous cancers that are resistant to chemotherapy and frequently recur or metastasize, we propose to develop a set of tools based on multidisciplinary innovations combining Synthetic Biology, Cancer Organoid Technology, and Bioinformatics. These Synthetic Tools to Annotate Reporter Organoids for Cancer Heterogeneity and Recurrence Development (StarOrchard) include: Synthetic Promoter Activated Recombination of Kaleidoscopic Organoids (SPARKO), Combinatorial Genetics En Masse (CombiGEM), and single-cell RNA sequencing panorama (Scanorama). SPARKO can annotate heterogeneous cancer populations in living cells via fluorescent protein expression libraries to make multi- colored tumor organoids. CombiGEM can rapidly identify potential therapeutic targets via large-scale, massively parallel, and unbiased combinatorial genetic screens. Scanorama can integrate the analysis of large datasets of single-cell transcriptomics via sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms. These tools focus on barcoding strategies to enable accurate tracking and analysis of individual tumor cells that harbor distinct genetic aberrations, and substantially expand the utility of the Next Generation Cancer Models (NGCMs) for cancer mechanistic investigations or therapeutic discovery. The StarOrchard tools enable targeted genetic perturbations in annotated heterogeneous tumor phenotypes without destroying cells for sequencing. These tools will be applied to a large number and variety of NGCMs to optimize experimental protocol. To ensure success, we have convened an outstanding team: PI Timothy K. Lu, MD, PhD, has made strikingly original contributions to Synthetic Biology tools that enable high-throughput genetic interrogation of cancer cell drug dependency; PI Ömer Yilmaz, MD, PhD, has extensive expertise in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and has developed novel technologies to maintain patient-derived colon cancer organoids for in vivo modeling; and PI Bonnie Berger, PhD, will use her expertise in bioinformatics and her Scanorama algorithm to integrate data across all tumor types based on dynamic single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We are also supported by leading experts in cancer biology and various cancer types at both the basic science and clinical oncology frontiers of cancer research.

"Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides PROJECT SUMMARY: Tissue-based investigation remains a cornerstone of cancer research. With the advent of cost-effective digital scanners, large-scale quantitative investigations are now feasible using high throughput analysis of two- dimensional (2D) image datasets. However, 2D image analytics has its limitations, since pathologic diseases occur in three-dimensional (3D) space and 2D representations suffer from significant information loss. There are major gaps for 3D analytical digital pathology, including lack of image analysis tools to quantitatively process 3D data volumes and lack of an effective and scalable data management and analytical infrastructure to model, curate, query and mine large-scale spatial pathology features and biomarkers. We propose to fill these gaps with a new informatics solution directed at better understanding of 3D tumor micro-environments, with driving use cases on immunotherapy study for enhanced immune cell infiltration for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pathophysiological study of rapid tumor progression in brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). In line with Human Tumor Atlas program, we propose to create a novel and comprehensive 3D digital pathology analytics framework to quantitatively analyze spatial patterns of pathologic hallmarks and biomarkers related to disease progression in an authentic 3D tissue environment with quantitative digital pathology image volume processing, spatially integrative histology-molecular image analysis, large-scale spatial data analytics, and key cellular compartment tracking for clinical treatment response test and immunotherapy development. To enable a wide use of informatics tools for 3D digital pathology imaging data in cancer research, we will further upgrade a comprehensive, web-based system for multi-modality microscopy image management, dissemination, and visualization. We will leverage a large set of informatics tools and algorithms we have developed for microscopy image analysis, integrative translational cancer research, pathology spatial analytics, and high performance computing in the past 14 years. The developed tools will be tested and used by a suite of well-funded cancer research projects on pancreatic cancer, brain tumor, head and neck, liver, and lung cancers. The proposed informatics tools will enable precise and comprehensive characterizations of the histologic, molecular, cellular and tissue-level interactions at critical transition stages in cancer progression. They will also allow for a precise interrogation of physical and spatial signatures of immune cell infiltration into tumors, and the interactions between the host immune system and tumor cell metastasis within a complex tumor micro-environment architecture, essential for immunotherapy development. The completion of the proposed study will boost our informatics technology capabilities for large scale microscopy image analytics, help cancer researchers accurately understand cancer biology and progression mechanisms, and enable clinicians an easy access to clinically relevant information from large scale microscopy images for computer based diagnosis and therapeutic development. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tissue based cancer research and therapy development are significantly challenged by strong tumor heterogeneity, biased information derived from two-dimensional tissue sections, spatially distorted genetic biomarker profiles in tissue space, and lack of dynamic Tumor Micro-Environment (TME) characterizations, presenting a serious barrier to enhance cancer research and treatment. Informatics tools for three- dimensional (3D) digital pathology imaging data capturing both histology hallmarks and molecular biomarkers from both static and dynamic environments are promising to create longitudinal human tumor atlas, necessary for in-depth TME and its progression study. We, therefore, propose to create a scalable and effective 3D digital pathology analytics framework for large-scale 3D pathology imaging data, providing novel and accessible methods on pathology image integration, analysis, visualization, and 3D spatial pathology/biomarker data query for efficient test and discovery of spatial interactions of 3D pathology and biomarker objects in cancer research and targeted therapy development.",Computational pathology software for integrative cancer research with three-dimensional digital slides,9980817,U01CA242936,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Research Project', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Genetic Markers', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Head Cancer', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Motivation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Online Systems', 'Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Slide', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Visualization', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cost effective', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'fluorescence imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'pathology imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'spatiotemporal', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor initiation', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'two-dimensional', 'web app']",NCI,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,374477,0.030397887741674887
"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,9827559,R01CA214428,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'CLIA certified', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Designer Drugs', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Economics', 'Feedback', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Observational Study', 'Oregon', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer genomics', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'genomic profiles', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'user-friendly']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,602872,0.03255898047693833
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,9842277,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,413430,0.012116036495842065
