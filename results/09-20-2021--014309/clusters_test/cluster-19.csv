"Innovative Vaccine Approaches ABSTRACT Support is requested for a Keystone Symposia conference entitled Innovative Vaccine Approaches, organized by Drs. Mariagrazia Pizza, Galit Alter and Gordon Dougan. The conference will be held in Vancouver, Canada from June 27- July 1, 2021. Vaccines have the power to prevent and potentially eradicate a wide range of infectious diseases, representing one of the most effective life-saving measures at our disposal against global health threats. The recent coronavirus pandemic has brought the importance and urgency of vaccine development efforts into sharp focus. Moreover, the vaccinology field is evolving very rapidly, thanks to advances in our understanding of microbiology, immunology and genomics, as well as advances in structural analysis of antigens and antigen- antibody complexes and impacts of variation. Over the years, this field has also experienced an elucidation of mechanisms of immunity and protection, and identification of correlates. However, many questions are still unsolved and innovative approaches are needed to address new vaccine challenges like antimicrobial resistance, emerging infectious diseases, cancer and diseases associated with our aging population. This conference will cover the latest advances and novel approaches towards vaccine development, including: (1) novel antigen delivery systems; (2) in vitro and in vivo model systems for vaccine appraisal (3) the use of human challenge models; (4) the role of ‘systems biology’ in the comprehensive analysis of immune correlates, biomarker identification and safety; (5) machine-learning approaches to define correlations between antibody repertoires and protection; and (6) strategies for developing low cost vaccines for economically challenged populations. Together these topics will provide attendees with the new ideas and tools to continue to forge new frontiers in vaccine capabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Vaccines have the power to prevent and potentially eradicate a wide range of both infectious and non- infectious diseases. The field is evolving very rapidly due to improvements in our understanding of microbiology, immunology and genomics, as well as advances in structural analysis techniques. This conference will accelerate advances the field, bringing together public and private communities to ensure the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and other epidemics that afflict the population. This event provides a unique opportunity for discussion of the key challenges in making low cost vaccines for economically challenged populations and how to address burning topics such as pandemics, antimicrobial resistance, emerging infectious diseases, cancer and an aging population.",Innovative Vaccine Approaches,10237543,R13AI161938,"['Address', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Biological Models', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Canada', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Coronavirus', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Immersion', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'experience', 'frontier', 'global health', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'manufacturability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel vaccines', 'pandemic disease', 'posters', 'prevent', 'symposium', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine discovery', 'vaccinology']",NIAID,KEYSTONE SYMPOSIA,R13,2021,8000
"Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways Project Summary  We seek renewal of the core operating funding for the Reactome Knowledgebase of Human Biological Pathways and Processes. Reactome is a curated, open access biomolecular pathway database that can be freely used and redistributed by all members of the biological research community. It is used by clinicians, geneti- cists, genomics researchers, and molecular biologists to interpret the results of high-throughput experimental studies, by bioinformaticians seeking to develop novel algorithms for mining knowledge from genomic studies, and by systems biologists building predictive models of normal and disease variant pathways.  Our curators, PhD-level scientists with backgrounds in cell and molecular biology work closely with in- dependent investigators within the community to assemble machine-readable descriptions of human biological pathways. Each pathway is extensively checked and peer-reviewed prior to publication to ensure its assertions are backed up by the primary literature, and that human molecular events inferred from orthologous ones in animal models have an auditable inference chain. Curated Reactome pathways currently cover 8930 protein- coding genes (44% of the translated portion of the genome) and ~150 RNA genes. We also offer a network of reliable ‘functional interactions’ (FIs) predicted by a conservative machine-learning approach, which covers an additional 3300 genes, for a combined coverage of roughly 60% of the known genome.  Over the next five years, we will: (1) curate new macromolecular entities, clinically significant protein sequence variants and isoforms, and drug-like molecules, and the complexes these entities form, into new reac- tions; (2) supplement normal pathways with alternative pathways targeted to significant diseases and devel- opmental biology; (3) expand and automate our tools for curation, management and community annotation; (4) integrate pathway modeling technologies using probabilistic graphical models and Boolean networks for pathway and network perturbation studies; (5) develop additional compelling software interfaces directed at both computational and lab biologist users; and (6) and improve outreach to bioinformaticians, molecular bi- ologists and clinical researchers. Project Narrative  Reactome represents one of a very small number of open access curated biological pathway databases. Its authoritative and detailed content has directly and indirectly supported basic and translational research studies with over-representation analysis and network-building tools to discover patterns in high-throughput data. The Reactome database and web site enable scientists, clinicians, researchers, students, and educators to find, organize, and utilize biological information to support data visualization, integration and analysis.",Reactome: An Open Knowledgebase of Human Pathways,10111538,U41HG003751,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Model', 'Applications Grants', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Reaction', 'Readability', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological research', 'clinically significant', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'novel', 'outreach', 'predictive modeling', 'research study', 'tool', 'web site']",NHGRI,ONTARIO INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RESEARCH,U41,2021,1354555
"AI based system for longitudinal, repeated measure analyses of freely moving C. elegans worms Abstract This project aims to develop WormInvestigator™, a novel, highly innovative system for performing automated, high-throughput and longitudinal studies of the behavior of C. elegans worms freely moving and socially interacting on agar plates (hereafter: ""freely moving worms"") across multiple time points over extended times (e.g., multiple days) with repeated measures designs. Work in Phase I will focus on demonstrating feasibility of our novel, patent pending, WormRecognizer™ technology – the ability to perform automatic, image-based identification of individual C. elegans worms within a group of freely moving worms (""digital tagging of freely moving worms""). Work in Phase II will focus on creating the full functionality of WormInvestigator for the commercial release. The innovation inherent in WormRecognizer will serve as the basis for enabling a game- changing innovation in the field – the ability to perform high throughput longitudinal, repeated measures design analyses of locomotion and other behavior of freely moving C. elegans worms from discrete, non-continuous video sequences. Compared to study designs that have independent groups repeated measures designs offer more statistical power and the possibility to track an effect over time. Specifically, repeated measures designs for analyzing locomotion and other behavior of freely moving worms will allow researchers to definitively assess the likelihood that a particular behavior is associated with a prior behavior, which is impossible without repeated measures designs or impractical continuous imaging and tracking under constant illumination. WormRecognizer will leverage the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to perform automatic identification of the tracks of the same worm in videos of groups of freely moving worms recorded at different time points; encouraging pilot data were generated during preparation of this application. C. elegans is increasingly used as a model organism in research focusing on brain mechanisms underlying complex behaviors and pathological alterations thereof, including research into neurodevelopment, Alzheimer's disease, autism, schizophrenia and traumatic brain injury. Thus, WormInvestigator will enable significant advancements in various mental neuroscience applications that use C. elegans as a model organism. Specifically, the fact that C. elegans express many of the neurotransmitters and associated receptors that are found in higher eukaryotes, including humans, makes C. elegans highly attractive for the (high throughput) screening of next generation therapeutics for mental diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, as well as for disorders that rely on neurotransmitter release modulation such as next generation treatments for schizophrenia. We will perform extensive feasibility studies, product validation and usability studies of WormInvestigator in close collaboration with expert neuroscientists. Market research performed during preparation of this application indicated that WormInvestigator will expand the use of C. elegans as a model organism to many laboratories that do not currently use them. A competing technology is not available. We anticipate the global market size for WormInvestigator to be more than 300 systems. Narrative Performing longitudinal studies and repeated measures design analyses in both short-term and long-term experimental assays focusing on the analysis of locomotion and other behavior of multiple C. elegans worms holds the promise of profound progress in next-generation neuroscience studies such as understanding neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, as well as aging research, drug discovery and toxicology. Our proposed product will be a transformative technology, using new analytical methods based on artificial intelligence algorithms that, for the first time, will enable researchers to perform these data-rich longitudinal studies and, thus, repeated measures design analyses in assays using C. elegans as a model organism. This system will allow researchers to make new discoveries based on new studies that are currently not feasible, ultimately providing the basis for developing novel treatments to prevent and fight complex brain diseases.","AI based system for longitudinal, repeated measure analyses of freely moving C. elegans worms",10258638,R43MH126834,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Agar', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Eukaryota', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Lighting', 'Locomotion', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Market Research', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Microscope', 'Molecular', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nematoda', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population Analysis', 'Preparation', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Serotonin', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'fighting', 'free behavior', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'longitudinal analysis', 'neural network architecture', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmitter release', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'social', 'usability']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R43,2021,449987
"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,10113656,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contig', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,397125
"Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (R35) PROJECT SUMMARY The “Tools for Transmission of Agents and Conditions (TRAC)” program will synergize statistical and mathematical modeling work in three areas of application: 1) Tuberculosis (TB) incidence and transmission; 2) monitoring substance use disorder (SUD) patterns; and 3) SARS CoV-2 transmission modeling. These three conditions are major public health problems, with TB being the leading cause of infectious disease death globally, SUD causing more deaths in the United States than HIV/AIDS in its peak, and SARS CoV-2 causing a pandemic with societal disruption and mortality exceeding anything we have experienced in the last century. We need improved analytical tools that leverage existing data to monitor these diseases, infer transmission hot spots, determine the efficacy of interventions, and understand the burden of these conditions. This program will bring together an expert group of quantitative researchers with skills that are readily applied to these problems. We also leverage our strong collaborations with clinician researchers and public health officials to ensure that the methods we develop are addressing important questions and consistent with our current understanding of these diseases. By creating a program to facilitate communication between these experts, we will enable greater innovation in modeling key aspects of these diseases and create exciting methodological synergies across diseases. Our team is well positioned to incorporate data from emerging technologies, including high throughput sequencing data to determine TB risk signatures and inform transmission links for TB and SARS CoV-2. Our expertise in machine learning, a broad range of statistical methodologies, and mathematical modeling will enable us to leverage the rich information in large databases that are emerging to better understand SUD patterns and identify risk signatures. We will also build infrastructure with our partners to make the analytical tools that we develop more accessible to public health practitioners and other researchers. The impact of this work is to develop a suite of analytical tools that leverage rapidly emerging rich data sets to improve our understanding of disease transmission patterns, monitor changing dynamics of these conditions, and understand intervention strategies that are most effective. This work will inform public health practice for these diseases and create reproducible tools that can be used in an ongoing way. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will generate analytical tools to address three major public health challenges: 1) Tuberculosis, 2) Substance use disorders, and 3) SARS CoV-2. These tools will improve our understanding of the transmission patterns of these diseases, advance our ability to monitor them, and inform intervention strategies. We will build infrastructure to make these methods available to public health practitioners and other researchers.",Maximizing Investigators' Research Award (R35),10205596,R35GM141821,"['2019-nCoV', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Practice', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 transmission', 'Statistical Models', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'skills', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R35,2021,171876
"A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth This project provides a data science framework and a toolbox of best practices for systematic and reproducible data-driven methods for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. Despite recent advances in methods for data-driven constructs, results are often hard to reproduce using samples from other studies. There is a lack of systematic statistical methods and analytical design for enhancing reproducibility. To fill this gap, we will develop a data science framework, including novel scalable algorithms and software, to derive and validate RDoC constructs. Although the proposed methods will generally apply to all RDoC domains and constructs, we focus specifically on furthering understanding of the RDoC domains of cognitive control (CC) and attention (ATT) constructs implicated in attention deficit disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Our application will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral, and clinical/self-report data from large, nationally representative samples from the on Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and multiple local clinical samples with ADHD and OCD. Specifically, using the baseline ABCD samples, in aim 1, we will apply and develop methods to assess and validate the current configuration of RDoC for CC and ATT using confirmatory latent variable modeling. We will implement and develop new unsupervised learning methods to construct new computational-driven, brain-based domains from multi-modal image data. In Aim 2, We will introduce network analysis (via Gaussian graphical models) to characterize heterogeneity in the interrelationship of RDoC measurements due to observed characteristics (i.e., age and sex). We will further model the heterogeneity of the population due to unobserved characteristics by introducing the data-driven precision phenotypes, which are the subgroup of participants with similar RDoC dimensions. We propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Generative Model and scalable algorithm for simultaneous dimension reduction and identify precision phenotypes. The model also serves as a tool to transfer information from the community sample ABCD to local clinical enriched studies. In aim 3, we will utilize the follow-up samples from ABCD and local clinical enriched data sets to validate the results from Aims 1 and 2 and assess the clinical utility of the precision phenotypes in predicting psychological development in follow-up time. Our project will provide a suite of analytical tools to validate existing RDoC constructs and derive new, reproducible constructs by accounting for various sources of heterogeneity. To advance the understanding of psychopathology using dimensional constructs of measurements from multiple units of analysis, we propose reproducible statistical framework for validating and deriving RDoC constructs with relevance to psychopathology. We will use multi-modal neuroimaging, behavioral and clinical/self-report data from multiple samples to develop this framework. The design of our study consists of analyzing large, nationally representative samples, validating the results in local clinically enriched samples, and transfer information from the large community samples to local clinical samples.",A Data Science Framework for Empirically Evaluating and Deriving Reproducible and Transferrable RDoC Constructs in Youth,10250553,R01MH124106,"['11 year old', 'Accounting', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychopathology', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'age effect', 'analytical tool', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'biological sex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'independent component analysis', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,660324
"ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks We propose an Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation of Ranked Networks (ARAGORN), which will query Knowledge Providers (KPs) and synthesize answers relevant to user-specified questions, building upon algorithms and components developed as part of the ROBOKOP [1,2] application during the feasibility phase of Translator. The ARAGORN services represent the next generation of ROBOKOP component services, iterating and innovating in response to challenges exposed in the Translator feasibility phase. Based on that work, we have identified overarching issues that must be addressed to truly unleash the power of Translator. 1. ARAs must be able to operate in a federated knowledge environment effectively and efficiently. First-generation Translator tools assembled full data sets from which to extract answers, which were subsequently ranked. Second-generation tools must be able to efficiently operate on massive, distributed data, demanding a new approach. ARAGORN will act asynchronously, interleaving KP queries with partial scoring of answers, prioritizing search directions on-the-fly, and delivering early results that are updated over time in response to newly explored paths 2. ARAs must bridge the precision mismatch between data representations and algorithms that require specificity, and users who pose questions and prefer answers at a more abstract level. Biomedical scientists do not pose questions as database queries. Furthermore, even expert users of current biomedical databases such as ROBOKOP KG or RTX require exploration and experimentation to craft queries to express their intent. ARAGORN will employ multiple strategies to remove this barrier to asking questions effectively, from basic maintenance of a question library, to node generalization, query rewriting, and machine learning techniques such as capsule graph networks. ARAGORN will further use elements of specific answers to create gestalt explanations, clustering, and combining answers with similar content, revealing the commonalities and contradictions in answers. 3. ARAs must be able to generalize answer ranking to address a broader range of question formulations and data types, and to account for counterevidence. In the Translator implementation phase, we anticipate having access to many varied KPs and ARAs that provide diverse quantitative metadata regarding the confidence in assertions or strength of associations. There will be a pressing need to synthesize such data into scores for arbitrarily-shaped answer graphs, in order to filter and prioritize answers for further analysis or user digestion. ARAGORN will address this need by providing a novel scoring algorithm capable of (a) scoring arbitrary directed multi-hypergraphs, (b) accounting for heterogeneous quantitative metadata; and (c) leveraging relationship polarity to incorporate counterevidence. ARAGORN will provide access to this functionality, and connect to KPs using community-defined APIs and data models. The ARAGORN team has contributed to these community efforts during the Translator feasibility phase, and if funded will continue to work with the Standards and Reference Implementations (SRI) group, NCATS staff, and other awardees to continue to define and refine methods and models for data sharing and collaboration. The ARAGORN services will be created with collaboration in mind, such that they can be plugged into larger pipelining and architectural efforts. Most of the risks to the ARAGORN strategy are shared by the entire program; as standardization evolves, the ARAGORN team and other members of the Translator consortium will be required to spend effort updating components. ARAGORN will require access to ontology and similarity tools that we anticipate will be provided by KPs or shared infrastructure; if these do not materialize, the ARAGORN team will create the tools that it needs to accomplish its goals. Additionally, we are assuming the existence of fully translator-compliant KPs from which to draw data; if the program collectively decides that compliance is enforced in ARAs instead, we will draw on our work in ROBOKOP to implement the necessary normalization components in ARAGORN. n/a",ARAGORN: Autonomous Relay Agent for Generation Of Ranked Networks,10332268,OT2TR003441,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Digestion', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Ontology', 'Phase', 'Provider', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'arbitrary spin', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'capsule', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'database query', 'distributed data', 'innovation', 'member', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tool']",NCATS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,OT2,2021,1052712
"Biomedical Data Translator Development of Autonomous Relay Agent: ARAX This project would continue collaborative work within the Translator consortium by a multi-site team (“Team X-ray”) at Oregon State University (PI Stephen Ramsey) and at two partner institutions, Pennsylvania State University (PI Koslicki) and the Institute for Systems Biology (PI Eric Deutsch; Co-I Jared Roach). Team X-ray was highly productive in Translator's feasibility assessment phase and the team brings critical expertise to Translator (see Resources). Component type: We propose to create, validate, and integrate an autonomous relay agent (ARA) called ARAX . ARAX will be a middleware component in the new Translator architecture that will extend significantly beyond the capabilities of the prototype reasoning tool (RTX) that we created in the feasibility assessment phase. Depending on the input request, ARAX's main output will be ranked subgraphs with clearly explained ranking basis. ARAX will leverage code and algorithms from RTX and will have an explicit application focus area, as described below. Main problems that ARAX is trying to address: Connections within a biomedical knowledge graph have highly variable degrees of (i) confidence (due to ambiguous predicates and/or due to highly variable degrees of reliability of knowledge types) and (ii) potential relevance to the user's query. Such edge-significance variability leads to both incorrect and difficult-to-interpret results which together pose a significant problem for creating broadly useful tools for computer-based biomedical reasoning. We propose to address this problem by explicitly accounting for these two types of edge variability in the reasoning algorithms–spanning a broad range of biomedical query types–that ARAX will provide to Translator. In addition to these broad capabilities, as described in the Project Plan, we will incorporate advanced algorithms in ARAX for responding to queries relating to disease therapy, including (1) drug repositioning for known disease, leveraging knowledge about the disease’s pathogenesis [1] ; and (2) therapeutic recommendations for rare diseases based on symptoms and the putative causal genetic variant. Plan for implementation of the project: In our Project Plan we describe a five-year timeline for creating, validating, and integrating ARAX within Translator, beginning with a three-month sprint leading to a prototype of ARAX by mid-March 2020. Key components of the plan include: (1) leveraging the BioThings Explorer software framework to enable ARAX to dynamically map between compounds, proteins, pathways, variants, phenotypes, and diseases based on knowledge source application programming interfaces in the Translator registry; (2) leveraging COHD and related Translator resources to obtain biomedical semantic distance information; (3) leveraging an application programming interface endpoint for the RTX biomedical knowledge graph, KG2; and (4) implementing probabilistic reasoning algorithms leveraging provenance information and dynamically determined edge relevance scores to improve reasoning. We will systematically use machine-learning to align ranking scores with measures of output quality. Collaboration strengths of our team include (i) developing technical standards for communications between Translator software agents (leveraging PI Deutsch’s extensive past experience); (ii) developing knowledge graph standards (leveraging PI Ramsey’s and PI Koslicki’s expertise); and (iii) deriving use-case vignettes that speak to the transformative potential of Translator (leveraging Co-I Roach’s and PI Ramsey’s expertise). In the development phase, our team would continue to collaborate with other teams and with NIH stakeholders in an adaptive, high-bandwidth, and team-boundary-agnostic fashion, as detailed in the Project Plan. Key challenges to building the proposed system are (1) the need to be able to ""chain"" together analytical steps between tools and (2) the need for cooperative development of standards that enable Translator components to interact; we address them in detail in the Project Plan. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Development of Autonomous Relay Agent: ARAX,10333468,OT2TR003428,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Framework', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'knowledge graph', 'middleware', 'prototype', 'tool']",NCATS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,OT2,2021,897051
"Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis Project Summary After nearly five decades of human voice research, much remains unknown regarding muscle control mechanism of voice production. Studies confirmed that vocal fold pre-phonatory posture (geometry, position, tension and stiffness) is among the primary factors controlling vocal fold vibratory dynamics and voice type. However, very limited data is available on muscle control of these properties, primarily due to experimental difficulties. Muscle control of glottic geometry and dynamics has been studied in in vivo human and animal models, but these studies were limited to an endoscopic superior view, thus cannot to provide 3D deformation/movement of the vocal folds. Moreover, tension and stiffness of the vocal fold tissues are very difficult to obtain in vivo due to a lack of reliable techniques. A significant knowledge gap remains regarding how intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILMs) control voice production through vocal fold posturing as well as how ILM dysfunctions, such as vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP), affect voice production by altering vocal fold posturing. In this project, we propose to use an innovative approach that integrates experimental data and state-of-the-art computer modeling techniques to produce a complete dataset of 3D vocal fold postures (geometry, position, tension, stiffness), 3D vocal fold vibratory dynamics, and voice outcomes in the full muscle control space including symmetric, asymmetric and compensative muscle activations. The PI’s group recently developed a state-of-the-art, physics based, 3D computer model that integrates realistic laryngeal anatomy, physiologically quantifiable inputs, inverse material parameterization and machine learning for simulating vocal fold posturing and flow-structure-acoustics interaction (FSAI) during voice production. For this project, we propose to combine this embodied model with experimental data to generate a holistic view of vocal fold posturing and FSAI with great temporal and spatial details in the full muscle control space. In particular, the model will reveal the 3D complexity of vocal fold postures and vibrations and provide measures of tension and stiffness with muscle activations, which have not been available. We propose to use the dataset to elucidate causal links among muscle activity, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold vibration and voice outcome. Muscle combinations with distinct posturing, vibration and acoustic patterns will be identified. The new knowledge is expected to elucidate the muscle control mechanism of voice production through vocal fold posturing. The proposed work has the potential to improve insight into the function and dysfunction of the ILMs and to serve as a foundation for novel, targeted therapeutic approaches. We hope to develop possible biomechanical metrics for the diagnosis and optimal methodology for treatment of VFP. Project Narrative Vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP) is the most common etiology of voice disorders which affects 9% of the U.S. population. Diagnosis and optimal treatment of VFP remain challenging because of incomplete understanding of muscle control mechanism of vocal fold posturing and vibration. This project will build causal links among muscle activation, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold vibration and voice acoustics, allowing for the development of possible biomechanical metrics for diagnosis and optimal treatment of VFP.",Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis,10299679,R15DC019229,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Biomechanics', 'Canis familiaris', 'Computer Models', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Etiology', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Paresis', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'professor', 'simulation', 'targeted treatment', 'vibration', 'vocal cord']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MAINE ORONO,R15,2021,431951
"Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology Project Summary Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have caused large losses of life around the world and continue to present a great public health challenge. IAVs can cause infections in birds, sea mammals, lower mammals (e.g., pigs, dogs, and horses), and humans. Previous studies have demonstrated that the structures of the carbohydrate receptors determine influenza host and tissue tropisms. Thus, it is necessary to understand the receptor- binding properties for IAVs and monitor changes to them, especially for IAVs at the animal–human interface. However, this understanding is hampered by our lack of detailed knowledge of IAV glycan substructures; most of our knowledge is limited to SA2,3Gal-like and SA2,6Gal-like structures. The goals of this project are to develop and validate a machine learning method to identify host-specific glycan substructures for IAVs by using glycan array data and to identify and validate the glycan motifs associated with the host tropisms of IAVs, including those for zoonotic IAVs. The study will focus on natural hosts of IAVs: humans, swine, canines, equines, and various avian species, including common domestic poultry species and wild bird species. We expect to identify structural determinants for receptor binding with human-, swine-, canine-, and avian-origin IAVs. Such knowledge will help us understand the factors that contribute to influenza infection and transmission and thereby facilitate development of an effective influenza vaccine to prevent virus infection and block virus transmission. This knowledge will also help us develop rapid assays for monitoring emerging influenza threats at the animal–human interface. We also expect to develop a computational method for identifying glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms; this method will be able to be adapted to determine functional glycan motifs for other proteins, lectins, antibodies, antisera, and microorganisms, including those of other infectious pathogens, by using glycan arrays. Project Narrative This project will develop and apply a computational tool to identify glycan motifs associated with influenza host tropisms, and the derived knowledge will help us develop effective strategies for influenza prevention and control.",Influenza host specific glycan motif identification through systems biology,10092924,R21AI144433,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Avian Influenza A Virus', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Birds', 'Canis familiaris', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Domestic Fowls', 'Equus caballus', 'Family suidae', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hemagglutinin', 'Human', 'Immune Sera', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza prevention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lectin', 'Life', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural History', 'Pathogenesis', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sea', 'Sialic Acids', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Strategic Planning', 'Streptavidin', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tropism', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus Diseases', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'carbohydrate receptor', 'carbohydrate structure', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flu transmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'influenza infection', 'influenza virus vaccine', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'microorganism', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'rapid test', 'receptor', 'receptor binding', 'respiratory', 'response', 'swine influenza', 'tissue tropism', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'universal influenza vaccine', 'viral transmission', 'wild bird']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2021,199831
"Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) Project Summary In recent decades, Central and South America have experienced spillover of endemic arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) from wildlife reservoirs into humans, exchange and recombination of emerging arboviruses within the region, resurgence of arboviruses previously controlled by vaccination or vector control, introduction and spread of novel arboviruses, and exportation of viruses to other regions. Furthermore, there is great concern that newly-introduced Zika virus may spill back into an enzootic transmission cycle in the Americas. Central and South America encompass enormous vertebrate and invertebrate biodiversity, and these species harbor a broad range of arboviruses whose risk of spillover and spread in humans is presently unknown. Increases in the rates of global travel, invasion of novel vector species, urban expansion, deforestation, and global climate change all elevate the risk of further arbovirus emergence, as does the breakdown of public health structures in Venezuela.  The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE- NEO) project will provide a network of surveillance sites in the neotropics coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter emerging arboviruses. Aim 1 will identify novel and known arboviruses as well as the host-vector networks that sustain transmission of these viruses within the neotropics, map the spatial distribution of these transmission networks, and characterize virus transmission dynamics within these networks. To do so, we will collect mosquitoes and other vectors as well as non-human primates and other vertebrate hosts at multiple sites in areas of high and varied biodiversity in Panama and Brazil and screen these samples for known and novel arboviruses. These data will then be analyzed using niche modeling, machine learning to predict undiscovered hosts and vectors, and dynamical transmission models. Aim 2 will focus on prospective and retrospective analysis of human infection and disease. To do so, we will leverage ongoing human clinical cohorts at multiple sites in Brazil and Panama. We will extend and expand these cohorts, with a particular focus on the immune-mediated interactions among multiple arboviruses at sites of hyperendemicity. We will also develop novel diagnostics to capture known and novel arboviruses and model the impact of human and non-human primate movement on spillover and spillback of target arboviruses.  Data and models generated via these two aims will forewarn local, regional and global public health agencies of arboviruses within Central and South America that pose particularly high risk of spillover, emergence into transmission among humans, and/or international spread. Moreover CREATE-NEO will build local capacity to predict, detect and respond to emerging arboviruses at their point of origin, thereby maximizing the potential to avert full-blown emergence. Project Narrative Arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue, Zika and Mayaro, are emerging at an accelerating rate in Central and South America. The Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encompassing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO) project will provide a nimble and flexible network of surveillance sites in Central and South America coupled to cutting-edge modeling approaches in order to anticipate and counter these threats to public health.",Coordinating Research on Emerging Arboviral Threats Encoing the Neotropics (CREATE-NEO),10170251,U01AI151807,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Americas', 'Animals', 'Arbovirus Infections', 'Arboviruses', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biodiversity', 'Biological', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brazil', 'Central America', 'Chikungunya virus', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Coupled', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Deforestation', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Emergency Situation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Variation', 'Habitats', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Panama', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'South America', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Vaccination', 'Vector-transmitted infectious disease', 'Venezuela', 'Virus', 'West Nile virus', 'Yellow Fever', 'ZIKA', 'Zika Virus', 'Zoonoses', 'chikungunya', 'climate change', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic technologies', 'enzootic', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'high risk', 'insight', 'nanobodies', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'prospective', 'seroconversion', 'surveillance network', 'transmission process', 'vector', 'vector control', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,U01,2021,1519214
"DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API. The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1]. Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets (listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules: (1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2) DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values, and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line, Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites, proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed? How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time? Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domain-agnostic data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration). Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular, will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the Standards component to maximize success. n/a",DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets,10330627,OT2TR003443,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'FAIR principles', 'Gene Mutation', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'experience', 'indexing', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'large datasets', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT2,2021,332969
"Center for Open Bioimage Analysis Project Summary  The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve the cell biology community’s growing need for sophisticated software for light microscopy image analysis. Quantitative image analysis has become an indispensable tool for biologists using microscopy throughout basic biological and biomedical research.  Quantifying images is now a critical, widespread need as imaging experiments continue to grow in scale, size, dimensionality, scope, modality, and complexity. Many biologists are missing out on the quantitative bioimaging revolution due to lack of effective algorithms and/or usable software for their needs, or lack of access to training. The Center brings together the Carpenter laboratory at the Broad Institute and the Eliceiri laboratory at the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and in doing so brings together the two most popular open source bioimage analysis projects, ImageJ (including ImageJ2 and FIJI) and CellProfiler. Through the collaborative development and dissemination of open source image analysis software, as well as training events and resources, the Center will empower thousands of researchers to apply advanced analytics in innovative ways to address new experimental areas.  Building on the team’s expertise developing algorithms and user­friendly software for use in biology under real­world conditions, the Center will focus on two Technology Research and Development (TR&D) projects: deep learning­based image processing, and accessibility of image­processing algorithms for biologists. This work will not occur in isolation at the Center; rather, the Center will nucleate a larger community working on these two areas and serve as a catalyst and organizing force to create software and resources shared by all.  The Driving Biological Projects (DBPs) will serve a major role in driving the TR&D work: our teams are accustomed to working deeply and iteratively on problems side by side and with frequent feedback from biologists. This will ensure that important cell biological problems drive the work of the Center. The DBPs reflect tremendous variety in terms of biological questions, model systems, imaging modalities, and researcher expertise and will ensure robustness of our tools for the widest possible impact on the community. Continuing the teams’ track record with ImageJ and CellProfiler, two mature open source bioimage analysis software projects critical to the work of biologists worldwide, the Center will also assist and train biologists in applying the latest computational techniques to important biological problems involving images.  In short, the need for robust, accurate, and readily usable software is more urgent than ever. The Center for Open Bioimage Analysis will serve as a hub for pioneering new computational strategies for diverse biological problems, translating them into user­friendly software, further developing ImageJ and CellProfiler, and training the biological community to apply advanced software to important and diverse problems in cell biology. Project Narrative Biologists studying a huge variety of diseases and basic biological processes need software to measure cells, tissues, and organisms in microscopy images. We will create the Center for Open Bioimage Analysis which will catalyze the scientific community, creating resources, free software, and training that allow biologists to analyze images using deep learning and other new image processing algorithms, offering improved accuracy, convenience, and reproducibility.",Center for Open Bioimage Analysis,10061631,P41GM135019,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Measures', 'Microscopy', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Organism', 'Organoids', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Software Engineering', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'catalyst', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'hackathon', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light microscopy', 'microscopic imaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'skills', 'symposium', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",P41,2021,1261742
"Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall Project Summary Every new experience in our life takes place within the context of familiar environments and situations. However, most research on memory has focused on the artificial memorization of word lists, symbols or pictures; these studies do not meaningfully address how structured prior knowledge about the world (e.g., in the form of a familiar spatial map, or knowledge of how restaurant meals unfold over time) can scaffold new learning. In the proposed studies, I aim to precisely characterize how and where prior knowledge and new information are represented, how they get linked at encoding, and how they interact at recall to allow memories to be retrieved. In the first proposed study of my F99 phase, I test the hypothesis that hippocampal engagement at event boundaries during learning binds new information (i.e. objects) to the scaffold of existing knowledge (i.e. knowledge of a familiar location), and that hippocampal activation during recall mediates the successful retrieval of the bound object from the location in which it was stored. I also test the hypothesis that distinctive representations of spatial locations in the brain will reduce interference between objects stored in those locations. There is a potential downside to using prior knowledge as a scaffold: When there is too much information attached to one part of the scaffold, old and new memories will interfere with each other. How, then, could someone prioritize the retrieval of new memories over older (now-irrelevant) memories that were linked to the scaffold? Recent research on intentional forgetting suggests a solution to this limitation. Specifically, in my second proposed study, I test the hypothesis (supported by neurophysiological evidence, prior neuroimaging results, and computational models) that previously encoded memories can be weakened by moderately activating their neural representation, thereby “cleaning” the scaffold and reducing interference. In the K00 phase, I will extend my research to identify pathologies in how clinical populations use prior knowledge to interpret and remember their experiences, using tools from computational psychiatry; I also plan to design new technological tools to address these issues. Overall, the proposed project makes use of naturalistic and ecologically valid stimuli (in the form of continuous stimuli and immersive virtual reality) paired with advanced machine learning tools applied to brain imaging data, to study the fundamental nature of how new and old information are linked to allow learning. In the long-term, the findings from this project regarding how prior knowledge can be optimally leveraged to support new learning will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly. Project Narrative In my dissertation, I will use newly-developed machine learning techniques to study how the brain uses prior knowledge (about the spatial structure of an environment, or how certain types of events unfold in time) to scaffold new learning. By precisely characterizing how this scaffolding process works, my research will help to identify ways in which prior knowledge can be more optimally leveraged to support learning. This will lead to the development of tools to help memory-impaired individuals make better use of intact prior knowledge to support new learning, as well as remedies for groups where deficiencies in prior knowledge prevent them from learning properly.",Tracking the dynamics of how schemas scaffold recall,10156352,F99NS120644,"['Address', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Restaurants', 'Retrieval', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'field study', 'forgetting', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'phase 1 testing', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'virtual', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2021,47036

"Next-generation Monte Carlo eXtreme Light Transport Simulation Platform Project Summary/Abstract Abstract: The rapid evolution of the field of biophotonics has produced numerous emerging techniques for combatting diseases and addressing urgent human health challenges, offering safe, non-invasive, and portable light-based diagnostic and therapeutic methods, and attracting exponentially growing attention over the past decade. Rigorous, fast, versatile and publicly available computational tools have played pivotal roles in the success of these novel approaches, leading to breakthroughs in new instrumentation designs and extensive explorations of complex biological systems such as human brains. The Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX, http://mcx.space) light transport simulation platform developed by our team has become one of the most widely disseminated biophotonics modeling platforms, known for its high accuracy, high speed and versatility, as attested to by its over 27,000 downloads and nearly 1,000 citations from a large (2,400+ registered users) world-wide user community. Over the past years, we have also been pushing the boundaries in cutting-edge Monte Carlo (MC) photon simulation algorithms by exploring modern GPU architectures, advanced anatomical modeling methods and systematic software optimizations. In this proposed project, we will build upon the strong momentum created in the initial funding period, and strive to further advance the state-of-the-art of GPU-accelerated MC light transport modeling with strong support from the world’s leading GPU manufacturers and experts, further expanding our platform to address a number of emerging challenges in biomedical optics applications. Specifically, we will further explore emerging GPU architecture and resources, such as ray- tracing cores, half- and mixed-precision hardware, and portable programming models, to further accelerate the MC modeling speed. We will also develop hybrid shape/mesh-based MC algorithms to dramatically advance the capability in simulating extremely complex yet realistic anatomical structures, such as porous tissues in the lung, dense vessel networks in the brain, and multi-scaled tissue domains. In parallel, we aim to make a break- through in applying deep-learning-based image denoising techniques to equivalently accelerate MC simulations by 2 to 3 orders of magnitudes, as suggested in our preliminary studies. In the continuation of this project, we strive to create a dynamic and community-engaging simulation environment by extending our software to allow users to create, share, browse, and reuse pre-configured simulations, avoiding redundant works in re-creating complex simulations and facilitating reproducible research. In addition, we will expand our well-received user training programs and widely disseminate our open-source tools via major Linux distributions and container images. At the end of this continued funding period, we will provide the community with a significantly accelerated, widely-available and well-supported biophotonics modeling platform that can handle multi-scaled tissue optical modeling ranging from microscopic to macroscopic domains. Project Narrative The Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX) light transport modeling platform has quadrupled its user community and paper citation numbers during the initial funding period. Building upon this strong momentum, we aim to further explore computational acceleration enabled by emerging GPU architectures and resources, and spearhead novel Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms to address the emerging needs of a broad biophotonics research community. We also dedicate our efforts to the further dissemination, training and usability enhancement of our software, and provide timely support to our large (>2,400 registered users) and active (>300 mailing list subscribers) user community.",Next-generation Monte Carlo eXtreme Light Transport Simulation Platform,10228757,R01GM114365,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Benchmarking', 'Biophotonics', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Future Generations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Linux', 'Lung', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Training Support', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'complex biological systems', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'design', 'flexibility', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'interoperability', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open data', 'open source', 'portability', 'rapid growth', 'simulation', 'simulation environment', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,349146
"Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots  Emergence of undervaccinated geographical clusters for diseases like measles has become a national concern. A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in recent months, despite high MMR coverage in the United States ( 95%). Such undervaccinated clusters can act as reservoirs of infection that can transmit the disease to a wider population, magnifying their importance far beyond what their absolute numbers might indicate. The existence and growth of such undervaccinated clusters is often known to public health agencies and health provider networks, but they typically do not have enough resources to target people in each such cluster, to attempt to improve the vaccination rate. Preliminary results show that not all undervaccinated clusters are “equal” in terms of their potential for causing a big outbreak (referred to as its “criticality”), and the rate of undervaccination in a cluster does not necessarily correlate with its criticality.  However, there are no existing methods to estimate the potential risk of such clusters, and to identify the most “critical” ones. Some of the key reasons are: (i) purely data-driven spatial statistics methods rely only on immunization coverage, which does not give any indication of the risk of an outbreak; and (ii) current causal epidemic models need to be combined with detailed incidence data, which has not been easily available.  This proposal brings together a systems science approach, combining agent-based stochastic epidemic models, and techniques from machine learning, high performance computing, data mining, and spatial statistics, along with novel public and private datasets on immunization and incidence, to develop a novel methodology for identifying critical clusters, through the following tasks: (i) Identify spatial clusters with signiﬁcantly low immunization rates, or strong anti-vaccine sentiment; (ii) Develop an agent based model for the spread of measles that incorporates detailed immunization data, and is calibrated using a novel source of incidence data; (iii) Develop methods to ﬁnd and characterize critical spatial clusters, with respect to different metrics, which capture both epidemic and economic burden, and order underimmunized clusters based on their criticality; and (iv) Use the methodology to evaluate interventions in terms of their effect on criticality. A highly interdisciplinary team involving two universities, a health care delivery organization and a state department of Health, will work together to develop this methodology. Characterization of such clusters will enable public health departments and policy makers in targeted surveillance of their regions and a more efﬁcient allocation of resources. Project Narrative  This project will develop a new methodology to quantify the potential risks of under-vaccinated spatial clusters for highly infectious diseases. It will rank the clusters based on their economic and epidemic burden which will enable public health ofﬁcials in targeted surveillance and interventions, to mitigate their risk.",Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots,10197938,R01GM109718,"['Affect', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral Model', 'California', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Clusterings', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease model', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Herd Immunity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'New Jersey', 'New York', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Resolution', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Source', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'diverse data', 'economic cost', 'economic outcome', 'health care delivery', 'health disparity', 'health organization', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'provider networks', 'public health intervention', 'social', 'social media', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'vaccine hesitancy']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,321062
"SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A  PROJECT SUMMARY  What if healthcare providers were equipped with biocompatible, biodegradable, robust, and affordable treatment options that combine therapeutic modalities with controlled mechanisms of action? What if this versatile technology had learning capacity and could be educated to recognize patient-specific diseases and interfere with their progression by redirecting fundamental cellular processes? What if the very same formulation could offer an additional means of control over patients’ immune responses and further advance favorable therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicities? These next generation therapies would then become a game changer in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases and disabilities at their source. With the support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular, adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology, immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use. Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A PROJECT NARRATIVE  Beyond their traditionally known roles as carriers and regulators of genetic information, nucleic acids have auspiciously emerged as versatile therapies for taking advantage of cellular pathways to drive the sensing, targeting, and silencing of a variety of diseases. With MIRA support, we will explore additional nanotechnology- based therapeutic options that enlist a biocompatible nucleic acid-encoded platform (SMART NANPs) for the controlled immunostimulation and modulation of therapeutic responses. This research program aims to advance the envisioned technology towards personalized medicine and aid in addressing top public health challenges in the U.S. as they relate to cancer (through vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation), and drug overdose and safety (through the biodegradable nature of the platform and its functional regulation).",SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses,10086567,R35GM139587,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Biopolymers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncology', 'Overdose', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombin', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'clinical application', 'disability', 'genetic information', 'immunoregulation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'monocyte', 'nanoparticle', 'next generation', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHARLOTTE,R35,2021,141556
"ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis Project Summary The morphology (or shape) of anatomical structures forms the common language among clinicians, where ab- normalities in anatomical shapes are often tied to deleterious function. While these observations are often quali- tative, ﬁnding subtle, quantitative shape effects requires the application of mathematics, statistics, and computing to parse the anatomy into a numerical representation that will facilitate testing of biologically relevant hypotheses. Particle-based shape modeling (PSM) and its associated suite of software tools, ShapeWorks, enable learning population-level shape representation via automatic dense placement of homologous landmarks on image seg- mentations of general anatomy with arbitrary topology. The utility of ShapeWorks has been demonstrated in a range of biomedical applications. Despite its obvious utility for the research enterprise and highly permissive open-source license, ShapeWorks does not have a viable commercialization path due to the inherent trade-off between development and maintenance costs, and a specialized scientiﬁc and clinical market. ShapeWorks has the potential to transform the way researchers approach studies of anatomical forms, but its widespread ap- plicability to medicine and biology is hindered by several barriers that most existing shape modeling packages face. The most important roadblocks are (1) the complexity and steep learning curve of existing shape modeling pipelines and their increased computational and computer memory requirements; (2) the considerable expertise, time, and effort required to segment anatomies of interest for statistical analyses; and (3) the lack of interoperable implementations that can be readily incorporated into biomedical research laboratories. In this project, we pro- pose ShapeWorksStudio, a software suite that leverages ShapeWorks for the automated population-/patient-level modeling of anatomical shapes, and Seg3D – a widely used open-source tool to visualize and process volumet- ric images – for ﬂexible manual/semiautomatic segmentation and interactive manual correction of segmented anatomy. In Aim 1, we will integrate ShapeWorks and Seg3D in a framework that supports big data cohorts to enable users to transparently proceed from image data to shape models in a straightforward manner. In Aim 2, we will endow Seg3D with a machine learning approach that provides automated segmentations within a statisti- cal framework that combines image data with population-speciﬁc shape priors provided by ShapeWorks. In Aim 3, we will support interoperability with existing open-source software packages and toolkits, and provide bindings to commonly used programming languages in the biomedical research community. To promote reproducibility, we will develop and disseminate standard workﬂows and domain-speciﬁc test cases. This project combines an interdisciplinary research and development team with decades of experience in statistical analysis and image understanding, and application scientists to conﬁrm that the proposed developments have a real impact on the biomedical and clinical research communities. Our long-term goal is to make ShapeWorks a standard tool for shape analyses in medicine, and the work proposed herein will establish the groundwork for achieving this goal. Project Narrative ShapeWorks is a free, open-source software tool that uses a ﬂexible method for automated construction of sta- tistical landmark-based shape models of ensembles of anatomical shapes. ShapeWorks has been effective in a range of applications, including psychology, biological phenotyping, cardiology, and orthopedics. If funded, this application will ensure the viability of ShapeWorks in the face of the ever-increasing complexity of shape datasets and support its availability to biomedical researchers in the future, as well as provide opportunities for use in a wide spectrum of new biological and clinical applications, including anatomy reconstruction from sparse/low- dimensional imaging data, large-scale clinical trials, surgical planning, optimal designs of medical implants, and reconstructive surgery.","ShapeWorksStudio: An Integrative, User-Friendly, and Scalable Suite for Shape Representation and Analysis",10173765,U24EB029011,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Mail', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Normalcy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Psychology', 'Reconstructive Surgical Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'medical implant', 'open source', 'outreach', 'particle', 'patient population', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'shape analysis', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,U24,2021,256578
"ICEES+ Knowledge Provider: Leveraging Open Clinical and Environmental Data to Accelerate and Drive Innovation in Translational Research and Clinical Care. As part of the feasibility phase of the Translator program, we have developed a disease-agnostic framework and approach for openly exposing clinical data that have been integrated at the patient- and visit-level with environmental exposures data: the Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES). We have validated ICEES and demonstrated the service’s ability to replicate and extend published findings on asthma, while also supporting open team science, accelerated translational discovery, and integration with the broader Translator ecosystem. This proposal aims to move ICEES from prototype to development via creation of an ICEES+ Knowledge Provider (KP). Specifically, we aim to address three major challenges that we have identified through research and development (R&D) of the prototype ICEES in an effort to improve the quality, value, and impact of query answers and assertions. Specific Aim 1. Advance the rigor of insights and assertions that ICEES provides. Our prototype ICEES currently provides the ability to dynamically define cohorts and conduct simple statistical associations to examine bivariate relationships between feature variables. Recently, we have identified an approach to extend the bivariate functionalities to support multivariate analysis of the data. For the proposed work, we will apply multivariate analyses, including traditional statistical methods (e.g., regression models) and machine learning methods (e.g., bayesian neural network models, variational autoencoder models), and systematically quantify the extent of data loss and analytic bounds when algorithms are imposed on the ICEES+ KP open application programming interface (API) versus the Institutional Review Board (IRB)– protected, fully identified, pre-binned, underlying integrated feature tables. The overall goal is to provide users with more rigorous insights and estimates of the robustness, validity, accuracy, and specificity of knowledge and assertions generated via the ICEES+ KP OpenAPI. Specific Aim 2. Address issues related to space–time and causality. Clinical and environmental data are inherently spatiotemporal, with observations or events that are contingent on space and time and may be causally related. For the proposed work, we will evaluate and implement technical approaches (e.g., ICEES+ design modifications), spatiotemporal statistical algorithms (e.g., conditional auto-regression), recurrent neural network models, and causal inference models. As part of this effort, we will derive insights from and contribute real-world evidence to support Causal Activity Models and Adverse Outcome Pathways. We also will explore approaches for incorporating into ICEES+ nationwide public data on school exposures—data that will allow us to begin to address patient mobility. Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the security of the ICEES+ KP to ensure that patient privacy is preserved as new capabilities are enabled. ImPACT is an NSF-funded package of tools and services that provides end-to-end infrastructure and support for privacy-assured research and computation on sensitive data. Over the award period, we will implement and evaluate ImPACT security protocols, focusing initially on application of the ImPACT secure multiparty computation (SMC) algorithm as a method to support secure multi-institutional sharing of data on rare diseases and events—a functionality that is not currently supported by ICEES. In addition, we will evaluate other ImPACT security protocols, working under the guidance of a security advisor and in the context of driving use cases and capabilities developed under Specific Aims1 and 2. Importantly, the project aims will be driven by three use cases and associated high-value queries designed to complement and extend our asthma-focused work on the prototype ICEES: (1) an asthma cohort from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR) at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS); (2) a primary ciliary disease cohort (PCD) from the UNC PCD Registry; and (3) a drug-induced liver injury (DILI) cohort from the National DILI Network. These use cases will invoke new diseases, new data types, new organ systems, new institutions, and new queries, thereby stress-testing the ICEES framework and approach and moving it from prototype to development as the ICEES+ KP. n/a",ICEES+ Knowledge Provider: Leveraging Open Clinical and Environmental Data to Accelerate and Drive Innovation in Translational Research and Clinical Care.,10333478,OT2TR003430,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Bayesian neural network', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress Tests', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'application programming interface', 'autoencoder', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'liver injury', 'machine learning method', 'patient mobility', 'patient privacy', 'preservation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NCATS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,OT2,2021,982187
"Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Summary:  Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients experience limited functional recovery, owing in part to the paucity of axon regrowth from injured CNS neurons. Effective treatments are lacking, likely because of multiple factors, intrinsic and extrinsic, that inhibit axon growth. Thus we require agents that target more than one source of regeneration failure.  Kinases are ubiquitous signal transducers that regulate most cellular processes, including axon growth. To begin to identify compounds that positively regulate axon growth, we screened 1600 small-molecule kinase inhibitors (KIs) in an in vitro CNS neurite outgrowth assay and identified “hit” KIs that reproducibly and strongly promote outgrowth. Due to homology of catalytic domains, KIs typically inhibit multiple kinases. This makes it difficult to identify the kinase(s) that mediate a KI's effects on cells. We used information theory and machine learning to analyze the inhibition profiles of KIs in relation to their effects on neurite outgrowth. This enabled us to identify, and later validate via siRNA knockdown in primary neurons, multiple kinase targets (i.e. kinases that should be inhibited to promote neurite outgrowth). These included previously known targets that regulate intrinsic and extrinsic inhibitor factors, in addition to several novel candidates. Conversely, we identified kinases whose activity is critical for neurite outgrowth, and whose inhibition must be avoided (anti-targets). We discovered several KIs that inhibit multiple targets and no anti-targets. These KIs strongly promoted neurite outgrowth in vitro.  We tested the KI, RO48, that had the largest effect in vitro in two in vivo models. Our preliminary experiments indicate that RO48 is remarkably effective in vivo. It promoted robust axonal growth of the corticospinal tract (CST) in three separate models of CST injury (pyramidotomy, funiculotomy, dorsal hemisection), and in the dorsal hemisection model, improved forelimb function. We propose to build on these remarkable results to test the working hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of RO48's five target kinases (ROCK, PKC, PRKG1, PRKX, and RPS6K) promotes sprouting and regeneration of CST axons. This will be accomplished using viral vectors to knock down expression of the different target kinases individually and in combination. We will do knockdown in CST neurons in the cortex. We will assess CST axon growth at the injury site using light microscopy. We will also perform experiments to determine if RO48-induced CST axon growth promotes axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and whether RO48 improves behavioral outcomes such as grasping and walking after a contusion injury.  These experiments will 1) validate novel kinases as in vivo targets for future development of SCI therapeutics 2) determine whether these kinases regulate CST axon sprouting, regeneration, or both, and 3) confirm whether the substantial stimulation of axon growth induced by treatment with RO48 improves motor outcomes in a clinically relevant contusion model.  Title: Targeting Multiple Kinases to Treat Experimental Spinal Cord Injury Project Narrative: The proposed experiments aim to understand how small-molecule drug-like compounds increase the ability of nerve cells to grow long processes and re-form connections.

"Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Host variation affects the pathogenicity of, susceptibility to, and recovery from infectious diseases. Elucidating how the host environment alters antibiotic susceptibility is therefore a critical step towards the long-term goal of realizig precision medicine for the clinical management of infectious diseases. The overall objective of this project is to identify the metabolic pathways participating in antibiotic susceptibility and t determine how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatments at the site of infection. The working hypothesis is that metabolic processes can function as bacterial control mechanisms for antibiotic susceptibility and that the host metabolome can act on these processes to affect the outcome of antibiotic treatment. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: (1) identif metabolic pathways involved in antibiotic susceptibility (K99 phase); (2) characterize changes in the host metabolome elicited by antibiotic administration (K99 phase); (3) evaluate effects of the host metabolome on antibiotic killing (R00 phase). During the mentored K99 phase, bactericidal antibiotics will be counterscreened with various metabolites to identify metabolic perturbations that can affect antibiotic susceptibility. Metabolic pathways contributing to antibiotic lethality ill be identified by combining this data with metabolic modeling and machine learning. Additionally, plasma and peritoneal fluid will be sampled and metabolomically profiled from a mouse peritoneal infection model, with and without antibiotic treatment. These profiles will be used to determine if antibiotics can alter the host metabolism in ways that may affect antibiotic susceptibility at the site of infection. During the independent R00 phase, the effects of host metabolic variation on antibiotic killing will be systematically tested by quantifying antibiotic susceptibility in synthesized media defined by metabolomic profiles from published and measured human and mouse plasma samples. A better understanding of how the host metabolic environment participates in antibiotic treatment fits NIH's public health mission and has direct implications for the clinical management of infectious diseases. Work from the proposed studies will form a quantitative framework for directly evaluating how host metabolism may affect antibiotic treatment outcomes and guide improved antibiotic stewardship in clinical practice. Although the applicant has significant expertise in systems biology, this award will provide the applicant research training to gain new experimental skills and an opportunity for continued career training and mentorship from an advisory committee comprised of international leaders in systems biology, metabolomics, chemical biology and infectious diseases. The support and training provided by this award and by the advisory committee will provide the applicant tools and expertise critical to his future independent research program. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Host variation alters the clinical response to antibiotic treatment for infectious disease, but the pathways underlying differences in patient outcome have not yet all been elucidated. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is the first systematic investigation of how host metabolites may act on bacterial pathogen metabolism and alter antibiotic susceptibility. This work is relevant to NIH's public health mission by providing a quantitative framework for establishing precision medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases.",Effects of Host Metabolic Variation on Antibiotic Susceptibility,10149339,R00GM118907,"['Adjuvant', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biology', 'C57BL/6 Mouse', 'Carbon', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Resistance', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Innovative Therapy', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitrogen', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Peritoneal', 'Peritoneal Fluid', 'Peritoneal lavage', 'Phase', 'Phosphorus', 'Plasma', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Sulfur', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'bacterial metabolism', 'bactericide', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'commensal microbes', 'counterscreen', 'desensitization', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'infectious disease treatment', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,RBHS-NEW JERSEY MEDICAL SCHOOL,R00,2021,249000
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology. The tool will be available in the public domain (NIH Toolbox) and will facilitate incorporation of psychiatric disorders into the precision medicine initiative.",Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan,10112310,R01MH117014,"['Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention Studies', 'Length', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'PhenX Toolkit', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Preparation', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive performance', 'computerized', 'crowdsourcing', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'digital', 'genomic variation', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'instrument', 'male', 'mobile computing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'protective factors', 'psychiatric symptom', 'response', 'symptom cluster', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'validation studies']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,693835
"The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration Delirium is a serious cognitive disorder associated with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) that affects ~2.6 million older adults yearly. It is a frequent complication of acute illness, surgery and, now, of COVID-19 infection in older adults. Recognizing the relative dearth of delirium research, the National Institute for Aging (NIA) supported the establishment of the Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative interdisciplinary group of 28 investigators, from 27 institutions, to advance delirium research and develop network infrastructure. This included the creation of an annual “NIDUS bootcamp” conference, to bring together the growing national- and international delirium research community for networking and education. The bootcamp aims are to advance the science of the field and to provide junior investigators with intensive mentorship, through mock NIH application reviews, clinical and research lectures, breakout sessions, and post-bootcamp networking. Bootcamp alumni are provided guidance on: 1) using the NIDUS Delirium Research Hub, Measurement resources and Bibliography, 2) submitting proposals to the NIDUS Pilot Program (13 one-year $50,000 grants awarded), NIA GEMSSTAR/CLINSTAR, the Alzheimer’s Association, and other foundations, 3) attending Mentoring webinars, 4) participating in Junior Faculty Working Groups, and 5) submitting research abstracts to the American Delirium Society (ADS) Annual Meeting. As PIs, 94 alumni have received 46 grants, of which 18 (40%) were NIH-funded, and published 265 original peer- reviewed articles. NIDUS has jumpstarted the careers of many young investigators, particularly bootcamp alumni, enabling them to launch independent programs in delirium research. The goal of this application is to support continuation of a yearly, themed Delirium Bootcamp Conference (DBC), to ensure that the progress of this active research community is sustained. The first-year theme will be the inter-relationship between delirium and ADRD. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Engage and support junior investigators in delirium research through mentorship and access to the NIDUS resources/network (2) Boost the researchers’ funding success (3) Facilitate publication of delirium research and provide ongoing mentorship, and (4) Facilitate networking among junior, mid-career, and senior researchers during and after DBC. As the pool of delirium investigators expands, there is a critical need for a conference focused on addressing cutting-edge research methods in all areas of delirium research, including the relationship with ADRD, “-Omics” research, machine learning and big data, innovations in randomized trials, animal models and mechanistic research, and clinical practice improvement. The DBC will provide an unparalleled opportunity to advance cutting-edge delirium research through interactive didactic sessions and in-depth guidance on complex and nuanced research methods essential for the highest caliber and most impactful delirium research. Delirium is a serious, yet understudied, cognitive disorder that affects millions of elder Americans, and is closely related to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). The NIA-supported (2015-2020) Network for Investigation of Delirium Unifying Scientists (NIDUS), a collaborative international network of delirium investigators, developed a successful, annual “NIDUS Bootcamp” conference, laying the foundation for this proposal. The new Delirium Bootcamp (DBC) will convene junior investigators and senior faculty in an annual conference with innovations including: 1) a new thematic focus each year, with the 2021 theme highlighting ADRD; 2) focus on high-impact, state-of-the-art methodologies to advance the field in new directions; 3) finding optimal methods to address the unique challenges of delirium research, and 4) developing collaborative interdisciplinary papers to be initiated at the DBC and completed in ongoing groups; thus, fostering the training, career development and success of the next generation of delirium investigators.",The Network for Investigation of Delirium: Unifying Scientists (NIDUS)'s 9th-13th Annual Delirium Boot Camps: A Foundation for Future Exploration,10237513,R13AG072860,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bibliography', 'Big Data', 'COVID-19', 'Caliber', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Networks', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Delirium', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Expenditures', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Science', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Study Section', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Writing', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'patient population', 'peer', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'senior faculty', 'skill acquisition', 'success', 'support network', 'symposium', 'systematic review', 'webinar', 'working group']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R13,2021,50000
"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,10128442,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,167900
"Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software. Abstract (Proposal title: Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational and Data Processing Tools and Software.): This proposal presents a focused plan for expanding the capabilities of the Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) to meet the evolving needs of neuroscientists engaged in computationally intensive research. The NSG project began in 2012 with support from the NSF. Its initial goal was to catalyze progress in computational neuroscience by reducing technical and administrative barriers that neuroscientists faced in large scale modeling projects involving tools and software which require and run efficiently on high performance computing (HPC) resources. NSG's success is reflected in the facts that (1) its base of registered users has grown continually since it started operation in early 2013 (more than 800 at present), (2) every year the NSG team successfully acquires ever larger allocations of supercomputer time (recently more than 10,000,000 core hours/year) on academic HPC resources of the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery (XSEDE – that coordinates NSF supercomputer centers) program by writing proposals that go through an extremely competitive peer review process, and (3) it has contributed to large number of publications and Ph.D thesis. In recent years experimentalists, cognitive neuroscientists and others have begun using NSG for brain image data processing, data analysis and machine learning. NSG now provides over 20 tools on HPC resources for modeling, simulation and data processing. While NSG is currently well used by the neuroscience community, there is increasing interest from that community in applying it to a wider range of tasks than originally conceived. For example, some are trying to use it as an environment for dissemination of lab-developed tools, even though NSG is not suitable for that use because of delays from the batch queue wait times of production HPC resources, and lack of features and resources for an interactive, graphical, and collaborative environment needed for tool development, benchmarking and testing. “Forced” use of NSG for development and dissemination makes NSG's operators a “person-in-the-middle” bottleneck in the process. Another issue is that newly developed data processing tools require high throughput computing (HTC) usage mode, as opposed to HPC, but currently NSG does not provide access to compute resources suitable for HTC. Additionally, data processing workflows require features such as the ability to transfer large size data, process shared data, and visualize output results, which are not currently available on NSG. The work we propose will enhance NSG by adding the features that it needs to be a suitable and efficient dissemination environment for lab-developed neuroscience tools to the broader neuroscience community. This will allow tool developers to disseminate their lab-developed tools on NSG taking advantage of the current functionalities that are being well served on NSG for the last six years such as a growing user base, an easy user interface, an open environment, the ability to access and run jobs on powerful compute resources, availability of free supercomputer time, a well-established training and outreach program, and a functioning user support system. All of these well-functioning features of NSG will make it an ideal environment for dissemination and use of lab-developed computational and data processing neuroscience tools. The Neuroscience Gateway (NSG) was first implemented to enable large scale computational modeling of brain cells and circuits used to study neural function in health and disease. This new project extends NSG's utility to support development, dissemination and use of new tools by the neuroscience community for analyzing enormous data sets produced by advanced experimental methods in neuroscience.",Neuroscience Gateway to Enable Dissemination of Computational And Data Processing Tools And Software.,10186744,U24EB029005,"['Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain imaging', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Education and Outreach', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Tools', 'Students', 'Support System', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wait Time', 'Work', 'Workload', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'brain cell', 'collaborative environment', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'data sharing', 'image processing', 'interest', 'models and simulation', 'open data', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'tool', 'tool development', 'trend', 'webinar']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2021,377473
"Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites PROJECT SUMMARY The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host, modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however, neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4- ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii) elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the reprogramming therapies, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE A vast and diverse community of microbes known as the gut microbiota colonizes the human intestine. The microbiota is largely a beneficial community, but also produces some potentially toxic compounds that can accumulate to high levels in the circulation of dialysis patients. This proposal aims to define the bacterial species and genes that make these compounds and how the gut microbiota can be rationally altered to reduce the production of toxic substances.",Dietary and Microbial Reprogramming of Intestinal Microbiota-Produced Metabolites,10144417,R01DK101674,"['Ablation', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Anabolism', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Colon', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cresol', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Diet', 'Diet Modification', 'Ecosystem', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Individuality', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Poison', 'Process', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Series', 'Source', 'Sulfate', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Tyrosine', 'Uremia', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'colon microbiota', 'comparative genomics', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'dietary', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'human data', 'human subject', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'microbiota metabolites', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstitution', 'solute', 'tool', 'translation to humans']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,644301
"Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases The placenta is essential for fetal development and growth, maternal homeostasis, and broadly, pregnancy health. Yet, our ability to non-invasively probe placental health during human pregnancy is hampered by its deep intrauterine location and its highly vascular composition, rendering the placenta largely inaccessibly for safe and dynamic investigation. Whereas placental research has been advanced by cell culture, ex vivo systems, animal models, and postpartum analyses, these indirect approaches provide ex post facto information about placental health. Placental imaging has revolutionized the field of placental medicine, but resolution at the molecular, cellular, or metabolic level remains limited. To address these challenges, we and others have focused on the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from placental trophoblasts, which, in humans, are directly bathed in maternal blood. We focused on exosomes (now termed small EVs or sEVs), microvesicles, and apoptotic blebs, which are continuously and abundantly released from trophoblasts into the maternal circulation and are accessible throughout pregnancy by peripheral blood tests. Among these EVs, we focus mainly on placental sEVs, which harbor messages that are seldom expressed by any other cell types and execute unique placental biological functions, such as an antiviral response. While informative, recent data indicate that sEVs are not a uniform population of vesicles, but comprise several subgroups, defined as large sEVs, small sEVs, and exomeres. In addition to their size, these sEV subtypes are characterized by distinctive cargo. Although the recent discovery of sEV subpopulations has excited researchers due to their potential to revolutionize the field of non-invasive diagnostics, sEV subpopulations have yet to be utilized in clinical settings. This is largely due to the difficulties associated with separation and isolation the nano-sized sEV subpopulations. Our group has now developed advanced acoustofluidic technologies designed to effectively, reproducibly, and rapidly isolate sEVs from blood. We show that we can separate placental sEVs into their specific subpopulations, which has not been previously accomplished. Our proposed investigation therefore focuses on the production of human placental sEV subpopulations, along with their RNA and proteome cargo. We posit that, by profiling these analytes from sEV subpopulations, we can illuminate a unique landscape of bioactive molecules that are relevant to placental health. To reduce data complexity, we propose a machine learning pipeline that will be used to probe the sub-sEV spectra during normal and pathological pregnancies. Further, we will improve our ability to purify sEV subpopulations from lipoproteins, and generate a single, integrated device that can reliably separate vesicles in real time across human gestation. We believe that our automated acoustofluidic approach to separating sEV subpopulations in a high-yield, biocompatible manner is critical to unlocking the clinical utility of sEVs. Insights gained from our investigation will improve non-invasive diagnostics during pregnancy and may uncover new targets for personalized placental therapeutics. Our proposal centers on the discovery and analysis of previously unrecognized nanovesicle subpopulations that are produced by placental cells and are released to the maternal-fetal circulation. By studying these nanovesicle subpopulations in health and diseases of human pregnancy and by innovating new technologies to efficiently, rapidly, and reproducibly purify these nanovesicles from the blood and other biological media, we enable pioneering tools to interrogate the placenta in real time and improve clinical care during pregnancy.",Acoustofluidic Separation of Placental Nanovesicle Subpopulations in Obstetrical Diseases,10099051,R01HD103727,"['Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antiviral Response', 'Apoptotic', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Vessels', 'Bulla', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Field Flow Fractionation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Grant', 'Growth Factor', 'Growth and Development function', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Homeostasis', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lipoproteins', 'Location', 'MLLT2 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuscripts', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Biology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Uterus', 'Vesicle', 'Woman', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'first responder', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'liquid biopsy', 'microvesicles', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanosized', 'nanovesicle', 'new technology', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'response', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NICHD,MAGEE-WOMEN'S RES INST AND FOUNDATION,R01,2021,542123
"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of differenttypes of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by spatial context. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an extensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spatial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical. This project will work in close coordination with the HuBMAP consortium to help drive an ecosystem of useful resources for understanding and leveraging high-resolution human image data and to compile a human body atlas.","The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets",10397321,OT2OD026671,"['Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cataloging', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Ecosystem', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human BioMolecular Atlas Program', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Maps', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Organ', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Tissues', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'data exploration', 'data standards', 'design', 'human imaging', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'tool', 'vector']",OD,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,OT2,2021,1500000
"The Metadata Powerwash - Integrated tools to make biomedical data FAIR Project Summary  The metadata that describe scientific data are fundamental resources to enable (1) the discovery and reuse of the data and (2) the reproducibility of the experiments that generated the data in the first place. Metadata are essential for scientists to understand the associated data and to reuse them, as well as for information technology to index the data, to make the data available, and to provide filters for scientists to search for the corresponding datasets. Currently, the scientific metadata hosted in public repositories suffer from multiple quality issues that limit scientists’ ability to find and reuse the experimental datasets to which they refer. It can take many weeks of a scientist’s time to identify a collection of datasets that fulfill specific criteria when the data are so poorly described—and the majority of the process is necessarily manual.  We propose to develop an end-to-end solution to standardize biomedical metadata with the help of ontologies—data structures that define the terms in an application domain and the relationships among them. There are hundreds of ontologies that provide standard terms for use in biomedicine, and they are essential resources to make biomedical metadata interoperable and reusable. Our approach also will build on the technology created by the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR), which offers a library of building blocks and common data elements for defining computer-based metadata templates based on community standards.  Our plan involves three specific aims. First, we will develop a method and tool to standardize the multiple, ad hoc metadata field names that may appear in metadata to represent the same type of information by replacing those field names with the field names used in standard metadata templates or, if no appropriate template match is available, with terms from a relevant ontology. Second, we will develop methods and tools to standardize different types of metadata field values, for example, categorical values such as drugs or diseases, and numerical values such as age, or sample collection date. Third, we will evaluate the speed, precision, and recall of our metadata transformation pipeline—built out of the methods and tools to standardize field names and values—on a large corpus of metadata that we will manually curate based on existing public metadata. We will also carry out experiments to test the effect of the standardized metadata when biomedical scientists perform dataset search in the context of their work. Project Narrative Data that offer precise descriptions of data—metadata—are critical scientific resources that facilitate the discovery, reuse, and reproducibility of the data to which they refer. Our goal is to create methods and tools that improve the quality of scientific metadata hosted in public repositories, and thus enhance the discoverability and re-use of public biomedical datasets. Making data more accessible through scientifically rigorous metadata will accelerate the ability to make transformative data-driven biomedical discoveries using public data archives.",The Metadata Powerwash - Integrated tools to make biomedical data FAIR,10093841,R01LM013498,"['Age', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Categories', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'FAIR principles', 'Funding Agency', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numerical value', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'data archive', 'data repository', 'data reuse', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'metadata standards', 'public repository', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'search engine', 'secondary analysis', 'tool']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,334847
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,10178076,R01HL140362,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Environment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Height', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intensive Care Units', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nurses', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'community setting', 'complex data', 'computer science', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'lung injury', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'respiratory', 'response', 'theories', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2021,680901
"University of Buffalo Clinical and Translational Science Institute Contact PD/PI: Murphy, Timothy F The Buffalo Translational Consortium (BTC), which includes the University at Buffalo (UB) health sciences schools, the major healthcare institutions in our region, four key research institutes and five influential community partners, have embarked on a comprehensive strategic plan to build a strong foundation for clinical and translational research in response to our community needs. Buffalo is the second most populous city in New York State and has a rich cultural history. The proportion of underrepresented minorities in Buffalo in 2018 (50%) parallels that projected for the US in 2050, making Buffalo a microcosm of what the US will look like in 30 years. A similar proportion of our population experiences health disparities. The vision for our CTSA hub is to perform innovative research across the translational spectrum to improve the health of our community and the nation. We will develop, test and share novel approaches to engage difficult-to-engage populations and reduce health disparities in our community, which represents a “population of the future”. Guided by our vision, the CTSA has catalyzed a transformation of our environment since our CTSA was first funded in August 2015 with remarkable growth in clinical and translational research. Further, in just the past year, the UB medical school has moved into a spectacular new building and our clinical partner, Kaleida Health, the largest healthcare system in the region, opened the new Oishei Children’s Hospital, both on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and connected to the Clinical and Translational Research Center devoted entirely to clinical and translational research that opened in 2012. This rapid and continuing trajectory of growth in healthcare and research in the region has resulted in a new 21st century Academic Health Center with healthcare, medical education and clinical and translational research on one campus in the heart of Buffalo, creating a foundation to enhance the impact of our CTSA even further. While launching our CTSA, we have prioritized participation in the national consortium through hosting and testing Innovation Labs as a team science tool, working with multiple hubs on initiatives to solve translational research barriers and sharing tools that we have developed with the CTSA consortium, including novel health informatics tools. Our CTSA has five ambitious but achievable aims, including: 1) Accelerate innovative translational research with teams that engage communities, regional stakeholders and the national consortium; 2) Train an excellent, diverse workforce to advance translation of discoveries; 3) Enhance inclusion of special populations across the lifespan and difficult-to-engage populations; 4) Streamline clinical research processes focusing on quality and efficiency with emphasis on multisite studies; 5) Develop, test and share biomedical informatics tools to integrate data from multiple sources to speed translation. Guided by our vision to perform research to improve the health of our community and the nation, we will continue our momentum to expand translational research, train our diverse workforce, streamline processes, engage our community, and actively contribute to the national consortium.

"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,10093973,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38255
"Meta-analysis in human brain mapping This is the competing renewal of the R01 (MH074457-14) which sustains the BrainMap Project (www.brainmap.org). BrainMap is a neuroimaging research resource facilitating cognitive neuroscience and disease-biomarker discovery via coordinate-based meta-analysis (CBMA). BrainMap provides its end-user community with: curated 3-D coordinate data and experimental metadata from peer-reviewed publications; extensively validated computational tools for CBMA; CBMA-derived tools for data interpretation (e.g., functional property and disease loadings by location) and data analysis (e.g., via CBMA-derived disease models); instructional materials and on-site and on-line venues for learning CBMA methods; and, on-going end-user support. At present, BrainMap.org hosts two coordinate-based databases: task-activation (TA DB) and voxel- based morphometry (VBM DB). A voxel-based physiology database (VBP DB) is in the planning and piloting phase. BrainMap maintains an integrated pipeline of cross-platform (Java) tools for data coding (Scribe), filtered retrieval (Sleuth), activation-likelihood estimation (ALE) CBMA (GingerALE), data visualization (Mango), and data interpretation (CBMA-derived Mango plugins). Multiple network-modeling approaches have been successfully applied to BrainMap data – independent components analysis (ICA), author-topic modeling (ATM), graph-theory modeling (GTM), structural equation modeling (SEM), connectivity-based parcellation (CBP), and meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) – but none are yet optimized and “pipelined” for general use. Utilization of BrainMap resources is substantial: our software, data and meta-data have been used in >1,000 peer-reviewed articles. Of these, > 500 were published in the current funding cycle (2015- 2020). Four aims are proposed, to maintain and extend this high-impact research resource.  Aim 1.

"A novel technology to assess chronic toxicity in genetically diverse nematode populations Project Abstract The number of new products such as drugs, cosmetics and food additives introduced into the market is growing and poses a significant challenge for risk prediction. Currently, vertebrate testing is the industry standard for hazard assessment but has limitations including high costs, and the growing public and corporate sentiment against using vertebrates for chemical testing. Importantly, current toxicity assessment does not incorporate genetic diversity leading to failure of drug candidates and unintended risks to human sub-populations. The celebrated invertebrate model C. elegans has the potential to fill this gap since thousands of genetically diverse nematode populations are available. However, the main challenge is that chronic studies of chemicals in the nematode model is still tedious, precluding large-scale toxicity testing in nematode populations. This proposal aims to develop a high-throughput technology for chronic toxicity screening of diverse genetic populations in adult C. elegans. The focus of our Phase I plan is to pursue chronic toxicity studies on select toxins and generate foundational data highlighting the impact of genetic diversity, and subsequently scale the NemaLife technology to enable large-scale genetic diversity screening. AIM 1: To generate chronic dose-response data on toxins affecting diverse C. elegans strains. We will test the effects of five toxins for which we know the variability in human and rodent responses. Animals will be exposed to toxins daily, followed by scoring of survival, reproductive and neuromuscular health. About 1200 whole-life assays will be conducted with data acquired on 500+ animals per assay condition. We will generate data that will define the rank-order of C. elegans toxin response vis-à-vis mammalian systems, optimize phenotyping conditions for large numbers of strains per species, and define the amount of heritable variation in toxin responses. These pilot data will validate the capabilities afforded by our screening platform. AIM 2: To scale the throughput of NemaLife Technology for thousands of chronic toxicity assays. Currently, NemaLife’s technology has a throughput of hundreds of chronic toxicity assays. However, given the large number of toxins and vast library of genetic strains and wild isolates available, there is a significant need to increase the throughput of our technology. Therefore, we will develop the technology infrastructure and workflow to scale the throughput which includes multiplexing our approach, scale-up of chip fabrication and streamlining data analysis. Technology development at the scale of thousands of whole-life toxicity assays in a few weeks with readouts on animal death and neuromuscular impairments will be a major breakthrough in the field opening up new business opportunities in toxicity testing in the drug and consumer industry. Project Narrative Non-parasitic nematodes offer a powerful in vivo model to scale and measure toxin responses in genetically diverse species anchoring a transformative means to bridge current gaps in predictive toxicology with clinically-relevant end points.

"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.

"Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks to develop a resource for the preservation of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This insect is a foundational model organism for biological research. Over a century of work, an enormous number of fly strains harboring different mutant alleles or transgenic constructs have been generated. However, one limitation of working with flies is that there is as yet no practical method for cryopreservation of Drosophila strains. Conventional methods of vitrifying Drosophila were developed in the early 1990s and were never widely adopted due to the difficulty in performing the protocols. This is a problem from a practical perspective since all these strains need to be individually maintained in continuous culture at substantial cost and labor, and also from a scientific perspective, since in the process of continuous culture mutations can accumulate and contamination can occur, degrading the value of these resources for future experiments. A novel approach for cryopreservation of Drosophila is proposed for this R24 resource center. Isolated embryonic nuclei, rather than intact embryos, will be cryopreserved and then nuclear transplantation via microinjection will be used to create clones derived from the cryopreserved nuclei. This approach avoids the issues associated with the impermeability of embryonic membranes that have prevented the use of conventional cryopreservation approaches that have been used with other organisms. Embryonic nuclei will be cryopreserved using a naturally inspired approach. Diverse biological systems (plants, insects, etc.) survive dehydration, drought, freezing temperatures and other stresses through the use of osmolytes. On an applied level, the proposed investigation has the potential to transform preservation of Drosophila lines by 1) preserving subcellular components (specifically nuclei) as opposed to embryos; and 2) automating much of the workflow. In the long- term, the goal of this resource center is to develop a robust and scalable protocol for cryopreservation of Drosophila, thus reducing the cost and improving the quality of long-term strain maintenance. PROJECT NARRATIVE The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is a very important model organism for biomedical research. The goal of this resource center is to develop effective methods of preserving fruit flies in order to lower the costs and improve the quality of stock maintenance. The approach leverages recent scientific advances to develop a new, highly automated approach for preserving fruit flies.",Development of a novel method for cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster,10160982,R24OD028444,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Droughts', 'Embryo', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Microinjections', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organism', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'biological research', 'biological systems', 'cold temperature', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'individual response', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear transfer', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'tool']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R24,2021,575125
"Digital Melt Curve Analysis Platform for Longitudinal Cancer Patient Monitoring Abstract  Building on its commercially available Absolute Q digital PCR platform, during the 24-month Phase 2 SBIR project, Combinati will complete the development of the first Digital Melt Curve Analysis (DMCA) platform to the market to further advance the adoption of digital genomics for highly accurate, sensitive and reproducible nucleic acid quantification for longitudinal patient monitoring. To provide the “whole product” solution and prove the function, we will demonstrate the DMCA platform with Luminex’s 11- plex ESR1 (Estrogen Receptor 1) assay and conduct Beta testing at Dana Farber Cancer Institute: 1. Three beta instruments and the analysis software capable of digital melt curve analysis. 2. Complete dMCA validation internally with commercially available melt calibration kits. 3. Demonstrate <0.1% Mutation Allele Frequency of 11 cell-free DNA targets using Luminex  Corporation’s discrete melt assay. 4. Beta testing at Dana Farber Cancer Institute Narrative  Since PCR was invented back in 1983, it has become the gold standard for applications requiring quantification of nucleic acids. The continuous evolution of the technology enables PCR to be more quantitative (qPCR), more accurate, precise and reproducible (digital PCR). In parallel, with the invention of melt curve analysis in 1997, it opens another dimension in melt temperatures for applications requiring simple and inexpensive genotyping, high degree qualitative multiplexing without sequencing, and assay optimization. Despite that there is a handful of dPCR platforms in the market, none of them supports Melt Curve Analysis. By combining melt curve analysis with digital PCR, Combinati strives to accelerate the adoption of digital genomics for all nucleic acid quantification needs in research and clinical markets.",Digital Melt Curve Analysis Platform for Longitudinal Cancer Patient Monitoring,10256226,R44CA261523,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Blinded', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'ESR1 gene', 'Evolution', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Mainstreaming', 'Manuscripts', 'Mechanics', 'Memory', 'Metastatic breast cancer', 'Microfluidics', 'Monitor', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Optics', 'Oranges', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Speed', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'cell free DNA', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'cyanine dye 5', 'data exchange', 'design', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'fluorescence imaging', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'invention', 'lens', 'liquid biopsy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'melting', 'multidimensional data', 'mutant', 'mutation assay', 'neural network', 'product development', 'sensor', 'simulation']",NCI,"COMBINATI, INC.",R44,2021,772720
"Shape Analysis Toolbox: From medical images to quantitative insights of anatomy PROJECT SUMMARY Three-dimensional shape lies at the core of understanding the physical objects that surround us. The Shape AnaLysis Toolbox (SALT) was created to be a dissemination vehicle for advanced shape modeling and analysis methodology as an open-source, comprehensive and freely distributed software. Over the past four years, we have been successful in increasing the ease of use and effectiveness of state-of-the-art shape analysis methodology for biomedical researchers in need of such techniques. We now propose necessary and novel enhancements to our methods and our dissemination model in order to continue maximizing the success of SALT. We will also modify the architecture of SALT to better integrate biomedical imaging research workflows by improving the efficiency and scripting capabilities so SlicerSALT can be deployed in batch mode for large-scale sequential computations. We will also shift our focus from shape modeling into state-of-the-art statistical shape analysis methodologies, necessary to serve clinical applications and to increase the interpretability of shape biomarkers. We will continue to disseminate novel example applications that best demonstrate how to use our tools to perform impactful research and will provide fully digital documentation for user support. The ultimate goal of SlicerSALT is to maximize the potential benefits of the geometric information contained in medical data and to expand its use beyond simple visualization to support clinical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Slicer Shape AnaLysis Toolbox (SALT) was developed as an open-source, free comprehensive software that allows biomedical scientists to precisely locate shape changes in their imaging studies. This proposal is designed to increase the continued success of SALT by recognizing that shape models and dynamic anatomical changes are challenging to interpret despite quantification of the geometry of physical objects. We will address this need by incorporating state-of-the-art and interpretable shape statistics methodology into SALT and new driving biological problems to illustrate their utility while continuing to provide effective user support.",Shape Analysis Toolbox: From medical images to quantitative insights of anatomy,10426508,R56EB021391,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical scientist', 'clinical application', 'complex data', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy evaluation', 'fetal', 'geometric structure', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'longitudinal analysis', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site']",NIBIB,"KITWARE, INC.",R56,2021,436264
"Consortium for Immunotherapeutics against Emerging Viral Threats SUMMARY: OVERALL  This proposal, Consortium for Immunotherapeutics Against Emerging Viral Diseases, addresses a critical gap in the biodefense portfolio by building an academic-industry partnership to advance effective, fully human, antibody-based immunotherapeutics against three major families of emerging/re-emerging viruses: Lassa virus, Ebola and other Filoviruses, and mosquito-transmitted Alphaviruses that threaten millions worldwide. This program follows directly from our significant body of preliminary data (the largest available for these families of viruses), therapeutics in hand, multidisciplinary expertise, and demonstrated collaborative success. Included in the proposed CETR portfolio are: (1) the only available immunotherapeutics against endemic Lassa virus, with reversal of late-stage disease and complete survival in infected non-human primates, (2) novel Ebola and pan- ebolavirus therapeutics that also completely protect non-human primates from disease, and that were built by the paradigm-shifting and comprehensive analysis of a global consortium, and (3) much needed, first-in-class therapeutics against the re-emerging alphaviruses that have tremendous epidemic potential in the United States and around the globe. These multidisciplinary studies, founded upon pioneering structural biology of the antigen targets, include innovations such as agnostic, high-throughput Fc profiling and optimization, coupled with Fv evolution to enhance potency and developability, as well as a sophisticated statistical and computational analysis core to evaluate thresholds and correlates of protection across the major families of pathogens. Together, we aim to understand what findings represent general rules and what data are specific to each virus family. We also aim to provide streamlined systems for antibody choice and optimization that do not yet exist, and to build a broadly applicable platform for mAb discovery and delivery against any novel pathogen as they emerge. The recent resurgence of Lassa, the epidemic nature of Ebola virus and other re-emerging filoviruses, as well as the major population at risk by global movement of mosquito-borne alphaviruses together demonstrate the tremendous global need for immunotherapeutics developed and advanced by this program. NARRATIVE Three major families of emerging viruses (Lassa and other arenaviruses, Ebola and other filoviruses, and mosquito-borne alphaviruses) threaten human health worldwide, but lack approved therapeutics or vaccines. The proposed multidisciplinary consortium, an academic-industry partnership, will advance safe and effective, fully human, monoclonal antibody therapies against these viruses, using candidate therapies that confer complete protection in non-human primates as our starting point.

"AUGS/DUKE UrogynCREST program PROJECT SUMMARY Health Services Research (HSR) and predictive analytics are rapidly growing fields and will have enormous implications for women’s health research in pelvic floor disorders (PFDs). The AUGS/DUKE Urogynecology Clinical Research Educational Scientist Training (UrogynCREST) program will prepare participants to recognize the critical role that data play in delivering high quality health care. It brings together expertise in health service and women’s health research, medical informatics and prediction modeling. This program will target Urogynecology Faculty at the Assistant Professor level who seek successful careers in health services research (HSR) and analytics. Participants will obtain skills through a combination of didactic and interactive coursework; hands-on manipulation of data through extraction, cleaning, and analysis; and project-based one on one mentoring. The UrogynCREST program will be an interactive, hands-on educational program with centralized activities organized and delivered by distance through a popular on-line learning platform called Sakai, with educational software designed to support teaching, research and collaboration. A diverse faculty with expertise in data sciences teaches courses and the advanced methodology required to perform HSR. Yearly in-person meetings at the annual American Urogynecologic Society meeting enhance networking and the development of partnerships between participants from various institutions, as well as, interactions with the mentors and other HSR in the field. The program’s strategy allows national leaders with particular skills in the field to provide their knowledge to the participants and help mentor them through development of a relevant research question and identification of an appropriate and existing database(s) to address the question. With the guidance of a dedicated statistician and analyst programmer, participants will learn and perform the necessary computer programming needed to extract, clean and analyze these data. Participants whose projects involve the development of prediction models in the form of scores, nomograms or other tools will learn how to build and validate such tools in the existing project. Each participant’s project will culminate in the completion of a submitted manuscript to a peer- reviewed journal or study proposal and publicly available tools when relevant. Overall, the program will shape future scientific leaders in Urogynecology by encouraging the development of clinical-scientists and provide the skills and resources for invigorating data discovery and tools for investigations in HSR specifically addressing (PFDs).

"Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Modeling the Incompleteness and Biases of Health Data Researchers are increasingly working to “mine” health data to derive new medical knowledge. Unlike experimental data that are collected per a research protocol, the primary role of clinical data is to help clinicians care for patients, so the procedures for its collection are not often systematic. Thus, missing and/or biased data can hinder medical knowledge discovery and data mining efforts. Existing efforts for missing health data imputation often focus on only cross-sectional correlation (e.g., correlation across subjects or across variables) but neglect autocorrelation (e.g., correlation across time points). Moreover, they often focus on modeling incompleteness but neglect the biases in health data. Modeling both the incompleteness and bias may contribute to better understanding of health data and better support clinical decision making. We propose a novel framework of Bias-Aware Missing data Imputation with Cross-sectional correlation and Autocorrelation (BAMICA), and leverage clinical notes to better inform the methods that will otherwise rely on structured health data only. In addition to evaluating its imputation accuracy, we will apply the proposed framework to assist in downstream tasks such as predictive modeling for multiple outcomes across a diverse range of clinical and cohort study datasets. Aim 1 introduces the MICA framework to jointly consider cross-sectional correlation and auto-correlation. In Aim 2, we will augment MICA to be bias-aware (hence BAMICA) to account for biases stemmed from multiple roots such as healthcare process and use them as features in imputing missing health data. This augmentation is achieved by a novel recurrent neural network architecture that keeps track of both evolution of health data variables and bias factors. In Aim 3, we will supplement unstructured clinical notes to structured health data for modeling incompleteness and biases using a novel architecture of graph neural network on top of memory network. We will apply graph neural networks to process clinical notes in order to learn proper representations as input to the memory networks for imputation and downstream predictive modeling tasks. Depending on the clinical problem and data availability, not all modules may be needed. Thus our proposed BAMICA framework is designed to be flexible and consists of selectable modules to meet some or all of the above needs. In summary, our proposal bridges a key knowledge gap in jointly modeling incompleteness and biases in health data and utilizes unstructured clinical notes to supplement and augment such modeling in order to better support predictive modeling and clinical decision making. We will demonstrate generalizability by experimenting on four large clinical and cohort study datasets, and by scaling up to the eMERGE network spanning 11 institutions nationwide. We will disseminate the open-source framework. The principled and flexible framework generated by this project will bring significant methodological advancement and have a direct impact on enhancing discovery from health data.

"Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation Project Summary/Abstract: With the surge of large genomics data, there is an immense increase in the breadth and depth of different omics datasets and an increasing importance in the topic of privacy of individuals in genomic data science. Detailed genetic and environmental characterization of diseases and conditions relies on the large-scale mining of functional genomics data; hence, there is great desire to share data as broadly as possible. However, there is a scarcity of privacy studies focused on such data. A key first step in reducing private information leakage is to measure the amount of information leakage in functional genomics data, particularly in different data file types. To this end, we propose to to derive information-theoretic measures for private information leakage in different data types from functional genomics data. We will also develop various file formats to reduce this leakage during sharing. We will approach the privacy analysis under three aims. First, we will develop statistical metrics that can be used to quantify the sensitive information leakage from raw reads. We will systematically analyze how linking attacks can be instantiated using various genotyping methods such as single nucleotide variant and structural variant calling from raw reads, signal profiles, Hi-C interaction matrices, and gene expression matrices. Second, we will study different algorithms to implement privacy-preserving transformations to the functional genomics data in various forms. Particularly, we will create privacy-preserving file formats for raw sequence alignment maps, signal track files, three-dimensional interaction matrices, and gene expression quantification matrices that contain information from multiple individuals. This will allow us to study the sources of sensitive information leakages other than raw reads, for example signal profiles, splicing and isoform transcription, and abnormal three-dimensional genomic interactions. Third, we will investigate the reads that can be mapped to the microbiome in the raw human functional genomics datasets. We will use inferred microbial information to characterize private information about individuals, and then combine the microbial information with the information from human mapped reads to increase the re-identification accuracy in the linking attacks described in the second aim. We will use the tools to quantify the sensitive information and privacy-preserving file formats in the available datasets from large sequencing projects, such as the ENCODE, The Cancer Genome Atlas, 1,000 Genomes, gEUVADIS, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. Project Narrative: Sharing large-scale functional genomics data is critical for scientific discovery, but comes with important privacy concerns related to the possible misuse of such data. This proposal will quantify and manage the rieslkasted to releasing functional genomics datasets, based on integrating inferred genotypes from the raw sequence files, signal tracks, and microbiome mapped sequences. Finally, we will develop file formats, statistical methodologies, and related software for anonymization of functional genomics data that enable open sharing.",Enhancing open data sharing for functional genomics experiments: Measures to quantify genomic information leakage and file formats for privacy preservation,10251876,R01HG010749,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biology', 'ChIP-seq', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Consent', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Extravasation', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Glean', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Splicing', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'human tissue', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'open data', 'privacy preservation', 'social', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,526482
"High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants Project Summary  Current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit several critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’ endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’ genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000 diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing services. Project Narrative Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that can be analyzed without the need for animal testing.

The success of regenerative therapies is dependent, at least in part, on a favorable microenvironment in which the regenerative processes occur. Technological innovations and a deepened mechanistic understanding of how these microenvironmental signals influence tissue regeneration has drawn attention to the critical importance of the clinical field with foundations in the application of physical, thermal, and electrical stimuli to promote functional restoration—rehabilitation. We propose that the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitative science are inextricably intertwined, an intersection of disciplines that we and others have termed Regenerative Rehabilitation. To realize the full potential of Regenerative Rehabilitation, there is a need for formalized mechanisms that promote the interaction of basic scientists with rehabilitation specialists. During the initial funding cycle, the Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) built a national network of investigators and programs that has helped to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies across the domains of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation. This proposal seeks funding for AR3T 2.0, in which we will build on successes achieved and lessons learned over the initial period of support with the goal of being even more responsive to the needs of the greater community. Six specific aims define a framework upon which we will achieve our goals. AR3T will provide education and drive the science underlying Regenerative Rehabilitation by: 1) Providing didactic programs that expose rehabilitation researchers to cutting-edge investigations and state-of-the-art technologies in the field of regenerative medicine (Didactic Aim); 2) Cultivating collaborative opportunities between renowned investigators in the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation (Collaborations Aim); 3) Coordinating a pilot funding program to support novel lines of Regenerative Rehabilitation research (Pilot Funding Aim); 4) Developing and validating technologies to advance the measurement and use of the regenerative rehabilitation programs (Technology Aim); 5) Promoting our center’s expertise to a broad community of trainees, investigators, and clinicians (Promotion Aim); 6) Carefully monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our program will ensure that we are successful in achieving our goals (Quality Control Aim). Administrative note: In the preparation of this proposal, we made every effort to present a comprehensive and detailed plan for achieving our goals while minimizing redundancy. Therefore, in multiple places, we refer the reader to specific components of the application, rather than repeating text. We appreciate the time and effort the reviewers devote to the evaluation of the proposals.  Sincerely, Fabrisia, Tom and Mike PROJECT NARRATIVE  Regenerative Rehabilitation is the integration of principles and approaches across the fields of rehabilitation science and regenerative medicine. The integration of these two fields will increase the efficiency of interventions designed to optimize physical functioning to the benefit of a wide range of individuals with disabilities.

"The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease Most investigations of craniosynostosis focus on the dermatocranium, the second cranial skeleton to form during embryogenesis that comprises the dermal bones of the cranial vault and facial skeleton. A completely separate cranial skeleton, the chondrocranium, develops before the dermatocranium to support the embryonic brain and other sense organs. Historically, the chondrocranium has been studied across the vertebrates and is recognized as fundamental to craniofacial development, but it is not well known to craniofacial biologists and has never been studied in the laboratory mouse until now. The chondrocranium is formed of cartilage and though parts of it ossify endochondrally, other portions begin to degenerate by about embryonic day 15-16 in the mouse. By careful analysis of whole mount and histological specimens, we have documented the synchronized deterioration of select chondrocranial elements with the appearance and superimposition of particular dermal bones of the growing dermatocranium. These observations signal the existence of a mechanism for the coordinated, localized expansion (dermal bones) and resorption (cartilage) of two developmentally and evolutionarily separate skeletal systems. Our project, supported by strong preliminary data of the mouse chondrocranium, is designed to test a central hypothesis: that the chondrocranium serves as a structural and functional scaffold for the later development of dermatocranial elements including the formation of cranial vault sutures. Based on the common finding that boundaries between different cell populations often serve as tissue organizers, we recognize the establishment and maintenance of stable boundaries that restrict the mixing of different cell populations as critical to proper development, and propose a research design that interrogates the chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundary as significant to the coordinated development of the skull. We will interrogate cells at specific sites to determine the processes that function to maintain the boundaries. Then using the Fgfr2c+/C342Y mouse model for craniosynostosis, we will investigate relevant chondrocranial/dermatocranial boundaries operative in the development of two craniosynostosis phenotypes: premature closure of the coronal suture and abnormal growth of the midface. That the chondrocranium is composed of irregularly shaped cartilages, many of which are short-lived, requires that we conceive new tools for analysis. We will complete development of an innovative system to dissect and reconstruct the chondrocranium in silico from micro computed tomography images with tight temporal control, precisely delineate chondrocranial anatomy in 3D over embryonic time, and establish the role of the chondrocranium in development of the dermatocranium. Achieving our goals will enrich textbook knowledge of craniofacial development by defining the role of the chondrocranium in the production of dermatocranial phenotypes, provide information relative to the pathophysiology of countless craniofacial anomalies, and reveal potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutics. Craniofacial anomalies are common birth defects that require comprehensive, sometimes repetitive corrective surgeries to manage individual cases. To ameliorate the financial and emotional burden on patients and their families, efforts are aimed at the development of preventative therapies but these require a thorough understanding of craniofacial development. We offer novel information about the chondrocranium, the first embryonic cranial skeleton to develop, and focus on mechanisms operating within boundaries between it and the dermatocranium that are critical to craniofacial development, in normal individuals and in craniofacial disease.",The chondrocranium in craniofacial development and disease,10087916,R01DE027677,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Apert-Crouzon syndrome', 'Apoptosis', 'Appearance', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Bone Resorption', 'Brain', 'Cartilage', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Chondrichthyes', 'Chondrocranium', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Craniofacial Abnormalities', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Embryonic Structures', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Face', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory mice', 'Live Birth', 'Maintenance', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Osteoblasts', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Sense Organs', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal system', 'Skeleton', 'Staging System', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'bone', 'cleft lip and palate', 'coronal suture', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial development', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'design', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 2c', 'histological specimens', 'imaging Segmentation', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'microCT', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'osteogenic', 'premature', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIDCR,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2021,495785

"Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines ABSTRACT Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines have shown excellent safety and vaccine efficacy (VE) in more than 25 clinical trials in Africa, Europe, and the US; Phase 3 assessment will begin in mid-2020. Our goal during the next decade is to develop, license, and deploy next generation SPZ vaccines with increased breadth, magnitude, and/or durability of VE and decreased cost of goods. Current assays and animal models do not offer an alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating whether a vaccine candidate exhibits superior performance to current SPZ vaccines. In this project we aim to develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate a vaccine recipient will be protected against Pf malaria by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines. Success could come from increased understanding of the 1) immunological effector mechanisms of protective immunity (PI), 2) antigenic targets of PI, and/or 3) organs and cells involved in induction of the PI. Despite many studies, our understanding of these 3 areas has only modestly improved in the last 2 decades. In 2000 it was hypothesized that antigen-specific, tissue resident CD8+ T cells in the liver that recognized Pf peptides bound to class I HLA molecules on the surface of Pf-infected hepatocytes were the key cells mediating PI. This hypothesis led to a seminal study that demonstrated subcutaneous administration of PfSPZ Vaccine did not lead to induction of PfSPZ-specific, CD8+ T cells in the livers of immunized NHPs, but intravenous (IV) administration did. Based in large part on these results, a clinical trial of IV administration was initiated, and the trial showed 100% VE. Subsequently, >25 clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines have shown that empirical alteration of PfSPZ/dose, number of doses, interval between doses, and method of attenuation can improve performance of PfSPZ vaccines. However, we have learned little about mechanisms and targets of PI, or the tissues involved in induction of PI. We believe this is because the effector activity takes place in the liver, and induction of PI also takes place in the central compartment, which is inaccessible in humans. Since our last major advance came from studying the livers of immunized NHPs, we think much more information can be gleaned from this approach, including elucidation of immunological effectors and targets, and comparison and down-selection of vaccine candidates. Therefore, in this project we will develop 3 models in outbred NHPs to study SPZ vaccine-induced immunity, and use the data generated in the models and systems biology assays to establish biomarkers and groups of assays (signature) that consistently predict whether a NHP will be protected, and establish blood surrogates of tissue markers. The best assays/ biomarkers/signatures will be assessed using serum, plasma, and PBMCs from protected/unprotected subjects assessed in clinical trials of PfSPZ vaccines. Finally, we will use the assays/biomarkers/signatures and model systems to screen newly developed SPZ vaccines, especially genetically altered vaccines, to down-select which should move to process development and clinical testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Malaria affects over two billion people, killing over 400,000 individuals each year mostly children in Africa. A powerful tool is needed for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum malaria from defined geographical areas. The ideal tool would be a highly effective, long-acting vaccine that prevents infection, and thereby disease and parasite transmission. There is currently no alternative to clinical trials for demonstrating that a vaccine candidate exhibits performance superior to current SPZ vaccines Therefore, in this project we will develop in vitro assays and/or non-human primate (NHP) models that indicate if a human will be protected against Pf infection by a SPZ vaccine, and use them to show superiority of new SPZ vaccines.",Development of Non-Human Primate Models to Assess Immunological Mechanisms and Antigenic Targets of Protective Sporozoite (SPZ) Vaccines and Establish Superior Efficacy of Next Generation SPZ vaccines,10086740,U01AI155354,"['Affect', 'Africa', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Aotus primate', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Erythrocytes', 'Europe', 'Exhibits', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Geographic Locations', 'Germany', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Interferons', 'Interleukin-12', 'Intravenous', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Liver', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Malaria', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Organ', 'Parasites', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium falciparum vaccine', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Radiation', 'Regimen', 'Safety', 'Seminal', 'Serum', 'Spleen', 'Sporozoite vaccine', 'Sporozoites', 'Statistical Models', 'Surface', 'Systems Biology', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'asexual', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'cost', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'lymph nodes', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'protective efficacy', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'subcutaneous', 'success', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'vaccine candidate', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine efficacy', 'vaccine-induced immunity', 'volunteer']",NIAID,"SANARIA, INC.",U01,2021,942943
"Modeling to Design Treatments for Idiopathic Lung Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY Every year in this country 40,000 patients are diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and terminal disease caused by excessive extracellular matrix production by myofibroblasts in distributed lesions, or “fibrotic foci”, throughout the lung. Despite the availability of two FDA-approved drugs that are considered standard of care, the mortality rate for IPF patients exceeds 30% at four years, and there are no drugs that halt disease progression, making diagnosis with IPF a death sentence for over 500,000 Americans living with this disease. Identifying the cells of origin that give rise to myofibroblasts is necessary for finding treatments that can halt or cure IPF. Based on experimental data and computational simulations from our research team, we hypothesize that myofibroblasts arise from microvascular pericytes (cells that normally enwrap capillaries) when heterotypic pericyte-endothelial interactions become disrupted. We further posit that strategic modulation of kinase-mediated signaling in pericytes can prevent pericyte-to-myofibroblast transitions and halt the progression of IPF. We propose to combine computational modeling with experiments to study pericyte-to-myofibroblast differentiation and to investigate how microvessel adaptations in the lung contribute to IPF. Specifically, we will develop a new agent-based model (ABM) that incorporates logic-based intracellular signaling networks to simulate cell behaviors and leverages Bayesian inference for rule refinement (Aim 1), validate the ABM's ability to predict pericyte phenotype transitions and the emergence of fibrotic foci in response to drugs using the murine bleomycin model of IPF (Aim 2), and bridge murine experiments with clinical data in order to predict how druggable kinase-driven signaling pathways affect IPF progression via modulation of pericytes and microvessels (Aim 3). To our knowledge, our proposed studies will be the first to combine computational modeling with experiments to study microvascular contributors to IPF progression. In addition to producing a new computational model that is validated for bridging pre-clinical study results to clinical outcomes, we expect to identify new therapeutic approaches for IPF that target microvascular cells, previously underexplored but potentially critical contributors to this deadly disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a deadly disease caused by uncontrolled tissue fibrosis in the lungs. There are no FDA-approved drugs that cure or prevent disease progression. We propose to combine computational modeling with experiments study how fibroblasts and microvessel remodeling in the lung contribute to disease and to identify novel drugs and drug combinations that target these processes in order to effectively treat IPF.",Modeling to Design Treatments for Idiopathic Lung Fibrosis,10305193,R01HL155143,"['Affect', 'Alveolar', 'American', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Bleomycin', 'Blood capillaries', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Country', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FDA approved', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Harvest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Lesion', 'Logic', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Myofibroblast', 'Nature', 'New Agents', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Pirfenidone', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tamoxifen', 'Terminal Disease', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'To specify', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'experimental study', 'human data', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'pulmonary agents', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'skeletal', 'standard of care', 'therapy design', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,548214
"Metabolic Basis of Bacterial Community Function in the Cystic Fibrosis Airway Abstract. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disease characterized by overproduction of mucus in the lungs followed by chronic lung infections. Conventional wisdom has been that most CF lung infections involve a single dominant organism, most commonly the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Advances in culture-independent techniques have revealed that CF lung infections are rarely mono-microbial and instead usually involve complex microbial communities, yet the interspecies interactions that drive these communities are poorly understood. Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that polymicrobial infections are more difficult than mono-microbial infections to eradicate with antibiotics, leading to the concept of recalcitrant communities. The mechanisms underlying recalcitrance are thought to involve synergistic interactions between community members, but very little data are available to understand this phenomenon. Combined with the realization that many CF patients respond poorly to available antibiotic regimens compels a more detailed understanding of interspecies interactions and their impacts on antibiotic recalcitrance to improve the treatment of CF infections, as well as other polymicrobial diseases. Here, we combine big-data bioinformatics, in silico computational modeling and in vitro culture experiments to gain insights into the metabolic interactions that drive CF disease outcomes and antibiotic recalcitrance. The research will leverage an available data set of hundreds of CF patient samples that provide both bacterial composition data and clinical metadata, including measures of lung function. These samples will be clustered according to their measured compositions and metabolic capabilities predicted through computational metabolic modeling to test the hypothesis that the vast complexity of these many bacterial communities can be collapsed into a small number of model communities that capture most of the observed metabolic variability. These computational predictions will be tested by developing in vitro cell culture models that recapitulate the most important metabolic features of the in vivo polymicrobial communities (Aim 1). By applying bioinformatics and modeling to the same clinical data, we will test the hypothesis that community metabolic features drive disease outcomes and the virulence potential of these communities (Aim 2). Finally, we will interrogate the clinical data and in vitro communities to test the hypothesis that community metabolic features drive antibiotic recalcitrance and differentiate community responsiveness to antibiotics according to these metabolic features (Aim 3). Our research will yield novel insights into how complex polymicrobial communities are compositionally structured, interact metabolically, contribute to disease and respond to antibiotics. Moreover, the research will validate in vitro models that offer the potential for development of novel antimicrobial strategies to better treat chronic, polymicrobial infections in CF and other diseases. Our transdisciplinary team offers the necessary expertise in bioinformatics, computational modeling, microbial physiology and CF polymicrobial infections to tackle this complex problem. Project Narrative: Infections associated with cystic fibrosis, and other polymicrobial infections, are still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Here we propose to apply bioinformatics, modeling and experimental tools to a large clinical data set to gain new insight into how to treat complex, chronic polymicrobial infections.",Metabolic Basis of Bacterial Community Function in the Cystic Fibrosis Airway,10293007,R01AI155424,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dose', 'Energy-Generating Resources', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Feeding Patterns', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic study', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Lung', 'Lung infections', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Physiology', 'Minimum Inhibitory Concentration measurement', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous body substance', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sputum', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'antibiotic tolerance', 'antimicrobial', 'antimicrobial drug', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cystic fibrosis airway', 'cystic fibrosis infection', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'polymicrobial biofilm', 'polymicrobial disease', 'pulmonary function', 'pulmonary function decline', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIAID,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,466513
"Computational Methods for Designing Optimal Genomics-guided Viral Diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract Viral genome sequencing is growing exponentially and cutting-edge molecular technologies, guided by genomic data, show great promise in detecting and responding to viruses. Yet we lack a computational framework that efficiently leverages viral data to design the nucleic or amino acid sequences applied by these technologies. The proposal provides a career development plan to (i) build computational techniques — algorithms, models, and software — that yield highly accurate diagnostic assays, with potential to outperform existing ones, and (ii) use the techniques to proactively design assays for detecting 1,000s of viruses. The project will first develop methods for designing optimal viral genome-informed diagnostics. The study will formulate objective functions that evaluate an assay’s performance across a distribution of anticipated viral targets. Combinatorial optimization algorithms and generative models, constructed in the study, will optimize the functions. The project will also develop datasets for training predictive models of assay performance, which are used in the objective functions, focusing on CRISPR-, amplification-, and antigen-based diagnostics. Preliminary experimental results suggest such models can render assays with exquisite sensitivity and specificity. The study will compare the algorithmically-designed assays to state-of-the-art tests for four viruses. With these methods, the project will design diagnostic assays that are species-specific and broadly effective across genomic diversity for all viruses known to infect vertebrates. The study will build a system to monitor the assays’ effectiveness against emerging viral genomic diversity and to continually update them as needed. To enable the broad adoption of these methods, the project will implement them efficiently in accessible software. The proposal aligns with a NIAID goal of improving diagnostics via data science. The methods developed here may also aid therapy and vaccine design, and will leave the world better prepared to combat viral outbreaks. The career development award will provide training for the candidate in applied areas of long-term interest to his career. The candidate has previous experience in developing computational methods and analyzing viral genomes. Through the award, he will gain new knowledge and skills in diagnostic applications, alongside formal and informal training in immunology, bioengineering, and related laboratory techniques. This training will help the candidate progress toward therapy and vaccine applications that could benefit from advanced computational methods. The Broad Institute provides a supportive environment for the candidate’s development, including career development workshops, research seminars aligned with the proposed plan, and opportunities to initiate collaborations with scientists having expertise complementary to the candidate’s. The research and training will help him form an independent research group focused on developing and applying computational methods to enable more effective microbial surveillance and response. Project Narrative Viral genomic data is reshaping how we prepare for and respond to viral threats, but there is a scarcity of computational techniques that harness this vast, ever-growing data for designing diagnostic assays. The project will develop and test algorithms, machine learning models, and software systems to efficiently design highly accurate diagnostic assays by optimizing well-defined objective functions, applied to multiple diagnostic technologies, and will build a resource of broadly effective diagnostic assays for 1,000s of viral species. The resource and software developed in the project will advance capabilities for detecting viruses, and the new methods may accommodate challenges in designing more effective viral therapies and vaccines.",Computational Methods for Designing Optimal Genomics-guided Viral Diagnostics,10284445,K01AI163498,"['2019-nCoV', 'Adoption', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dengue', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Focus Groups', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Immunology', 'Influenza', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Performance', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'ZIKA', 'accurate diagnostics', 'advanced analytics', 'antigen diagnostic', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'combat', 'computer framework', 'design', 'detection assay', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic technologies', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'microbial', 'model design', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'response', 'skills', 'software development', 'software systems', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'supportive environment', 'therapy design', 'viral genomics']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",K01,2021,129165
"A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing Project Summary: Neurotoxicological evaluation of new compounds intended for human use or of potential human exposure is mandated by international regulatory bodies and largely relies on lethality testing in higher-order vertebrate animals. High screening costs, long experimental times, and legislative requirements to reduce dependence on animal testing have led many industries to search for alternative technologies. In vitro toxicology testing uses isolated cells or monotypic cell culture and can only provide limited insight since these models lack biologically relevant intact multi-typic cellular network structures. While both technologies have been augmented by in silico technologies, there is still a non-trivial gap between what can be learned and translated from simple, fast, inexpensive in vitro methods versus longer, complex, and costly in vivo studies in higher order animals. Newormics’ approach to filling this gap is to enable in vivo neurotoxicological assessment in Caenorhabditis elegans, an accepted alternative invertebrate model organism, by developing neuron-specific toxicity assays, delivered via a proprietary high-density, large-scale microfluidic immobilization device for high-content, high throughput analysis. Building on advances made during Phase I and important market learnings from participation in the NIH I-Corps program, Phase II proposes several new elements of innovation to achieve our goals in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will convert our first-generation microfluidic device to a high-density (384- well) vivoChip with improved microfabrication technologies, incorporate on-chip culture for transfer-less exposure and testing, and integrate automation for chip loading, imaging, and analysis. These measures will significantly increase test scale (from 80 compounds per chip to 280) and lower the consumable and labor costs per test. In Aim 2, building on our dopaminergic neurotox assay from Phase I, we will develop four neurotox assays with brightly fluorescently labeled dopaminergic, serotonergic, GABAergic, and cholinergic neurons providing the unprecedented ability to assess subtle phenotypic effects of chemicals on individual intact, functional neurons. To achieve real-time image processing, multi-parameter phenotyping, and managing the terabytes of image data generated per test, we will build a computational platform empowered by a graphic user interface. This platform will be used for image compilation, user-annotated phenotype definition and scoring, and automated report generation with appropriate statistical analysis. In Aim 3, with our industry partners, we will validate our platform and assays using reference chemicals. As more chemicals are tested, we will build a database which can be further mined. The outcome of this work will enable many industries to reduce lethal animal testing and get safer industrial and personal consumer products to market faster for economic benefit, reaching regulatory compliance for reduced animal use, and improved healthcare for neurological diseases. Narrative: The proposed work will enable the use of a small invertebrate model organism, C. elegans, for neuron-specific analysis of neurodegeneration phenotypes from high-resolution fluorescence images of individual neurons at high throughputs. The proposed imaging system and the neuron-specific assays will provide an unprecedented ability to assess developmental neurotoxicity in an intact, live, whole organism, down to a neuronal mechanism- of-action level. This project will fill the gap between in vitro and in vivo toxicology testing with an effective invertebrate model organism as alternate to vertebrate animal testing.",A Multiwell Plate Format Microfluidic Immobilization Chip for High-Content Imaging of Whole Animals for in vivoNeurotoxicology Testing,10202460,R44MH118841,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dendrites', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dopamine', 'Eating', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gel', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immobilization', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Innovation Corps', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Market Research', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research Activity', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Serotonin', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Toxicology', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Organism', 'Work', 'base', 'cholinergic neuron', 'computational platform', 'connectome', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'density', 'design', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'developmental toxicity', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'fluorescence imaging', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'graphical user interface', 'high resolution imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'imaging platform', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vitro Model', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotoxicity', 'neurotoxicology', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'reproductive toxicity', 'screening', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'terabyte', 'testing services', 'young adult']",NIMH,"NEWORMICS, LLC",R44,2021,749956
"Deep learning for population genetics Project Summary The revolution in genome sequencing technologies over the past 15 years has created an explosion of population genomic data but has left in its wake a gap in our ability to make sense of data at this scale. In particular, whereas population genetics as a field has been traditionally data-limited, the massive volume of current sequencing means that previously unanswerable questions may now be within reach. To capitalize on this flood of information we need new methods and modes of analysis.  In the past 5 years the world of machine learning has been revolutionized by the rise of deep neural networks. These so-called deep learning methods offer incredible flexibility as well as astounding improvements in performance for a wide array of machine learning tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. This proposal aims to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference.  In recent years our group has made great strides in using supervised machine learning for population genomic analysis (reviewed in Schrider and Kern 2018). However, this work has focused primarily on using more traditional machine learning methods such as random forests. As we argue in this proposal, DNA sequence data are particularly well suited for modern deep learning techniques, and we demonstrate that the application of these methods can rapidly lead to state-of-the-art performance in very difficult population genetic tasks such as estimating rates of recombination. The power of these methods for handling genetic data stems in part from their ability to automatically learn to extract as much useful information as possible from an alignment of DNA sequences in order to solve the task at hand, rather than relying on one or more predefined summary statistics which are generally problem-specific and may omit information present in the raw data.  In this proposal we lay out a systematic approach for both empowering the field with these tools and understanding their shortcomings. In particular, we propose to design deep neural networks for solving population genetic problems, and incorporate successful networks into user-friendly software tools that will be shared with the community. We will also investigate a variety of methods for estimating the uncertainty of predictions produced by deep learning methods; this area is understudied in machine learning but of great importance to biological researchers who require an accurate measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding an estimate. Finally, we will explore the impact of training data misspecification—wherein the data used to train a machine learning method differ systematically from the data to which it will be applied in practice. We will devise techniques to mitigate the impact of such misspecification in order to ensure that our tools will be robust to the complications inherent in analyzing real genomic data sets. Together, these advances have the potential to transform the methodological landscape of population genetic inference. Project Narrative Deep learning has revolutionized such disparate fields as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In this proposal we aim to harness the great potential of deep learning for population genetic inference. We will design, implement, and apply novel deep learning methods and provide open source software for others to both use and build upon, thereby producing valuable tools for the genetics researchers at large.",Deep learning for population genetics,10147906,R01HG010774,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Floods', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Explosions', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Software Tools', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'empowered', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'network architecture', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'stem', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'tool development', 'user friendly software']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,417279
"Integrative Predictors of Temporomandibular Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This application proposes the development of efficient web-based data management, mining, and analytics, to integrate and analyze clinical, biological, and high dimensional imaging data from TMJ OA patients. Based on our published results, we hypothesize that patterns of condylar bone structure, clinical symptoms, and biological mediators are unrecognized indicators of the severity of progression of TMJ OA. Efficiently capturing, curating, managing, integrating and analyzing this data in a manner that maximizes its value and accessibility is critical for the scientific advances and benefits that such comprehensive TMJ OA patient information may enable. High dimensional databases are increasingly difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional processing applications, creating a continuing demand for innovative approaches. Toward this end, the DCBIA at the Univ. of Michigan has partnered with the University of North Carolina, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Kitware Inc. Through high-dimensional quantitative characterization of individuals with TMJ OA, at molecular, clinical and imaging levels, we will identify phenotypes at risk for more severe prognosis, as well as targets for future therapies. The proposed web-based system, the Data Storage for Computation and Integration (DSCI), will remotely compute machine learning, image analysis, and advanced statistics from prospectively collected longitudinal data on patients with TMJ OA. Due to its ubiquitous design in the web, DSCI software installation will no longer be required. Our long-term goal is to create software and data repository for Osteoarthritis of the TMJ. Such repository requires maintaining the data in a distributed computational environment to allow contributions to the database from multi-clinical centers and to share trained models for TMJ classification. In years 4 and 5 of the proposed work, the dissemination and training of clinicians at the Schools of Dentistry at the University of North Carol, Univ. of Minnesota and Oregon Health Sciences will allow expansion of the proposed studies. In Aim 1, we will test state-of-the-art neural network structures to develop a combined software module that will include the most efficient and accurate neural network architecture and advanced statistics to mine imaging, clinical and biological TMJ OA markers identified at baseline. In Aim 2, we propose to develop novel data analytics tools, evaluating the performance of various machine learning and statistical predictive models, including customized- Gaussian Process Regression, extreme boosted trees, Multivariate Varying Coefficient Model, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic net, Random Forest, pdfCluster, decision tree, and support vector machine. Such automated solutions will leverage emerging computing technologies to determine risk indicators for OA progression in longitudinal cohorts of TMJ health and disease.

"OpenMM: Scalable biomolecular modeling, simulation, and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT OpenMM [http://openmm.org] is the most widely-used open source GPU-accelerated framework for biomolecular modeling and simulation (>1300 citations, >270,000 downloads, >1M deployed instances). Its Python API makes it widely popular as both an application (for modelers) and a library (for developers), while its C/C++/Fortran bindings enable major legacy simulation packages to use OpenMM to provide high performance on modern hardware. OpenMM has been used for probing biological questions that leverage the $14B global investment in structural data from the PDB at multiple scales, from detailed studies of single disease proteins to superfamily-wide modeling studies and large-scale drug development efforts in industry and academia. Originally developed with NIH funding by the Pande lab at Stanford, we aim to fully transition toward a community governance and sustainable development model and extend its capabilities to ensure OpenMM can power the next decade of biomolecular research. To fully exploit the revolution in QM-level accuracy with machine-learning (ML) potentials, we will add plug-in support for ML models augmented by GPU-accelerated kernels, enabling transformative science with QM-level accuracy. To enable high-productivity development of new ML models with training dataset sizes approaching 100 million molecules, we will develop a Python framework to enable OpenMM to be easily used within modern ML frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Together with continued optimizations to exploit inexpensive GPUs, these advances will power a transformation within biomolecular modeling and simulation, much as deep learning has transformed computer vision. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomolecular modeling and simulation is a key technology for leveraging the $14B global investment in biomolec- ular structure data in the protein databank to understand the basic molecular mechanisms underlying biology and disease and the development of new therapies. In this proposal, we aim to expand the development of OpenMM, a free and open source biomolecular modeling and simulation package that can exploit a wide range of consumer-grade and high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) to enable researchers and applications built on OpenMM to achieve high performance with extreme ﬂexibility. A key aspect of this proposal is to accelerate research in the emerging ﬁeld of biomolecular machine learning by tightly integrating OpenMM with modern ma- chine learning frameworks, enabling researchers to build, use, and deploy machine learning potentials, collective variables, and integrators to advance the state of biomolecular modeling.","OpenMM: Scalable biomolecular modeling, simulation, and machine learning",10100573,R01GM140090,"['Academia', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Performance', 'Plug-in', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Work', 'cluster computing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drug development', 'enzyme mechanism', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'molecular mechanics', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'operation', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'protein data bank', 'quantum', 'repository', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'software infrastructure', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,426294
"Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Interpretable Deep Learning Algorithms for Pathology Image Analysis Abstract The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research and for the understanding of biological processes of disease which leads to improved diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction. Ranging from cancer diagnosis to heart rejection and forensics the subjective interpretation of histopathology sections forms the basis of clinical decision making and research outcomes. However, it has been shown that such subjective interpretation of pathology slides suffers from large interobserver and intraobserver variability. Recent advances in computer vision and deep learning has enabled the objective and automated analysis of images. These methods have been applied with success to histology images which have demonstrated potential for development of objective image interpretation paradigms. However, significant algorithmic challenges remain to be addressed before such objective analysis of histology images can be used by clinicians and researchers. Leveraging extensive experience in developing and decimating research software based on deep learning the PI will pioneer novel algorithmic approaches to address these challenges including but not limited to: (1) training data-efficient and interpretable deep learning models with gigapixel size microscopy images for classification and segmentation using weakly supervised labels (2) fundamental redesign of data fusion paradigms for integrating information from microscopy images and molecular profiles (from multi-omics data) for improved diagnostic and prognostic determinations (3) developing visualization and interpretation software for researchers and clinical workflows to improve clinical and research validation and reproducability. The system will be designed in a modular, user-friendly manner and will be open-source, available through GitHub as universal plug-and-play modules ready to be adapted to various clinical and research applications. We will also develop a web resource with pretrained models for various organs, disease states and subtypes these will be accompanied with detailed manuals so researchers can apply deep learning to their specific research problems. Overall, the laboratory’s research will yield high impact discoveries from pathology image analysis, and its software will enable many other NIH funded laboratories to do the same, across various biomedical disciplines. Project Narrative The microscopic examination of stained tissue is a fundamental component of biomedical research, disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response prediction.

"Enhancing Assisted Reproductive Technologies with Deep Learning and Data Visualization PROJECT SUMMARY Assisted Reproduction Technology (ART) is a clinical treatment for infertile couples who want to achieve a pregnancy. In ART, embryologists fertilize eggs retrieved from the patient or a donor, culture the resulting embryos in vitro, and then transfer the selected embryo(s) to the mother's uterus. While ART is responsible for 1.9% of babies born in the United States as of 2018, selecting which embryo to transfer is a signiﬁcant challenge. The difﬁculty comes from the complexity of confounding factors and the lack of understanding of human pre-implantation embryo development. Because of this difﬁculty, multiple embryos are often transferred to increases the potential of success, resulting in multiple pregnancy rates of nearly 20%, which can lead to signiﬁcant morbidity and medical expenses to patients. The ideal is to transfer only a single embryo, but this necessitates the ability to select the best embryo from a cohort. Here, we propose to create a clinical decision support system to improve embryo selection in ART. To this end, we will develop novel deep learning models for robust embryo feature extraction and interactive data visualization methods for human-in-the-loop analysis. We will ﬁrst extract and analyze visual features from routinely collected images of embryos. We will then combine these visual features with patients' electronic health record (EHR) data to develop interpretable computation models that score embryos on their viability. We plan to integrate our machine learning solutions into an easily accessible cloud service platform that will be adaptable across clinics to improve ART embryo selection and clinical data analysis. Our research goals will be achieved by novel machine learning-based models for morphological feature extrac- tion and importance estimation of each confounding factor and a clinical decision support system for ART. For morphological feature extraction, we plan to conduct semi-supervised learning of convolutional neural networks to minimize manual labeling that requires extensive human effort. Our feature extraction model will be the ﬁrst comprehensive classiﬁcation and segmentation method for ART. To aid in embryo selection, we will develop novel deep learning-based models to predict probabilities of achieving pregnancy by accepting visual features and EHR data as the input. We will also develop visual analytic tools that allow analysts to better understand and steer these deep learning models. We will estimate the importance of each input interpretable factor in embryo selection to explain the prediction to embryologists. Finally, we will develop EmbryoProﬁler, a clinical decision support system for ART, that combines our machine learning-based models with a user-facing suite of visual analytic tools to support user guidance and clinical decision making. EmbryoProﬁler will help facilitate daily operation in clinics, foster human-guided decision making, enrich data-driven embryo analysis, and enhance the ability to select the developmentally most competent embryo for transfer to improve ART success rates. Our project will create state-of-the-art analysis approaches for ART clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is a widespread treatment for infertility, over 300,000 treatment cycles were performed in the US in 2018, but success rates remain low. In this project, we will develop novel machine learning algorithms and a clinical decision support system to assist embryologists in embryo selection. Our tools will also enable embryologists and biologists to obtain new information on the earliest stages of human embryo development, which will advance the fundamental science of human biology and lead to further improvements in ART practice.",Enhancing Assisted Reproductive Technologies with Deep Learning and Data Visualization,10185936,R01HD104969,"['Adopted', 'Age', 'Assisted Reproductive Technology', 'Back', 'Cell Lineage', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cloud Service', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'E-learning', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embryo', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Embryonic Development', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'In Vitro', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Mothers', 'Multiple Pregnancy', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pre-implantation Embryo Development', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Privacy', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Text', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States', 'Ursidae Family', 'Uterus', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blastocyst', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data cleaning', 'data curation', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'embryo cell', 'embryo monitoring', 'feature extraction', 'human-in-the-loop', 'implantation', 'improved', 'infertility treatment', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'model design', 'multi-task learning', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'operation', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'zygote']",NICHD,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,730410
"Deep learning to quantify glaucomatous damage on fundus photographs for teleophthalmology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Atalie Carina Thompson, MD, MPH is a current glaucoma fellow and Heed fellow with a long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist and leader in the field of glaucoma and public health. She has a long-standing interest in addressing healthcare disparities in medicine, and in improving the diagnosis of glaucoma and other ophthalmic diseases through imaging technology. While obtaining a medical degree at Stanford, she received a fellowship to complete a master’s degree in public health with additional higher-level coursework in biostatistics and epidemiology. Her immediate goal in this proposal is to refine and validate a deep learning (DL) algorithm capable of quantifying neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs and then to apply it in a pilot teleophthalmology program. With a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, she will acquire additional didactic training and mentored research experience in glaucoma imaging, machine learning, biostatistics, clinical research, and the responsible conduct of research. Environment: The mentorship and expertise of the advisory committee, the extensive resources at the Duke Eye Center and Departments of Biostatistics and Biomedical Engineering, and the significant institutional commitment will provide her with the support needed to transition successfully into an independent clinician-scientist. Research: This proposal will test the hypothesis that a DL algorithm trained with SDOCT detects glaucoma on optic disc photographs with greater accuracy than human graders. In Specific Aim 1, a DL algorithm that quantifies neuroretinal damage on optic disc photographs will be refined. The main hypothesis is that the quantitative output provided by the DL algorithm will allow accurate discrimination of eyes at different stages of the disease according to standard automated perimetry, and will generate cut-offs suitable for use in a screening setting. In Specific Aim 2, the short-term repeatability and reproducibility of the DL algorithm in optic disc photographs acquired over a time period of several weeks will be determined. The hypothesis is that the test-retest variability of the predictions from the DL algorithm will be similar to the original measurements acquired by SDOCT. In Specific Aim 3, the DL algorithm will be applied to optic disc photographs obtained during a pilot screening teleophthalmology program in primary care clinics and assisted living facilities. The hypothesis is that the DL algorithm will be more accurate than human graders when a full ophthalmic examination is used as the gold standard. This work will constitute the basis of an R01 grant and will advance our understanding of the application of deep learning algorithms in glaucoma and teleophthalmology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the world. However, since the disease can be asymptomatic until later stages, many patients with glaucoma will not know they have glaucoma until they suffer substantial and irreversible visual field loss.

"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan.

"Machine learning algorithms to analyze large medical image datasets Machine learning (ML) is poised to enable faster and more accurate interpretation of medical images by augmenting the capabilities of experts. The cost and difficulty of generating expert quality labelled image data is the primary limitation preventing faster progress and deployment in more domains. Success of ML techniques for medical image interpretation may reduce the burden on radiologists, reducing errors arising from fatigue or interruption, while simultaneously reducing costs and increasing speed and accuracy for patients. Our overall objective for this research is to dramatically reduce the burden of creating high quality reference labels by requiring only a small set of such labels from experts. We propose to address this problem by creating innovative algorithms that will construct reference quality labelled data with little input from domain experts, thus dramatically reducing the cost of labelling. This will enable us to apply ML techniques to generate high quality labels of the large amounts of unlabeled data that are already available, which in turn will facilitate the assessment of potential quantitative imaging biomarkers. We will develop, extend and evaluate novel algorithms that represent three distinct strategies for reducing labelling cost. These three strategies are learning from unlabelled data incorporating a novel strategy for characterizing uncertainty, optimizing sample selection for expert quality labelling with a novel form of Active Learning especially suited for deep learning, and reducing the cost of achieving quality labeling by replacing or augmenting an expert with a crowd of inexperts. We will then implement and distribute these novel algorithms, facilitating the replication of our experiments. Finally, we will demonstrate the practical efficacy of these three strategies by applying them to the important challenge of identifying quantitative imaging biomarkers that best capture alterations in brain structure that are associated with characteristics of ASD. These fundamental advances in informatics algorithms will reduce the cost and increase the rate of obtaining quality labels, which will in turn facilitate the widespread adoption and deployment of machine learning algorithms for image interpretation. Ultimately, this will stimulate the development of new imaging biomarkers that hold the potential to dramatically improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

"Continuing Tool Development for Longitudinal Network Analysis: Enriching the Diagnostic Power of Disease-Specific Connectomic Biomarkers by Deep Graph Learning Project Summary/Abstract A plethora of neuroscience studies shows mounting evidence that neurodegenerative diseases manifest distinct network dysfunction patterns much earlier prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Since the subject-specific longitudinal network changes are more relevant to the neuropathological process than topological patterns derived from cross-sectional data, recognizing the subtle and dynamic longitudinal network biomarkers from noisy network data is of great demand to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of computer-assisted diagnosis in neurodegenerative diseases. However, current popular statistical inference or machine learning approaches used for neuroimages (in a regular data structure such as grid and lattice) are not fully optimized for the learning task on brain network data which is often encoded in a high dimensional graph (an irregular and non-linear data structure). Such gross adaption is partially responsible for the lack of reliable biomarkers that can be used to predict cognitive decline in routine clinical practice. To address this challenge, we aim to (1) develop a novel GNN (graph neural network) based learning framework to hierarchically discover the multi-scale network biomarkers that can recognize the disease-relevant network alterations over time, and (2) examine the diagnostic power of the new network biomarkers derived from our GNN-based machine learning engine across neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia. The success of this project will allow us to integrate the novel GNN-based learning component into our current longitudinal network analysis toolbox and release the AI (artificial intelligence) based network analysis software to the neuroscience and neuroimaging community. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to continue the tool development of longitudinal network analysis for neurodegenerative diseases with the focus on the machine learning component. To do so, we will first develop the GNN (graph neural network) based learning framework to discover the multi-scale network biomarkers from the population of brain network data. After examining the diagnostic value of the network biomarkers discovered by our learning- based method across neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and frontotemporal dementia, we will integrate the machine learning component into our current longitudinal network analysis software and release to the neuroscience and neuroimaging community.",Continuing Tool Development for Longitudinal Network Analysis: Enriching the Diagnostic Power of Disease-Specific Connectomic Biomarkers by Deep Graph Learning,10109509,R03AG070701,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Senile Plaques', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'collaboratory', 'comparison group', 'computerized tools', 'data mining', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'high dimensionality', 'machine learning method', 'method development', 'network dysfunction', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R03,2021,158733
"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,10224845,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2021,388750
"TRACHOMA SURVEILLANCE AT SCALE: AUTOMATIC DISEASE GRADING OF EYELID PHOTOS PROJECT SUMMARY Trachoma is the leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide. The WHO has set a goal of controlling trachoma to a low enough level that blindness from the disease is no longer a public health concern. Control is defined as a district-level prevalence of follicular trachomatous inflammation (TF) in the upper tarsal conjunctiva of less than 5% in children, currently determined by clinical examination. While not required for the current definition, intense trachomatous inflammation (TI) correlates better with presence of the causative agent, Chlamydia trachomatis. Grading of both TF and TI vary widely between individuals, and even in the same individual over time. As cases become rarer, training new graders becomes more difficult. As areas become controlled, trachoma budgets are being cut, and the institutional knowledge of grading lost, making detection of remaining cases and potential resurgence difficult. One of the greatest obstacles to reaching our trachoma goals is an inadequate diagnostic test. The WHO relies on field grading of TF; human inconsistency, grader bias, and training costs are becoming major obstacles, but they do not need to be. We propose to test the central hypothesis that a fully automatic, deep learning grader can perform as well as trained physicians in detecting and grading trachoma. The hypothesis will be tested in the following Specific aims: 1) Automatic identification of follicles and grading of TF and 2) Automatic tarsal blood vessels detection and grading of TI. Our approach includes the development, training and testing of novel image processing pipelines based on semantic segmentation and disease classification using deep learning neural networks and state-of-the-art object detection. All of the data to be used in this study is secondary data from NEI-funded and other trachoma clinical trials conducted by our study team. We aim to facilitate widespread adoption of these novel tools across the trachoma research and grading community, by open source availability of generated code and interoperability of generated machine learning models across programming languages through use of the open neural networks exchange format. Our proposed research addresses the problem of subjectivity, cost and reliability of human trachoma grading. Successful completion of the proposed specific aims will also be a key step forward towards future study and development of providing health organizations and research teams with a novel, efficient and extensible tool to ensure objective, automated, scalable trachoma grading in the field to enhance, or in some cases replace, traditional field grading during the critical endgame of trachoma control, as well surveillance for potential resurgence. PROJECT NARRATIVE Trachoma elimination and control are major WHO goals, but success is limited by the ability to accurately identify and grade trachoma cases in the field manually by human graders, a process expensive, subjective and slow to scale up. This project seeks to perform secondary analysis by leveraging existing trachoma photograph datasets from numerous NEI-funded and other-sponsored prior randomized controlled trachoma studies in order to further develop a novel deep learning computational tool able to automatically detect and grade the active forms of trachoma in digital photographs. By employing deep learning neural networks and advanced image analysis, we propose to create a computer program with the ability to classify and grade trachoma in a way that is automatic, objective, scalable and with subsequent potential for remote grading which is auditable by regulatory agencies.",TRACHOMA SURVEILLANCE AT SCALE: AUTOMATIC DISEASE GRADING OF EYELID PHOTOS,10196816,R21EY032567,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Budgets', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethiopia', 'Eye diseases', 'Eyelid structure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Photography', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'Training', 'Universities', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical examination', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'conjunctiva', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'health organization', 'image processing', 'interoperability', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'programs', 'scale up', 'secondary analysis', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,242250
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10093160,R01NS111744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Limbic System', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'data acquisition', 'data fusion', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'post-trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'support vector machine', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,243545
"Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis Project Abstract (30 lines of text)  1 Systematic review and evidence mapping, both forms of research synthesis, are formal, sequential processes  2 for identifying, assessing, and integrating the primary scientific literature. These approaches, already  3 cornerstones of evidence-based medicine, have recently gained significant popularity in several other  4 disciplines including environmental, agricultural, and public health research and are increasingly utilized for  5 informed decision making by governmental organizations. It has been estimated that more than 25,000  6 systematic reviews are conducted and published annually and selecting studies for inclusion is one of the most  7 resource intensive steps for any systematic review or evidence map. In Phase I of our research plan, we have  8 developed a web-based, collaborative systematic review web application called SWIFT-Active Screener, an  9 innovative document screening tool that allows users to identify the majority of relevant articles after screening 10 only a fraction of the total number of abstracts. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional 11 research and development required to make SWIFT-Active Screener a commercial success, while also 12 building on and leveraging methods and software we have previously built to address other stages in the 13 systematic review pipeline. Therefore, one of the primary aims of our ongoing research and development is to 14 address this need by expanding the Active Screener application into an integrated platform for research 15 synthesis by uniting it with several of our other related software products. The resulting platform, which we call 16 “swift.ai,” is described in detail in “Aim 1 – Software engineering to create a unified platform for research 17 synthesis.” In “Aim 2 – Improved statistical methods for Active Screener 2.0”, we expand on the methodological 18 research completed during Phase I of this SBIR, to further develop and refine our methods. Specifically, we 19 investigate new ways to integrate state-of-the art methods in deep learning and new ways to better utilize the 20 large amounts of screening data collected from our users in order to improve our models. Finally, in “Aim 3 – 21 Living evidence maps powered by Active Screener 2.0,” we explore new approaches for using machine 22 learning to facilitate evidence mapping. Project narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a unified, web-based, collaborative, systematic review software application that integrates the latest developments in deep-learning, machine learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis,10259172,R44ES029001,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Agriculture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Elements', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Influentials', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Formulations', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'active method', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'public health research', 'research and development', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'systematic review', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R44,2021,820314
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,10116306,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'antibody test', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,591130
"A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a massive amount of clinical three-dimensional (3D) cardiac image data available today in numerous hospitals, but such data has been considerably underutilized in both clinical and engineering analyses of cardiac function. These 3D data offers unique and valuable information, allowing researchers to develop innovative, personalized approaches to treat diseases. Furthermore, using these 3D datasets as input to computational models can facilitate a population-based analysis that can be used to quantify uncertainty in treatment procedures, and can be utilized for virtual clinical trials for innovative device development. However, there are several critical technical bottlenecks preventing simulation-based clinical evaluation a reality: 1) difficulty in automatic 3D reconstruction of thin complex structures such as heart valve leaflets from clinical images, 2) computational models are constructed without mesh correspondence, which makes it challenging to run batch simulations and conduct large patient population data analyses due to inconsistencies in model setups, and 3) computing time is long, which inhibits prompt feedback for clinical use.  A potential paradigm-changing solution to the challenges is to incorporate machine learning algorithms to expedite the geometry reconstruction and computational analysis procedures. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to develop a novel computing framework, using advanced tissue modeling and machine learning techniques, to automatically process pre-operative clinical image data and predict post-operative clinical outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) intervention will serve as a testbed for the modeling methods. In Aim 1, we will develop novel shape dictionary learning (SDL) based methods for automatic reconstruction of TAVR patient aortic valves. Through the modeling process, mesh correspondence will be established across the patient geometric models. The distribution and variation of TAVR patient geometries will be described by statistical shape models (SSMs). In Aim 2, population-based FE analysis of the TAVR procedure will be conducted on thousands of virtual patient models generated by the SSMs (Aim 1). A deep neural network (DNN) will be developed and trained to learn the relationship between the TAVR FE inputs and outputs. Successful completion of this study will result in a ML-FE surrogate for TAVR analysis, combining the automated TAVR patient geometry reconstruction algorithms and the trained DNN, to provide fast TAVR biomechanics analysis without extensive re-computing of the model. Furthermore, the algorithms developed in this study can be generalized for other applications and devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current clinical image modalities can be utilized to develop patient-specific computational models to pre-operatively plan transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures. However, the computational modeling and simulation processes are time-consuming, which limits clinical translatability. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop algorithms using machine learning techniques to rapidly process and predict TAVR computational simulation outcomes directly from clinical image data.",A novel computing framework to automatically process cardiac valve image data and predict treatment outcomes,10162650,R01HL142036,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dictionary', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Extravasation', 'Feedback', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Valves', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Postoperative Period', 'Problem Sets', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Response Elements', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stents', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm training', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve replacement', 'ascending aorta', 'base', 'calcification', 'clinical application', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'population based', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'simulation', 'speech recognition', 'time resolved data', 'two-dimensional', 'virtual clinical trial', 'virtual patient']",NHLBI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,384396
"Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer Abstract FreeSurfer is a tool for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that has proven to be a flexible and powerful technology for quantifying the effects of many conditions, including numerous neurological disorders, on human brain anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, chemical composition, physiology and function. In the past 20 years, these open source tools have been developed to accurately and automatically segment an array of brain structures and have become the core analysis infrastructure for the Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI). In this project, we seek the resources to radically increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of these tools, taking advantage of exciting new results in Deep Learning. This will enable us to more accurately quantify neuroanatomical changes that are critical to diagnosing, staging and assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in diseases such as Alzheimer’s. This includes the generation of documentation, tutorials, unit tests, regression tests and system tests to harden the tools and make them usable by clinicians and neuroscientists, and finally the distribution and support of the data, manual labelings and tools to the more than 40,000 researchers that use FreeSurfer through our existing open source mechanism. In addition, we will analyze the entire Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset and return it for public release, including a set of manually labeled data that can be used to optimize Deep Learning tools for Alzheimer’s Disease over the next decade. Relevance Successful completion of the proposed project will increase the usability and accuracy of our publicly available segmentation tools, and open up new possibilities, such as integrating them into the MRI scanner and rapidly detecting Alzheimer’s-related changes. These new capabilities well enable other studies to significantly increase their ability to detect AD and other disease effects in research settings as well as phase II and phase III clinical trials due to the radical increase in speed of the new tools, enabling them to be applied to a diverse set of MRI contrasts and much larger datasets, rapidly and accurately. Further, they will allow rapid application of cutting-edge analyses to the ongoing Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset, improving the ability to extract early biomarkers of this devastating disease.",Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer,10143171,R01AG064027,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'early detection biomarkers', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'skills', 'spatial relationship', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site', 'wiki']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,655746
"Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia ABSTRACT The “preclinical” phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal levels of brain amyloid accumulation in the absence of major symptoms, can last decades, and potentially holds the key to successful therapeutic strategies. Today there is an urgent need for quantitative biomarkers and genetic tests that can predict clinical progression at the individual level. This project will develop cutting edge machine learning algorithms that will mine high dimensional, multi-modal, and longitudinal data to derive models that yield individual-level clinical predictions in the context of dementia. The developed prognostic models will specifically utilize ubiquitous and affordable data types: structural brain MRI scans, saliva or blood-derived genome-wide sequence data, and demographic variables (age, education, and sex). Prior research has demonstrated that all these variables are strongly associated with clinical decline to dementia, however to date we have no model that can harvest all the predictive information embedded in these high dimensional data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to compute clinical predictions from high- dimensional biomedical data such as clinical scans. Yet, most prior ML methods were developed for applications where the ``prediction’’ task was about concurrent condition (e.g., discriminate cases and controls); and established risk factors (e.g., age), multiple modalities (e.g., genotype and images) and longitudinal data were not fully exploited. This application’s core innovation will be to develop rigorous, flexible, and practical ML methods that can fully exploit multi-modal, longitudinal, and high- dimensional biomedical data to compute prognostic clinical predictions. The proposed project will build on the PI’s strong background in computational modeling and analysis of large-scale biomedical data. We will employ an innovative Bayesian ML framework that offers the flexibility to handle and exploit real-life longitudinal and multi-modal data. We hypothesize that the developed models will be more useful than alternative benchmarks for identifying preclinical individuals who are at heightened risk of imminent clinical decline. We will use a statistically rigorous approach for discovery, cross-validation, and benchmarking the developed tools. This project will yield freely distributed, documented, and validated software and models for predicting future clinical progression based on whole-genome, longitudinal structural MRI and demographic data. We believe the algorithms and software we develop will yield invaluable tools for stratifying preclinical AD subjects in drug trials, optimizing future therapies, and minimizing the risk of adverse effects. NARRATIVE Emerging technologies allow us to identify clinically healthy subjects harboring Alzheimer’s pathology. While many of these preclinical individuals progress to dementia, sometimes quite quickly, others remain asymptomatic for decades. The proposed project will develop sophisticated data mining algorithms to derive models that can predict future clinical decline based on ubiquitous, easy- to-collect, and affordable data modalities: brain MRI scans, saliva or blood- derived whole-genome sequences, and clinical and demographic variables.","Advanced machine learning algorithms that integrate genomewide, longitudinal MRI and demographic data to predict future cognitive decline toward dementia",10188360,R01AG053949,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Bayesian learning', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Harvest', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Prevention approach', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Saliva', 'Scanning', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'aging brain', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'case control', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'data mining', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'genetic testing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk minimization', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'software development', 'sound', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NIA,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,410000

"Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals PROJECT SUMMARY The transmission or ‘spillover’ of wildlife viruses to humans is a critical threat to global health, with outbreaks of viral pathogens like filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses all originating in wild mammals. A key outstanding question is whether specific taxonomic groups, such as bats, warrant extra surveillance as ‘special reservoirs’ of viruses that are potentially pathogenic to humans. However, existing host-virus datasets are not sufficiently resolved to predict fine-grain risk for species or genera. An effective response must therefore address two core aims: (i) synthesizing knowledge regarding virus-to-mammal interactions; and (ii) using that knowledgebase to robustly predict future spillover events (i.e., zoonotic risk). To enable robust analysis and reusability of public datasets of NIAID’s Bioinformatics Resource Center (BRC; especially NCBI Virus and Virus Pathogen Resources, ViPR), the project will develop Host-Virus Data Intelligence to address three main problems for data reuse: confidence of the taxonomic assignments of mammals and viruses in observations; confidence in the evidence for proposed mammal-virus interactions; and connecting all the relevant data in published texts that are hidden from existing databases. The project team will construct a novel bioinformatic pipeline that will digitally connect taxonomic knowledge, use it to search dark data to find evidence of potential host-virus interactions, and then link it together using metadata layers (‘data about the data’) to form a more expansive host-virus knowledge graph than previously feasible. The project’s computational approach leverages information extraction methods in natural language processing as well as novel applications of artificial intelligence methods such as probabilistic inductive logic programming. A key anticipated outcome is to expand the dataset of host-virus interactions by 3-fold compared to comprehensive existing datasets. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a new generation of work reusing host-virus interaction data to test previously inaccessible hypotheses about how species’ traits impact viral spillover to humans. Shifting the paradigm to graph-based analyses, compared to purely taxonomic representations of host-virus interactions, will allow researchers to directly investigate the impact of ecosystem structure and human encroachment upon viral loads. Determining whether all mammals have equal risk of viral spillover, or whether some groups have higher taxon-specific zoonotic risk (e.g., horseshoe bats, murid rodents), is critical information for public health workers and epidemiologists. More definitive risk quantification will also help researchers identify which ecophysiological adaptations predispose certain groups to tolerating more viruses, which may in turn lead to clinical treatments by modeling the immune responses of wild mammals. Filling the identified gaps in host-virus knowledge is therefore essential to aid the progress of zoonotic disease research in the wake of COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE Synthesizing scientific data about mammal-to-virus interactions is essential to predicting the risk of future events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The project overcomes major obstacles to full and accurate reuse of existing mammal-virus data by applying computational methods for unifying relevant but disconnected data from published sources. Anticipated results will triple available knowledge, opening the door for asking whether some mammals carry more viruses than others and why with unprecedented levels of precision.",Intelligently predicting viral spillover risks from bats and other wild mammals,10289637,R21AI164268,"['Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Base Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Epidemiologist', 'Event', 'FAIR principles', 'Feces', 'Filovirus', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immune response', 'Immunological Models', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Mammals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Muridae', 'Names', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Paramyxovirus', 'Pathogenicity', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Services', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Taxon', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral reservoir', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'bioinformatics resource', 'data reuse', 'digital', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'knowledge graph', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic virus', 'prevent', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'surveillance study', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'virus host interaction']",NIAID,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2021,244519
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,10131881,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2021,459231
"COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data Project Summary/Abstract  The brain imaging community is greatly benefiting from extensive data sharing efforts currently underway. However, there is still a major gap in that much data is still not openly shareable, which we propose to address. In addition, current approaches to data sharing often include significant logistical hurdles both for the investigator sharing the data (e.g. often times multiple data sharing agreements and approvals are required from US and international institutions) as well as for the individual requesting the data (e.g. substantial computational re- sources and time is needed to pool data from large studies with local study data). This needs to change, so that the scientific community can create a venue where data can be collected, managed, widely shared and analyzed while also opening up access to the (many) data sets which are not currently available (see overview on this from our group7). The large amount of existing data requires an approach that can analyze data in a distributed way while (if required) leaving control of the source data with the individual investigator or the data host; this motivates a dynamic, decentralized way of approaching large scale analyses. During the previous funding period, we developed a peer-to-peer system called the Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation (COINSTAC). Our system provides an independent, open, no-strings-attached tool that performs analysis on datasets distributed across different locations. Thus, the step of actually aggregating data is avoided, while the strength of large-scale analyses can be retained. During this new phase we respond to the need for advanced algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, by proposing to develop decentralized models for these approaches and also implement a fully scalable cloud-based framework with enhanced security features. To achieve this, in Aim 1, we will incorporate the necessary functionality to scale up analyses via the ability to work with either local or commercial private cloud environments, together with advanced visualization, quality control, and privacy and security features. This suite of new functions will open the floodgates for the use of COINSTAC by the larger neuroscience community to enable new discovery and analysis of unprecedented amounts of brain imaging data located throughout the world. We will also improve usability, training materials, engage the community in contributing to the open source code base, and ultimately facilitate the use of COINSTAC's tools for additional science and discovery in a broad range of applications. In Aim 2 we will extend the framework to handle powerful algorithms such as linear mixed effects models and deep learning, and to perform meta-learning for leveraging and updating fit models. And finally, in Aim 3, we will test this new functionality through a partnership with the worldwide ENIGMA addiction group, which is currently not able to perform advanced machine learning analyses on data that cannot be centrally located. We will evaluate the impact of 6 main classes of substances of abuse (e.g. methamphetamines, cocaine, cannabis, nicotine, opiates, alcohol and their combinations) using the new developed functionality. 3 Project Narrative  Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on collecting human neuroimaging data for clinical and re- search studies, many of which do not come with subject consent for sharing or contain sensitive data which are not easily shared, such as genetics. Open sharing of raw data, though desirable from the research perspective, and growing rapidly, is not a viable solution for a large number of datasets which have additional privacy risks or IRB concerns. The COINSTAC solution we propose enables us to capture this `missing data' and achieve the same performance as pooling of both open and `closed' repositories by developing privacy preserving versions of advanced and cutting edge algorithms (including linear mixed effects models and deep learning) and incorpo- rating within an easy-to-use and scalable platform which enables distributed computation. 2","COINSTAC 2.0: decentralized, scalable analysis of loosely coupled data",10269008,R01DA040487,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical Data', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Consent', 'Consent Forms', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methamphetamine', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Science', 'Security', 'Series', 'Site', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Substance of Abuse', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data harmonization', 'data repository', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data visualization', 'deep learning', 'distributed data', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'life-long learning', 'negative affect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open data', 'open source', 'peer', 'privacy preservation', 'repository', 'scale up', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'usability', 'virtual']",NIDA,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,617911
"Adaptive evolutionary inference frameworks for understudied populations using generative neural networks PROJECT SUMMARY In the field of population genetics, machine learning methods are emerging as promising frameworks for understanding evolution. However, these algorithms rely heavily on simulated datasets, which currently fail to recapitulate the features of diverse natural genomes. Deep neural networks in particular are disconnected from evolutionary modeling, and their results are difficult to interpret in a biological context. In this project, we propose to develop simulation frameworks that automatically adapt to any population or species. The resulting customized synthetic datasets will be used to train neural networks that quantify the unique evolutionary histories of understudied human groups. By including genealogical and epigenetic information as auxiliary input, we will be able to link predictions back to genomic features. Our results will enable us to estimate the interactions between local phenomena such as natural selection, mutation patterns, and recombination hotspots. Taken together, outcomes from our work will allow us to create a detailed model evolutionary of processes, both along the genome and across human populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE In population genetics, machine learning methods are emerging as promising frameworks for understanding evolution. However, it is difficult to apply these algorithms to understudied populations, as they are reliant on custom simulations, difficult to interpret, and disconnected from evolutionary modeling.

"SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community Physics-based simulations provide a powerful framework for understanding biological form and function. They harmonize heterogeneous experimental data with real-world physical constraints, helping researchers understand biological systems as they engineer novel drugs, new diagnostics, medical devices, and surgical interventions. The rise in new sensors and simulation tools is generating an increasing amount of data, but this data is often inaccessible, preventing reuse and limiting scientific progress. In 2005, we launched SimTK, a website to develop and share biosimulation tools, models, and data, to address these issues. SimTK now supports 62,000+ researchers globally and 950+ projects. Members use it to meet their grants’ data sharing responsibilities; experiment with new ways of collaborating; and build communities around their datasets and tools. However, challenges remain: many researchers still do not share their digital assets due to the time needed to prepare, document, and maintain those assets, and since SimTK hosts a growing number of diverse digital assets, the site now also faces the challenge of making these assets discoverable and reusable. Thus, we propose a plan to extend SimTK and implement new solutions to promote scientific data sharing and reuse. First, we will maintain the reliable, user-friendly foundation upon which SimTK is built, continuing to provide the excellent support our members expect and supporting the site’s existing features for sharing and building communities. Second, we will implement methods to establish a culture of model and data sharing in the biomechanics community. We will encourage researchers to adopt new habits, making sharing part of their workflow, by enabling the software and systems they use to automatically upload models and data to SimTK via an application programming interface (API) and by recruiting leading researchers in the community to serve as beta testers and role models. Third, we will create tools to easily replicate and extend biomechanics simulations. Containers and cloud computing services allow researchers to capture and share a snapshot of their computing environment, enabling unprecedented fidelity in sharing. We will integrate these technologies into SimTK and provide custom, easy-to-use interfaces to replicate and extend simulation studies. Lastly, we will develop a metadata standard for models and data for the biomechanics community, increasing reusability and discoverability of the rich set of resources shared on SimTK. We will use the new standard on SimTK and fill in the metadata fields automatically using natural language processing and machine learning, minimizing the burden and inaccuracies of manual metadata entry. We will evaluate our success in achieving these aims by tracking the number of assets shared and the frequency they are used as a springboard to new research. These changes will accelerate biomechanics research and provide new tools to increase the reusability and impact of shared resources. By lowering barriers to data sharing in the biosimulation community, SimTK will continue to serve as a model for how to create national infrastructure for scientific subdisciplines. SimTK is a vibrant hub for the development and sharing of simulation software, data, and models of biological structures and processes. SimTK-based resources are being used to design medical devices and drugs, to generate new diagnostics, to create surgical interventions, and to provide insights into biology. The proposed enhancements to SimTK will accelerate progress in the field by lowering barriers to and standardizing data and model sharing, thus 1) increasing the quantity and also, importantly, the quality of resources that researchers share and 2) enabling others to reproduce and build on the wealth of past biomechanics research studies.",SimTK: An Ecosystem for Data and Model Sharing in the Biomechanics Community,10085652,R01GM124443,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomechanics', 'Biophysics', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Explosion', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Security', 'Services', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomechanical model', 'community building', 'complex biological systems', 'data access', 'data cleaning', 'data ecosystem', 'data reuse', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'member', 'metadata standards', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'research study', 'response', 'role model', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,489919
"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to advance the science of biological networks by creating leading-edge bioinformatic methods, software tools and infrastructure, and by engaging the scientific community in a portfolio of collaboration and training opportunities. Much of biomedical research is dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including molecular interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and drugs; cell communication systems; relationships among genotypes and biological and clinical phenotypes; and patient and social networks. NRNB-supported platforms like Cytoscape are among the most widely used software tools in biology, with tens of thousands of active users, enabling researchers to apply network concepts and data to understand biological systems and how they are reprogrammed in disease.  NRNB’s three Technology Research and Development projects introduce innovative concepts with the potential to transform network biology, transitioning it from a static to a dynamic science (TR&D 1); from flat network diagrams to multi-scale hierarchies of biological structure and function (TR&D 2); and from descriptive interaction maps to predictive and interpretable machine learning models (TR&D 3). In previous funding periods our technology projects have produced novel and highly cited approaches, including network-based biomarkers for stratification of disease, data-driven gene ontologies assembled completely from network data, and deep learning models of cell structure and function built using biological networks as a scaffold.  During the next period of support, we introduce dynamic regulatory networks formulated from single-cell transcriptomics and advanced proteomics data (TR&D 1); substantially improved methodology for the study of hierarchical structure and pleiotropy in biological networks (TR&D 2); and procedures for using networks to seed machine learning models of drug response that are both mechanistically interpretable and transferable across biomedical contexts (TR&D 3). These efforts are developed and applied in close collaboration with outside investigators from 19 Driving Biomedical Projects who specialize in experimental generation of network data, disease biology (cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes), single-cell developmental biology, and clinical trials. TR&Ds are also bolstered by 7 Technology Partnerships in which NRNB scientists coordinate technology development with leading resource-development groups in gene function prediction, mathematics and algorithm development, and biomedical databases. Beyond these driving collaborations, we continually support a broader portfolio of transient (non-driving) research collaborations; organize and lead international meetings including the popular Network Biology track of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference; and deliver a rich set of training opportunities and network analysis protocols. OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We are all familiar with some of the components of biological systems – DNA, proteins, cells, organs, individuals – but understanding biological systems involves more than just cataloging its component parts. It is critical to understand the many interactions of these parts within systems, and how these systems give rise to biological functions and responses and determine states of health and disease.

"Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning Summary Phages, which are the naturally evolved predators of bacteria, may hold the key to combating bacterial pathogens, including the looming threat of multidrug resistant bacteria. Phages are viruses which while harmless to humans and have been successfully engineered as tools to separate, concentrate, and detect their bacterial hosts. Additionally, phages have been used as therapeutic agents to treat patients infected with pathogens resistant to known antibiotics. While the potential benefits of phages are numerous, certain limitations must be addressed in order to fully employ them. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that both top-down and bottom-up approaches can be utilized to design and synthesize novel phages, through a combination of synthetic biology and machine learning. This will result in phage-based tools with increased functionality and customizable host ranges. The rationale for the proposed research is that as the threat of bacterial infections including those with multi-drug resistance continues to grow, phages, which have evolved to efficiently recognize and kill bacteria, will become indispensable tools. Therefore, the ability to rapidly design and engineer new phages for biosensing and therapeutics will be a critical advantage to human health. The proposal contains three specific aims which are supported by preliminary data and cited literature. Aim 1: Site-directed conjugation for advanced phage-based biosensors and therapeutics. Under this aim, phages will be modified with alkyne-containing unnatural amino acids allowing their direct conjugation to 1) azide decorated magnetic nanoparticles, and 2) azide terminated polyethylene glycol. The modifications will allow the development of magnetic phages for bacteria separation and detection, and phages that are more effective therapeutics due to their ability to avoid a patient’s innate immune response, respectively. Aim 2: Decoding phage biorecognition elements using machine learning. In this aim, machine learning will be used to model the binding of phages and their bacterial hosts. The model will enable the prediction of host interactions as well as allow the design and synthesis of novel phage tail fibers which can target specific bacterial isolates. Aim 3: Repurposing phage biorecognition for a broader host ranges. Under the final aim, phage-binding proteins will be replaced with those known to recognize conserved regions of the bacterial LPS, resulting in a phage with a much broader host range. This approach is innovative because it uses top-down characterizations for bottom-up design and synthesis of novel phages. Traditional phage screening methods will be replaced with the rapid synthesis of phages, which are optimized for a particular bacterial isolate. Following the successful completion of the specific aims, the expected outcome is the design and synthesis of phages that can be used to target a selected group of bacteria within Enterobacteriaceae for advanced biosensing and therapeutics. A publically available computer model will allow rapid design of custom phage biorecognition elements which can be added to functionalized phages. These technologies will allow researchers to tip the scales of the co-evolutionary arms race between phage and bacteria. Narrative The project is relevant to public health because it accelerates the development of phage-based tools for the rapid detection of bacterial pathogens in human, food, and environmental samples, and the treatment of diseases from multidrug resistant bacteria by integrating machine learning and synthetic biology. Thus, it is specifically relevant to part of NIH's mission that pertains to the diagnosis, prevention, and cure of human diseases.",Accelerating phage evolution and tools via synthetic biology and machine learning,10017215,R01EB027895,"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'Address', 'Alkynes', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Azides', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacteriophage T4', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Biosensor', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Capsid', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'DNA Restriction-Modification Enzymes', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Environment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Food', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Innate Immune Response', 'Innate Immune System', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic nanoparticles', 'Magnetism', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter', 'Multiple Bacterial Drug Resistance', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'arm', 'base', 'design', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'rapid detection', 'receptor', 'resistance mechanism', 'screening', 'synthetic biology', 'therapeutically effective', 'tool', 'unnatural amino acids']",NIBIB,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,638466
"Learning to learn in structural biology with deep neural networks Project Summary/Abstract  Deep learning is gaining traction across many elds as a powerful tool. In medicine, there have been recent successes in drug design, predicting protein structure, and in functional genomics. These successes have thus far been in areas where there are hundreds of thousands of data points and deep learning in medicine is still limited by lack of large homongeous datasets.  This proposal focuses on applying a new kind of deep learning called meta-learning that mimics the human-like ability to learn from few examples. The PI will establish a sustainable research program on meta-learning by developing benchmark problems and datasets. The PI will further explore meta-learning speci cally on peptide-protein structure and NMR spectra prediction. Due to the imperative need for interpretability when using deep learning in medicine, a strong component will be connecting biophysical modeling with the deep learning models.  The outcome of this work will be a demonstrated new approach to deep learning that can work with little data. The PI will bring these research ideas together to design peptides that can bind to intrinsically disordred proteins, a challenging but important task for curing neurodegenerative diseases. This will be accomplished through meta-learning, molecular simulation, and iterative peptide design. Project Narrative  Deep learning is a technique from arti cial intelligence that has driven many high-pro le break- throughs in recognizing objects in images, translating human languages, and playing games like Chess and Go. Its use is medicine is currently limited by deep learning's need for large amounts of data and its lack of interpretability.

"A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis. The opioid epidemic in the United States has been traced to a 1980 letter reporting in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that synthetic opioids are not addictive. A belated citation analysis led the journal to append this letter with a warning this letter has been “heavily and uncritically cited” as evidence that addiction is rare with opioid therapy.” This epidemic is but one example of how unreliable and uncritically cited scientific claims can affect public health, as studies from industry report that a substantial part of biomedical reports cannot be independently verified. Yet, there is no publicly available resource or indicator to determine how reliable a scientific claim is without becoming an expert on the subject or retaining one. The total citation count, the commonly used measure, is inherently a poor proxy for research quality because confirming and refuting citations are counted as equal, while the prestige of the journal is not a guarantee that a claim published there is true. The lack of indicators for the veracity of reported claims costs the public, businesses, and governments, billions of dollars per year. We have developed a prototype that automatically classifies statements citing a scientific claim into three classes: those that provide supporting or contradicting evidence, or merely mention the claim. This unique capability enables scite users to analyze the reliability of scientific claims at an unprecedented scale and speed, helping them to make better-informed decisions. The prototype has attracted potential customers among top biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, academia, and academic publishers. We propose to conduct research that will refine scite into an MVP by optimizing prototype efficiency and accuracy until they reach feasible milestones, and will refine the product-market fit in our beachhead market, academic publishing, whose influence on the integrity and reliability of research is difficult to overestimate. We propose to develop a platform that can be used to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims. Our deep learning model, combined with a network of experts, automatically classifies citations as supporting, contradicting, or mentioning, allowing users to easily assess the veracity of scientific articles and consequently researchers. By introducing a system that can identify how a research article has been cited, not just how many times, we can assess research better than traditional analytical approaches, thus helping to improve public health by identifying and promoting reliable research and by increasing the return on public and private investment in research.",A deep learning platform to evaluate the reliability of scientific claims by citation analysis.,10162578,R44DA050155,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biotechnology', 'Businesses', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Epidemic', 'Government', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'New England', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Program Description', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Visual system structure', 'addiction', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning classifier', 'literature citation', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid therapy', 'product development', 'programs', 'prototype', 'synthetic opioid', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIDA,"SCITE, INC.",R44,2021,753275
"Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data Project Abstract/Summary Our interdisciplinary research team will develop algorithms to accelerate the detection of respiratory virus outbreaks at an unprecedented local scale in US cities. We propose to advance outbreak detection by combining machine learning data integration methods and spatial models of disease transmission. The dynamic models that will be developed will provide mechanistic engines for distinguishing typical from atypical disease trends and the optimization methods evaluate the informativeness of data sources to achieve specified public health goals through the rapid evaluation of diverse input data sources. Working with local healthcare and public health leaders, we will translate the algorithms into user-friendly online tools to support preparedness plans and decision-making. Our proposed research is organized around three major aims. In Aim 1, we will apply machine learning and signal processing methods to build systems that track the earliest indicators of emerging outbreaks within seven US cities. We will evaluate non-clinical data reflecting early and mild symptoms as well as clinical data covering underserved communities and geographic and demographic hotspots for viral emergence. In Aim 2, we will develop sub-city scale models reflecting the syndemics of co-circulating respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) that can exacerbate viral infections. We will infer viral transmission rates and socio-environmental risk cofactors by fitting the model to respiratory disease data extracted from millions of electronic health records (EHRs) for the last nine years. We will then partner with clinical and EHR experts to translate our models into the first outbreak detection system for severe respiratory viruses that incorporates EHR data on CRDs. Using machine learning techniques, we will further integrate other surveillance, environmental, behavioral and internet predictor data sources to maximize the accuracy, sensitivity, speed and population coverage of our algorithms. In Aim 3, we will develop an open-access Python toolkit to facilitate the integration of next generation data into outbreak surveillance models. This project will produce practical early warning algorithms for detecting emerging viral threats at high spatiotemporal resolution in several US cities, elucidate socio-geographic gaps in current surveillance systems and hotspots for viral emergence, and provide a robust design framework for extrapolating these algorithms to other US cities. Project Narrative We will develop innovative algorithms for detecting emerging respiratory viruses within US cities. To do so, we will model the syndemic dynamics of respiratory viruses and chronic respiratory diseases and apply machine learning to combine geospatial data that track early indicators of emerging threats. Working with local public health and healthcare collaborators, we will translate this research into practical tools for addressing socio- geographic gaps in surveillance and accelerating the detection, prevention and mitigation of severe outbreaks.","Accelerating viral outbreak detection in US cities using mechanistic models, machine learning and diverse geospatial data",10265769,R01AI151176,"['Absenteeism', 'Address', 'African', 'Age', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Articulation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cities', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease model', 'Ebola', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Pythons', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Sentinel', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Surveillance Modeling', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'austin', 'base', 'cofactor', 'comorbidity', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'detection method', 'detection platform', 'digital', 'disease transmission', 'diverse data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiological model', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'health care availability', 'health goals', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'influenza outbreak', 'influenzavirus', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metropolitan', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pandemic disease', 'public health intervention', 'respiratory virus', 'school district', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographic group', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'underserved community', 'user-friendly', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,482268

"Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The Arkansas Research Alliance proposes to hold five annual workshops on the subject of bioinformatics. The purpose is to bring six major Arkansas institutions into closer collaboration. Those institutions are: University of Arkansas-Fayetteville; Arkansas State University; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas at Little Rock; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Center for Toxicological Research. The workshops will focus on capabilities at each of the six in sciences related to bioinformatics including artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, food and agriculture, high speed computing, and visualization capabilities. As this work progresses, educational coordination and student encouragement will be important components. Principals from all six institutions are collaborating to accomplish the workshop goals. Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,10214625,R13FD006690,[' '],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2021,3125
"Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1 PROJECT SUMMARY Previous studies showed discrepancies of health and behavior prevalence between American Indians (AI) population and other racial or ethnic groups. Most health surveys have certain limitations when studying AI population due to the small sample sizes for AI population. Data collected by AI Tribal Epidemiology Centers (TECs) provides an excellent opportunity to conduct research for AI population due to sufficient sample size and extensive information. However, most surveys conducted by TECs used non-probability sampling design (e.g. convenient sample) due to its lower cost and increased time efficiency. Non-probability sample may suffer from sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors without further proper adjustments. Such difficulties greatly hampers the analysis of AI population in health and behavior research. Our general hypothesis is that data integration by combining information from non-probability and probability samples can reduce sampling, coverage and nonresponse errors in original non-probability sample. The Goal of this project is to develop an accurate and robust data integration methodology for AI population analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research. During the past years, we have 1) studied data integration using calibration and parametric modeling approaches; 2) investigated machine learning and propensity score modeling methods in survey sampling and other fields; and 3) assembled an experienced team of multi-disciplinary team of experts. In this project, we propose to capitalize on our expertise and fulfill the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a data integration approach using machine learning and propensity score modeling We will develop machine learning and propensity score based data integration approaches to combine information from non-probability and probability samples. Compared to existing methods (i.e., Calibration, Parametric approach), our proposed approaches are more robust against the failure of underlying model assumptions. The inference is more general and multi-purpose (e.g. one can estimate most parameters such as means, totals and percentiles). Simulation studies will be performed to compare our proposed methods with other existing methods. A computing package will be built to implement the method in other settings. Aim 2. Evaluate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in AI health and behavior research We will use real data to validate the proposed methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to the various data types. The performance will also be assessed by comparing with results from existing data integration methods such as calibration and parametric modeling approaches. The planned study takes advantage of a unique data source and expands the impact of the Indian Health Service (IHS)-funded research. We expect this novel integration method will vertically advance the field by facilitating the analysis based on non-probability sample, which can provide in-depth understanding regarding the AI population health and behavior studies. Project Narrative The overall goal of this R21 project is to develop an accurate, robust and multi-purpose data integration methodology for AI population (non-probability sample) analysis specifically tailored to health and behavior research such as diabetes and smoking. The code implementing the proposed method will be released and is general enough to be applied to AI population studies of other fileds. The success of this study will vertically advance the field by facilitating the AI population analysis, which can provide a better guidance and new insights on the future precision personalized prevention and treatment of certain diseases.",Improving the representativeness of American Indian Tribal Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (TBRFSS) by machine learning and propensity score based data integration approach A1,10271402,R21MD014658,"['Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'American Indians', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System', 'Calibration', 'Censuses', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geographic state', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Fairs', 'Health Surveys', 'Health behavior', 'High Prevalence', 'Kansas', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Oklahoma', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Probability Samples', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respondent', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'United States Indian Health Service', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cigarette smoking', 'cluster computing', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data quality', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'population health', 'simulation', 'smoking prevalence', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tribal health']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA HLTH SCIENCES CTR,R21,2021,109613
"Automating mosquito microdissection for a malaria PfSPZ vaccine ABSTRACT Despite annual investments of >$3 billion for intensive control measures, in 2018, the 228 million cases of malaria were an increase of ~16 million cases over 2015, and no decrease in number of deaths. The impact of available malaria control measure has plateaued. Moreover, WHO estimates deaths from malaria could double across sub-Saharan Africa this year due to disruptions in access to control measures due to the current global COVID-19 pandemic malaria. New tools, especially a vaccine, are needed. Only broad deployment of an effective vaccine holds the promise of true elimination or eradication, especially in the face of sudden developments like COVID-19. More than 98% of all deaths from malaria are caused by Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). Thus, a vaccine against Pf malaria is the priority. Sanaria is moving in 2021 to Phase 3 clinical trials of its Pf sporozoite (SPZ), PfSPZ Vaccine, and is planning for marketing authorization (licensure) from FDA and EMA in 2022/2023. Over the next 5-10 years we aim to decrease the cost of goods (COGs) and efficiency of production of PfSPZ vaccines so they can be used most effectively and economically by individuals who suffer the most from malaria. Microdissection of mosquitoes is a crucial step in extraction of PfSPZ vaccine products, and ensures a 10,000-fold purification away from irrelevant mosquito parts as the starting material for downstream purification procedures that then achieve a final product purity of 99.9%. To-date, mosquito salivary gland PfSPZ have demonstrated in vivo infectivity/potency superior to those extracted from whole mosquitoes, or grown outside a mosquito. However, extraction of mosquito salivary glands is a rate-limiting, labor-intensive, expensive step in production of PfSPZ-based vaccines. The overarching aim of this proposal is to enable implementation of an interim semi-automated dissection device in cGMP production of PfSPZ-based vaccines against malaria, and develop an integrated dissection system incorporating multiple automation steps downstream of mosquito orientation, for commercial-scale manufacturing. The unique application of robotic technology, state-of-the art computer vision and machine learning algorithms, and software systems to production-scale processing of very small insects in cleanrooms not only advances manufacturing capabilities, but also represents a spectrum of milestone innovations in automation. Success in this project involving a highly-skilled multi-disciplinary team of investigators, manufacturing and quality experts will decidedly lead to further streamlining and process optimization during the key step of isolating mosquito salivary glands for manufacture of our highly effective PfSPZ-based vaccines. The breakthroughs that initially defined a vaccine that is far superior to competing technologies in both safety and protective efficacy, will continue, as we advance in the proposed studies to make vaccine extraction more cost-effective due to greater efficiencies, mitigation of human error and operator fatigue, reduced timeframes, greatly reduced training periods, and increased product purity, towards deployment of a highly-impactful tool in the fight against malaria. Malaria claims upwards of 600,000 human lives each year, with more than 1,000 children succumbing every day. Sanaria’s Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines against malaria have demonstrated outstanding safety and efficacy in numerous clinical trials. The manufacturing procedure for PfSPZ-based crucially involves a currently labor-intensive process of mosquito salivary gland extraction entirely by manual dissection. Our aim in this proposal is to first introduce an interim semi-automated dissection fixture for this process. In parallel efforts, incorporating automation in key steps of mosquito decapitation, and extraction of glands will lead to greater efficiencies, reduce timeframes, greatly reduce training times, mitigate human error and operator fatigue while maintaining product purity and quality that is thought to underlie an incredible safety record of Sanaria’s PfSPZ vaccines. These outcomes will accelerate Sanaria’s march to licensure and production of commercial-scale volumes required to meet demand for post-licensure distribution to populations with greatest need, world- wide.",Automating mosquito microdissection for a malaria PfSPZ vaccine,10258416,R44AI134500,"['Africa South of the Sahara', 'Authorization documentation', 'Automation', 'Body part', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comb animal structure', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Culicidae', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Decapitation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dissection', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Geometry', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Insecta', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Licensure', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microdissection', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molds', 'Needles', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Plasmodium falciparum vaccine', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Salivary Glands', 'Scheme', 'Sporozoites', 'Stainless Steel', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vaccines', 'Vision', 'base', 'cGMP production', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'experience', 'feeding', 'fight against', 'human error', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturing scale-up', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'process optimization', 'protective efficacy', 'prototype', 'robotic system', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NIAID,"SANARIA, INC.",R44,2021,1000000
"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,10063532,R01GM130825,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effectiveness testing', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,360227
"Merging machine learning and mechanistic models to improve prediction and inference in emerging epidemics PROJECT SUMMARY When an outbreak of an established or emerging infectious disease occurs we ask a standard set of questions that are critical to a lifesaving public health response: Where will future incidence occur? How many cases will there be? And where can we most effectively intervene? The proposed research is motivated by real world instances where answering these questions was critical to making practical public health decisions, and current methods came up short: from deciding if and where to build additional Ebola Treatment Units in the 2014-15 West African Ebola epidemic, to identifying priority districts where oral cholera vaccine should be used in the 2016-17 cholera outbreak in Yemen, to picking locations where sufficient cases might occur to selecting and prioritizing interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. Forecasts informing such decisions are typically generated either using an epidemic model that relies on knowledge of the disease transmission mechanism and epidemic theory or using a statistical model to project the expected number of cases based on the relationship between covariates and observed counts. However, both approaches are subject to limitations, particularly early in an epidemic when few cases are observed. This project is based on the overarching scientific premise that inferences that combine the strengths of mechanistic epidemic models and statistical covariate models will substantially outperform either approach alone in forecasting and making decisions to confront emerging infectious disease threats. Specifically, this project aims to (1) Develop a framework to forecast incidence in ongoing outbreaks that merges mechanistic and machine learning approaches; (2) Validate the framework using retrospective data and apply the framework to inform decision making in emerging epidemics; (3) Integrate this inferential forecasting framework into causal decision theory to optimize critical actions in the public health response to emerging epidemics; and (4) Develop accessible and extensible tools for forecasting and decision analysis in infectious disease epidemics. We will validate these approaches using rigorous simulation studies and by applying the proposed approaches to retrospective data from important recent epidemics (e.g., Ebola, Cholera and COVID-19, as mentioned above). We will prospectively apply our approach to inform the response to emerging disease threats that occur during the project period, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To ensure that the tools developed are useful, efficient, and user friendly, we will work with international humanitarian organizations responding to epidemics. Successful completion of these aims will provide a flexible and validated framework for forecasting and decision making during ongoing epidemics, while allowing for innovation in mechanistic and statistical approaches. In doing so it will provide tools to optimize responses and reduce morbidity and mortality during public health crises. PROJECT NARRATIVE The purpose of the proposed project is to improve inference, forecasting and decision making in response to emerging infectious diseases by developing a framework to integrate mechanistic and statistical approaches to epidemic modeling and causal inference. Approaches developed will be validated using simulations and retrospective data and applied prospectively to reduce morbidity and mortality in emerging public health crises.

"A system for long-term high-resolution 3D tracking of movement kinematics in freely behaving animals PROJECT SUMMARY The aim of this proposal is to deliver an innovative and easy-to-use experimental platform for measuring and quantifying naturalistic behaviors of mammalian animal models used for biomedical research, including rodents and monkeys, across a range of spatial and temporal scales. This will require developing a method for tracking movements freely behaving animals with far higher spatiotemporal resolution and more kinematic detail than currently possible. To overcome the limitations of current technologies, a new solution is proposed that synergistically combines two methods - marker based motion capture and a video- based machine learning approach. First, using marker-based motion capture, the gold standard for 3D tracking in humans, the position of experimental subjects' head, trunk, and limbs will be tracked in 3D with submillimeter precision. An innovative marker design, placement strategy, and post-processing pipeline will ensure an unprecedentedly detailed description of rodent behavior over a large range of timescales. To make the system more efficient, robust, affordable and better suited for high-throughput longitudinal studies, the unprecedentedly rich and large 3D datasets generated by the motion capture experiments will be leveraged to train a deep neural network to predict pose and appendage positions from a set of 1-6 normal video cameras. To best capitalize on the large training datasets, the latest advances in convolutional neural networks for image analysis will be incorporated. Together, these advances will promote generalization of the high-resolution 3D tracking system to a variety of animals and environments, thus establishing a cheap, flexible, and easy-to use kinematic tracking method that can easily be scaled up and adopted by other labs. The large ground-truth datasets will allow the system to be benchmarked and compared against state-of-the art technologies in quantitative and rigorous ways. Preliminary studies have been very positive and suggest large improvements over current methods both when it comes to the range of behaviors that can be tracked and the precision with which they can be measured. Importantly, all new technology will be readily shared with the scientific community, thereby leveraging from this single grant the potential for numerous investigators to dramatically improve the efficiency of their research programs requiring rigorous quantitative descriptions of animal behavior. Narrative We will develop and disseminate innovative new technology for measuring precise 3D kinematics in freely moving animals over long time-periods. Our proposed experimental platform will illuminate how natural behaviors are organized and help us understand how they are controlled by the nervous system, and how this control goes awry in disease. The technological leap made possible by this grant will catalyze a host of studies on the neural mechanisms underlying motor control, learning, and mental disorders, and thus help in the discovery of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for afflicted patients.",A system for long-term high-resolution 3D tracking of movement kinematics in freely behaving animals,10120068,R01GM136972,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Callithrix', 'Cephalometry', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deer Mouse', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Learning Disorders', 'Lighting', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous System control', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'appendage', 'base', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'motor control', 'neural network', 'neuromechanism', 'new technology', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'skeletal', 'spatiotemporal']",NIGMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,411071
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository Three-dimensional anatomic modeling and simulation (3D M&S) in cardiovascular (CV) disease have become a crucial component of treatment planning, medical device design, diagnosis, and FDA approval. Comprehensive, curated 3-D M&S databases are critical to enable grand challenges, and to advance model reduction, shape analysis, and deep learning for clinical application. However, large-scale open data curation involving 3-D M&S present unique challenges; simulations are data intensive, physics-based models are increasingly complex and highly resolved, heterogeneous solvers and data formats are employed by the community, and simulations require significant high-performance computing resources. Manually curating a large open-data repository, while ensuring the contents are verified and credible, is therefore intractable. We aim to overcome these challenges by developing broadly applicable automated curation data science to ensure model credibility and accuracy in 3-D M&S, leveraging our team’s expertise in CV simulation, uncertainty quantification, imaging science, and our existing open data and open source projects. Our team has extensive experience developing and curating open data and software resources. In 2013, we launched the Vascular Model Repository (VMR), providing 120 publicly-available datasets, including medical image data, anatomic vascular models, and blood flow simulation results, spanning numerous vascular anatomies and diseases. The VMR is compatible with SimVascular, the only fully open source platform providing state-of-the-art image-based blood flow modeling and analysis capability to the CV simulation community. We propose that novel curation science will enable the VMR to rapidly intake new data while automatically assessing model credibility, creating a unique resource to foster rigor and reproducibility in the CV disease community with broad application in 3D M&S. To accomplish these goals, we propose three specific aims: 1) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of anatomic patient-specific models built from medical image data, 2) Develop and validate automated curation methods to assess credibility of 3D blood flow simulation results, 3) Disseminate the data curation suite and expanded VMR. The proposed research is significant and innovative because it will 1) enable rapid expansion of the repository by limiting curator intervention during data intake, leveraging compatibility with SimVascular, 2) increase model credibility in the CV simulation community, 3) apply novel supervised and unsupervised approaches to evaluate anatomic model fidelity, 4) leverage reduced order models for rapid assessment of complex 3D data. This project assembles a unique team of experts in cardiovascular simulation, the developers of SimVascular and creator of the VMR, a professional software engineer, and radiology technologists. We will build upon our successful track record of launching and supporting open source and open data resources to ensure success. Data curation science for 3D M&S will have direct and broad impacts in other physiologic systems and to ultimately impact clinical care in cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular anatomic models and blood flow simulations are increasingly used for personalized surgical planning, medical device design, and the FDA approval process. We propose to develop automated data curation science to rapidly assess credibility of anatomic models and 3D simulation data, which present unique challenges for large-scale data curation. Leveraging our open source SimVascular project, the proposed project will enable rapid expansion of the existing Vascular Model Repository while ensuring model credibility and reproducibility to foster innovation in clinical and basic science cardiovascular research.",Automated data curation to ensure model credibility in the Vascular Model Repository,10175029,R01LM013120,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Basic Science', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incentives', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk Assessment', 'Running', 'Science', 'Software Engineering', 'Source Code', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'computing resources', 'data curation', 'data format', 'data repository', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gigabyte', 'imaging Segmentation', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'online repository', 'open data', 'open source', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'stem', 'success', 'supercomputer', 'supervised learning', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning', 'trustworthiness', 'unsupervised learning', 'web portal']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,330299
"Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function Project Summary mRNA degradation is an essential process in post-translational gene regulation, and influences protein expression levels in cells. In S. cerevisea the lifetime of mRNA ranges from 43 sec to 39 min, with a median half-life of 3.6 min. The molecular factors governing these differential degradation rates has long been an area of active research. Recently though, clear evidence has emerged that the codon optimality correlates with half- lives. At a mechanistic level, the emerging perspective is that some transcripts are translated quickly, and some slowly, and that transcripts in which ribosomes end up forming queues, much like a traffic jam of cars on a highway, are recognized by ubiquitin ligases such as Hel2 that trigger the RQC pathway to promote mRNA degradation. There are two major gaps in this field. The first is the capability to predict mRNA half-lives accurately from mRNA sequence features. The second is understanding at the molecular level how the distribution of codon translation speeds along a transcript’s coding sequence promote ribosome queues and hence degradation. In this proposal, a graduate student will combine the PI’s labs expertise in modeling the kinetics of translation and ribosome traffic with interpretable machine learning techniques to address these two gaps. In achieving this, the field will be advanced by having both predictive and explanatory models for how translation speed and codon usage differentially impacts the degradation rates of different mRNAs. Specifically, our first aim is to build an interpretable machine learning model to identify robust and predictive features governing mRNA degradation. Our second aim is to explain at the molecular level why these features influence degradation rates. We will do this in two ways. First, we will use the essential and predictive features resulting from the interpretable machine learning model to identify potential underlying mechanisms contributing to degradation. Second, we will simulate the movement of ribosomes on each transcript based on reported initiation and elongation rates to detect ribosome queues and provide an explanation for differential degradation rates. Finally, our third aim is to test the predictions coming from the models. For example, do the models from Aim 1 accurately predict mRNA half-lives when synonymous mutations are introduced? There is sufficient published data on transcriptome-wide mRNA half-lives on S. cerevisiae to train and test the machine learning models in Aim 1. Further, we have arranged for a machine learning expert to co-advise the graduate student on the second aim. This co-advisor is already a collaborator of the PI on other machine learning projects. Finally, a collaborator who has measured mRNA half-lives will further advise the student on the third aim. In summary, this training supplement will address cutting edge questions in the molecular biology and biophysics of mRNA lifetimes and provide the student the opportunity to get advanced training and expertise in machine learning, molecular modeling, and experimental techniques. Project Narrative Messenger RNA (mRNA) half-lives are influenced by the rate of protein synthesis and the ribosome traffic jams that can form on transcripts when slow-translating codons are encountered by ribosomes. The complex distribution of codon usage across transcripts, and the interplay of initiation and elongation rates that can create ribosome queues make it difficult to predict an mRNA's half-life based on its sequence. Here, we will apply machine learning to accurately predict mRNA half-lives from sequence, and combine it with biophysical modeling to understand the molecular events regulating mRNA degradation.",Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function,10307359,R35GM124818,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Half-Life', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Speed', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'graduate student', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'models and simulation', 'molecular modeling', 'protein expression', 'protein structure function', 'ribosome profiling', 'simulation', 'transcriptome', 'ubiquitin ligase']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R35,2021,31246
"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,10128374,R03AI146437,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acrylates', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Antibiotics', 'Applications Grants', 'Bacteria', 'Cells', 'Chlamydia', 'Chlamydia Infections', 'Chlamydia genome', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye Infections', 'Gel', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lead', 'Light Microscope', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'PF4 Gene', 'Penicillins', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sodium', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chlamydia vaccine', 'human pathogen', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,77243
"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10165490,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,528873
"Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research PROJECT SUMMARY  Abnormalities of white matter are important in schizophrenia. A preponderance of studies have found decreased levels of transcripts for myelin-related proteins in autopsy brains. Some have found a decrease in the proteins themselves, and some have not. Hundreds of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have found reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the brains of many people with schizophrenia (SCH). Prefrontal white matter is among the areas usually involved. Decreased FA is interpreted as disruption of normal architecture. However, postmortem examination has failed to identify characteristic abnormalities, suggesting that abnormalities causing diminished FA are subtle, and that postmortem examinations have not used the right tools to find them. We have therefore been developing, as part of a FIC/NIMH collaboration with the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, two new methods to characterize white matter at high resolution. The first is a machine learning protocol to measure axonal diameters and myelin sheath thickness in electron microscope (EM) images of prefrontal white matter, recognizing and avoiding artifacts in EM of autopsy tissue. This will enable us to measure thousands of fibers in EM images, from individuals with SCH, major depressive disorder (MDD), or no psychiatric illness (NPI). The second method, suggested by the DTI findings, is to analyze the spatial orientation of the axons themselves. We will use 3-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of high-resolution images of the axons themselves, identified by Bielschowsky silver stain or immunohistochemistry for phosphorylated neurofilament protein. To obtain high- resolution images of Bielschowsky stains, we will take advantage of the recent observation by Dr. Mark Sonders, co-investigator on this project, that these and other heavy metal stains luminesce under 2-photon infrared excitation. This technique yields clear images of individual axons that can be traced and measured in 3 dimensions. We will perform these procedures on sections from existing paraffin blocks that comprise a complete left prefrontal coronal section from 36 triads containing 1 case each of SCH, MDD, or NPI, matched for sex and age. These brains were included in earlier studies that yielded data on protein composition, mRNA for myelin- related proteins, DNA methylation, microglial activation, and semiquantitative myelin histology. In a third, exploratory aim, we will employ graphical models in three multi-omics data fusion approaches to combine different types of high-dimensional data, including those produced by Aims 1 and 2, with known structural properties of axons and myelin in white matter, in order to build a model or detect novel dependencies of what is disturbed in schizophrenia. We expect that novel techniques for data fusion will reveal associations based on multidimensional correlations that could not be detected by modeling the single-domain datasets separately. NARRATIVE Our ongoing research in North Macedonia and at Columbia University / New York State Psychiatric Institute has demonstrated biochemical abnormalities of white matter in schizophrenia that are not present in major depressive disorder. However, we have not seen anatomical abnormalities of white matter, which MRI studies of schizophrenia tell us should exist, and as the biochemistry also suggests. To explore white matter in novel ways, we are developing new methods of microscopy, image analysis and statistical inference, which we now propose to employ on a large scale to study schizophrenia.",Application of Advanced Quantitative Methods to Schizophrenia Research,10099068,R01MH125030,"['3-Dimensional', 'Academy', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consensus', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deformity', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electron Microscope', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fiber', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Heavy Metals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Interviewer', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Left', 'Macedonia', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myelin', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurofilament Proteins', 'New York', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Online Systems', 'Optic Nerve', 'Paraffin', 'Pathologist', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychologist', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Shotguns', 'Silver Staining', 'Space Perception', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'data archive', 'data fusion', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'high resolution imaging', 'histological studies', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'network models', 'novel', 'precursor cell', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'symposium', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy', 'two-photon', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,641403
"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II 1 Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large, multi-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA- and BD2K- funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for the multi-site QC workflows that will come with the unified platform that MIQA represents: a design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that simplifies the creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific results findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site, web-based software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system and machine learning to aid in QC processes. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automated notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, MIQA is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop a web-based, multi-site, open-source platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. MIQA will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies. Our effort will minimize the time spent on labor-intensive reviews and analysis operations by supporting team-oriented reviewing that is guided by highly customizable workflows seamlessly interacting with existing data management systems.",mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II,10183329,R44MH119022,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Alcohols', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'FAIR principles', 'Four-dimensional', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Iowa', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurosciences', 'Notification', 'Online Systems', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Writing', 'annotation  system', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dexterity', 'image archival system', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'open source', 'operation', 'quality assurance', 'research study', 'software systems', 'success', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'web interface']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2021,797476
"Development of A High Throughput Image-Guided IMRT System for Preclinical Research Project Summary/Abstract Preclinical radiobiology experiments on small animals are crucial to test the safety and efficacy before human clinical trials. However, limited by currently available technologies, preclinical animal studies substantially differ from state-of-the-art human treatments in dose conformity. Consequently, the animal studies poorly mimic the radiobiological, radioimmunological, and toxicity environment of human therapies. The disparity adversely affects our ability to meaningfully test hypotheses that are intended for human translation. With decades of advancement, human radiotherapy has achieved high targeting accuracy and dose conformality based on technological breakthroughs, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), which is unavailable for mouse experiments. A practical device and algorithm to modulate the x-ray intensity for the scale of small animals is the first step to bridge the gap. With the support of an NIH R21 grant, we engineered a novel small animal IMRT dose modulator termed sparse orthogonal collimator (SOC). Equally important as the hardware, we created the enabling mathematical tools to deliver SOC IMRT plans with higher achievable resolution than a theoretically miniaturized MLC-based IMRT. We commissioned and tested prototypical SOCs to deliver highly modulated doses in silico and on phantoms. Nonetheless, there are still large gaps between an intensity modulation device and a small animal IMRT system suitable for broad adoption and impact. The required time, resources, and training to create sophisticated SOC-IMRT plans are incompatible with preclinical settings. Furthermore, without automation, the existing image-guided small animal IMRT treatment is prohibitively slow for treating live animals under anesthesia. Lastly, the current manual method to switch between imaging and therapy modes results in intractable uncertainties in dose delivery. We propose to fill these gaps using automation, robotics, and system optimization. We propose the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1 (SA1). Automated organ segmentation for mice using deep learning neural networks. Specific Aim 2 (SA2). Development of a fully functional, automated, and efficient IMRT system. Specific Aim 3 (SA3). Development and validation of a robotic Multi Mouse Automated Treatment Environment (Multi-MATE) for automated imaging and treatment. Besides dosimetry, we will quantify the time performance, which is critical to small animal IMRT system. As a result, in addition to improving the hardware accuracy and reliability, the proposed project will provide a fully automated planning and delivery system, thus removing the last barriers towards the broad adoption of small animal IMRT. The success of the proposed project will help existing research to achieve the full potential for human translation and enable future hypotheses testing where accurate complex dose distribution is critical. Project Narrative A major impediment in translating animal radiation studies to human patients is the disparity in radiation techniques. Existing methods cannot create human like conformal radiation dose on mice with necessary accuracy and efficiency. To better mimic human treatment without prohibitively complicated and slow procedures, we propose to develop a high throughput image guided small animal conformal irradiation platform.",Development of A High Throughput Image-Guided IMRT System for Preclinical Research,10317441,R01CA259008,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Animals', 'Automation', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collimator', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conformal Radiotherapy', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiobiology', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'biological research', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'dosimetry', 'experimental study', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'irradiation', 'miniaturize', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'process optimization', 'robotic system', 'safety testing', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'trend', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,441662
"CSHL Network Biology Conference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal seeks support for the conference on Network Biology, to take place March/April 2021 to 2025, at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). This meeting, held in biannual rotation on the CSHL campus in New York, brings together senior and junior scientists from both experimental and computational laboratories with common interests in network biology. The meeting will emphasize new discoveries and provide an open forum for the presentation of the latest research and results on molecular networks and their relevance to normal and abnormal cellular physiology. It will be essential for advancing knowledge in all aspects of the network modeling process, from data generation in experimental cell biology to data analysis and computer simulation and from the development and validation of network models describing these data to biological inferences made from the models. The conference will include platform sessions on interaction networks, signaling and network dynamics, regulatory networks, computational tools, artificial intelligence and big data, multi-scale networks, networks and disease, networks in differentiation, microbiome networks, network evolution, synthetic networks, network engineering and networks beyond biology though the exact program for the meeting will be assembled after the abstract submission deadline in February 2021 and adapted to ongoing developments in the field in subsequent years. This conference will include significant components designed to facilitate the active participation of younger scientists such as selection of platform speakers on the basis of the scientific merit of their submitted abstracts as well as poster presentations, round tables, lightning talks and poster prizes. Distinguished speakers will also be invited to give platform talks and interact with more junior scientists. The intimate environment at CSHL fosters social interactions and active participation by all. The majority of participants to the previous CSHL Network Biology meeting expressed that they were “very satisfied”. Speakers' panels have consisted of at least 50% women; the gender balance will be maintained in future meetings. In the 2019 iteration of the meeting, a panel discussion was established to address the challenges of Women in Network Science. We will continue to address big community challenges though panel discussions in this meeting. In 2021, we will discuss Applicability and Translatability of Network Biology with panelists including network biologists whose work is deeply influential throughout the ongoing covid-19 pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biological systems are functionally and structurally formed by complex networks of interacting molecular components, many of which are encoded in the genome. Elucidating the structure and function of these networks and understanding how their dysregulation causes disease are critical steps toward improving human health.

However, if these methods are to be used in a viral control strategy they must reliably account for uncertainty and be able to perform inference on 1,000s of genomes in actionable time. Scaling Bayesian phylogenet- ics to meet this need is a grand challenge that is unlikely to be met by optimizing existing algorithms.  We will meet this challenge with a radically new approach: Bayesian variational inference for phylogenet- ics (VIP) using ﬂexible distributions on phylogenetic trees that are ﬁt using gradient-based methods analogous to how one efﬁciently trains massive neural networks. By taking a variational approach we will also be able to integrate phylogenetic analysis into very powerful open-source modeling frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. This will open up new classes of models, such as neural network models, to integrate data such as sampling location and migration patterns with phylogenetic inference. These ﬂexible models will inform strategies for viral control.  In Aim 1 we will develop the theory necessary for scalable and reliable VIP, including subtree marginal- ization, local gradient updates needed for online algorithms, convergence diagnostics, and parameter support estimates. We will implement these algorithms in our C++ foundation library for VIP. In Aim 2 we will develop a ﬂexible TensorFlow-based modeling platform for phylogenetics, enabling a whole new realm of phylogenetic models based on neural networks to learn phylodynamic heterogeneity with minimal program- ming effort. We will provide efﬁcient gradients to this implementation via our C++ library. In Aim 3 we will use the fact that VIP posteriors are durable and extensible descriptions of the full data posterior to enable dynamic online computation of variational posteriors, including divide-and-conquer Bayesian phylogenetics. This work will enable a cloud-based viral phylogenetics solution to rapidly update our current estimate of the posterior distribution when new data arrive or the model is modiﬁed. 1 Project Narrative We have seen in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as for all major pathogen outbreaks in the last decade, how phylogenetic (i.e. evolutionary tree) methods are required to use viral genomic information to under- stand large-scale transmission patterns. However, current phylogenetic methods have two major limitations as a tool for viral control: ﬁrst, rigorous Bayesian probabilistic methods cannot scale to 1,000s of genomes, and second, models incorporating phylogenetic trees must be expressed in specialized phylogenetics pack- ages, making modern machine-learning approaches impossible. In this proposal, we develop variational ap- proaches to phylogenetics, which will allow fast inference and procedures to rapidly update inferences when new data arrives, as well as making phylogenetic trees a ﬁrst-class inferential object in major machine-learning packages. 1",Fast and flexible Bayesian phylogenetics via modern machine learning,10266670,R01AI162611,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Bayesian Method', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemic', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genome', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pattern', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Predisposition', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'data modeling', 'epidemiologic data', 'flexibility', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical methods', 'migration', 'neural network', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'scale up', 'social exclusion', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'user-friendly', 'viral genomics', 'viral transmission']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,797370
"Integrating Biology into In Silico Methodologies: Modern approaches for incorporating biological reasoning and understanding into computational methods. 1 This proposal is for PA-18-648, NIH Support for Conferences and Scientific Meetings –  2 funding intended to help finance a two-day standalone “SOT CCT” workshop titled Integrating  3 Biology into In Silico Methodologies: Modern Approaches for incorporating biological  4 reasoning and understanding into computational methods. As a “Contemporary Concepts  5 in Toxicology” meeting, this workshop has the full backing, including being financially  6 underwritten, by the Society of Toxicology.  7 Computational modeling is an important tool for assessing the safety and use of  8 chemicals across many industries, including chemical, pharmaceutical, and consumer products.  9 Moreover, in silico methodologies offer academia and regulatory a fast and cheap method of 10 prioritizing its efforts to maintain compliance and safety in the market and environment. 11 This conference is designed to promote the development of actionable insights and 12 methodologies for increasing the biological relevance of in silico solutions. Specifically, this 13 conference will focus on solving the “black box effect”. There are many ways to validate a 14 model’s accuracy and domain – however if the model cannot explain what is happening 15 biologically, its use is severely diminished. This workshop will bring together regulatory, 16 academia, industry, and service providers to discuss current solutions and efforts, as well as 17 ongoing and future research. One goal of this conference will be to develop a roadmap for the 18 incorporation of AOPs (and similar biological reasonings) for computational tools. 19 This workshop has great appeal for multiple stakeholders within toxicology, namely 20 industry, academia, regulators, as well as service providers. The use of machine-learning to 21 replace laboratory toxicological tests is paramount to the future of the industry (3Rs). The use 22 of in silico models are explicitly referenced by NICEATM’s U.S. Strategic Roadmap, as well as 23 TSCA. Moreover, many industries and regulatory entities are taking significant steps away from 24 animal testing. Most recently, the US EPA stated that it will eliminate animal testing by 2035. 25 This workshop will bring together different stakeholders to discuss the current state of 26 AOPs and in silico methodologies, and to work towards a unified approach for their 27 incorporation. The final outcome of the workshop will be a white-paper that not only reviews the 28 current landscape but discusses concretes steps, as outlined in the breakout session, needed 29 for the regulatory acceptance of machine learning technologies – specifically a roadmap for the 30 inclusion of AOPs into computational tools and explanations.

"Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality Over the past 15 years, new imaging technologies and methods for high throughput imaging have revolutionized structural biology by extending the resolution and scale of collected images in 3 dimensions. The resulting image volumes are more typically hundreds of GB to even tens of TB and in some cases approach PB sizes. These file sizes pose challenges for image acquisition, image analysis, and communication of a representative set of raw data and quantification. Image acquisition runs can be lengthy and expensive, and often errors are not identified until after the completion of scanning. Large files contain many structures, and require machine learning (ML) strategies in a context that permits error correction. Scientific communication requires tools for ready access to raw data, and more efficient methods to communicate the rapidly accumulating sets of scientific information. We propose to leverage virtual reality (VR) and verbal communication within the VR environment, to streamline each of these stages of scientific work, by capitalizing on the more natural abilities for stereoscopic vision and hearing to process scenes and language. Based upon the tool base and direct volume rendering of large files that we have established in our VR software, called syGlass, we will first integrate VR into the microscope controls for tuning the microscope and then efficiently inspecting images in 3D as they are acquired (Aim 1). Next, we will introduce novel domain adaptation techniques in the ML field to scale up 3D image quantification capabilities for current acquisition sizes, by coupling them with user-optimized experiences that do not require ML expertise, and yet provide automated and accurate results (Aim 2). Finally, we will provide tools to efficiently generate narrated scientific presentations in VR for use in the lab setting, as manuscript publications, and for production of educational materials (Aim 3). In each of these activities, we will introduce paradigm shifts in the management of experiments, analysis of the resulting data, and publication of manuscripts and materials to other scientists and the general public. The goal of this project is to speed the pipeline from image acquisition to communication of analyzed data for large image files (big data). We propose to leverage virtual reality to change the way users interact with their microscope, provide new methods for more accurate quantification and make scientific data more transparent, and more accessible to specialists and the general public. These new paradigms are applicable to basic, pre-clinical and clinical research, and serve the goals of big data projects to generate more reliable and encompassing scientific conclusions.","Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality",10143312,R44MH125238,"['3-Dimensional', '3D virtual reality', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Depth Perception', 'Educational Materials', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Distribution', 'Ingestion', 'Instruction', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Resort', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'adaptation algorithm', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'field study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'movie', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical research', 'scale up', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment']",NIMH,ISTOVISR,R44,2021,499966
"An Agent-Based Modeling Platform for Environmental Biotechnology Hazardous pollutants in the environment continue to threaten public health and environmental  safety. Human exposure to major contaminant classes, such as polyfluorinated compounds  (PFCs), hazardous organic compounds (HOCs), and heavy metals, has been linked to a variety of  diseases and is subject to stringent State and Federal environmental regulations.  Bioremediation is a low-cost and environmentally friendly approach with many successful  use-cases; however, conventional bioremediation technologies can suffer from unreliability, low  degradation rates, and incomplete degradation. As stakeholders to Superfund sites and other sites  with water or soil pollution urgently demand more efficient, less costly and more reliable  remediation technologies, it is critical to look to advancements in computational  modeling to develop next-generation, precision-engineered bioremediation technologies. The proposed project builds on successful outcomes from Phase I in which a new computational  platform was designed and validated to accurately predict the bioremediation kinetics of  a multi-organism microcosm degrading a combination of HOCs in groundwater. The basis of  this platform is an approach called agent-based modeling (ABM), where the functions of  individual components (e.g. microorganisms) within complex ecosystems are used to predict and  optimize system-level properties (e.g. bioremediation kinetics). In this Phase II project, the novel computational platform developed in Phase I is  further improved with a machine learning component that leverages bioinformatics  databases to develop rationally tailored microbiomes for degrading complex pollutant  mixtures. Iterative experimental validation of model outputs is conducted using an innovative  materials science platform that maintains the relative concentration of different species in the  microbiome constant within the multi-zone treatment barrier (in-situ) or multi-zone bioreactor  (ex-situ). The project includes focused development of a prototype for one bioremediation use-case,  which is directly compared to a conventional (non-precision) bioremediation system treating   actual contaminated groundwater. This will be performed in order to assess and quantify  the expected technical and economic benefits of harnessing the project's novel computational  platform in biotechnology development. The broad, long-term impact of the proposed project will be to transform the development and  implementation of bioremediation by integrating advancements in computational modeling, machine  learning, bioinformatics, and materials science. By leveraging novel tools across disciplines, the  project will accelerate the development of more precise, reliable and inexpensive technologies for  environmental remediation. The successful outcome of the proposed project will also provide new  collaborative opportunities for industry and academia to more rapidly address the remediation of  high-priority pollutants in the environment, and ultimately help mitigate the effects of hazardous  pollutants on communities impacted by the presence of environmental contamination.

"Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurological disorders and affects over 2.5 million people each year, yet no treatment has successfully translated from bench to clinic. TBI is a broad term and encompasses an extremely heterogeneous set of injuries differing by cause, severity, biomechanics, and the varied, complex secondary injury responses that collectively result in chronic disabilities. Current preclinical research circumvents the issue of TBI heterogeneity by relying on specific preclinical animal models that mimic subpopulations of patients and particular secondary injury mechanisms with each study focusing on limited, individual pathways. This proposal instead aims to tackle TBI heterogeneity by approaching TBI as a “big data” problem and aggregating and analyzing the multidimensional data collectively. A framework for data harmonization and curation will be developed, and datasets from a consortium of preclinical labs employing a variety of preclinical TBI models will be collected and curated into an open data commons (ODC-TBI). Utilizing machine learning and multidimensional analytics, the proposed research will directly leverage TBI heterogeneity in the merged dataset to identify persistent features of TBI to empower translational research. By creating a preclinical TBI ODC and applying machine learning to integrate the heterogeneity of preclinical TBI models, the project will reveal multidimensional features of TBI across heterogeneous injuries and characterize how diverse secondary injury mechanisms interact and ultimately affect injury outcome. Throughout the project's timeline, new datasets will continue to be harmonized into the ODC-TBI according to the established framework. The ODC-TBI will be the first open multicenter, multi-model repository of preclinical TBI data and will enable the application of data science to the field of TBI. Furthermore, the ODC-TBI and the methods implemented throughout the project will be openly shared to improve reproducibility of TBI research. Together with the multidimensional analysis that will provide quantitative and qualitative understanding of TBI heterogeneity, the project aims to ultimately accelerate data- driven discovery and precision medicine for TBI. Reflecting the complexities of clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI), preclinical TBI research is confounded by the extreme heterogeneity prevalent across possible injury models and resulting biological responses. The proposed research will aggregate and curate an extensive open data commons (ODC) of preclinical TBI research with multiple TBI models and utilize machine learning to tackle TBI heterogeneity directly. The project will create an ODC for preclinical TBI research to improve data sharing and scientific reproducibility, and will empower translational TBI research by identifying multidimensional features of TBI that best predict functional outcome.",Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility,10212363,F32NS117728,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Closed head injuries', 'Common Data Element', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'behavioral outcome', 'bench to bedside', 'biomarker discovery', 'controlled cortical impact', 'data curation', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple datasets', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'open data', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'response to injury']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2021,71224
"Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer Project Summary In 2010, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) and D.E. Shaw Research (DESRES) partnered to make the Anton special-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) supercomputer available to the national biomedical research community for the first time. Anton enabled researchers to simulate biomolecular systems two orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer, allowing researchers access to critical multi- microsecond and longer timescales on which most biologically-significant molecular processes take place. In 2016, with operational support from NIH, DESRES made available a next generation Anton 2 system at PSC at no cost. This multimillion-dollar gift from DESRES, with NIH support, provided a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle even more groundbreaking biological questions by simulating systems as large as 700,000 atoms at a rate of multiple microseconds per day. The goal of this renewal project is to provide the national biomedical research community with continued access to this unique and powerful Anton 2 resource and to maximize the benefit of this resource to the community. Since 2010, PSC has supported 589 research projects conducted by 202 unique PIs on the Anton systems hosted at PSC. So far, these projects have resulted in 292 publications, many of which have had significant impact on their fields of research. These fields cover the entire spectrum of biomolecular processes that form the fundamental underpinnings of biology, including protein folding, ion channel selectivity and gating, membrane dynamics and organization, protein- ligand binding, and many others. Demand for Anton 2 is quite high, with 2-3x higher demand than can be met each year. Given this, our goals are focused not only on providing continued access but also on maximizing the value of this limited resource to the community—recognizing that the creativity of the broad, diverse Anton 2 research community is one of our most powerful resources for innovation. Anton 2 will be integrated as an XSEDE service provider, and the accessibility and impact of Anton 2 will significantly increase by engaging in their extensive broadening participation, outreach, and training programs. Through these outreach efforts, researchers at many more institutions will have the opportunity to use Anton 2, especially researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups in biomedical research. The hundreds of long-timescale MD trajectories researchers generate on Anton 2 constitute a unique and valuable dataset that can be used to gain additional biomedical knowledge and advance the application of machine learning protocols to augment molecular dynamics simulations. This important dataset will be available to researchers and educators worldwide through a web portal and co-located on the PSC's Bridges-2 system for classroom instruction and research, including reanalysis, machine learning, and data mining. Project Narrative The Anton 2 supercomputer made available at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center through this award will enable researchers to simulate biomolecular systems orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer.

"Accelerating Community-Driven Medical Innovation with VTK Abstract Thousands of medical researchers around the world use VTK —the Visualization Toolkit— an open-source, freely available software development toolkit providing advanced 3D interactive visualization, image processing and data analysis algorithms. They either use VTK directly in their in-house research applications or indirectly via one of the multitude of medical image analysis and bioinformatics applications that is built using VTK: Osirix, 3D Slicer, BioImageXD, MedINRIA, SCIRun, ParaView, and others. Furthermore, VTK also provides 3D visualizations for clinical applications such as BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system and Zimmer’s prosthesis design and evaluation platform. VTK has been downloaded many hundreds of thousands of times since its initial release in 1993. Considering its broad distribution and prevalent use, it can be argued that VTK has had a greater impact on medical research, and patient care, than any other open-source visualization package.  This proposal is in response to the multitude of requests we have been receiving from the VTK medical community. The aims are as follows:  1. Aim 1: Adaptive visualization framework: Produce an integrated framework that supports  visualization applications that balance server-side and client-side processing depending on data size,  analysis requirements, and the user platform (e.g., phone, tablet, or GPU-enabled desktop).  2. Aim 2: Integrated, interactive applications: Extend VTK to support a diversity of programming  paradigms ranging from C++ to JavaScript to Python and associated tools such as Jupyter Notebooks,  integrating with emerging technologies such as deep learning technologies.  3. Aim 3: Advanced rendering, including AR/VR: Target shader-based rendering systems and AR/VR  libraries that achieve high frame rates with minimal latency for ubiquitous applications that combine  low-cost, portable devices such as phones, ultrasound transducers, and other biometric sensors for  visually monitoring, guiding, and delivering advanced healthcare.  4. Aim 4: Infrastructure, Outreach, and Validation: Engage the VTK community and the proposed  External Advisory Board during the creation and assessment of the proposed work and corresponding  modern, digital documentation in the form of videos and interactive web-based content. Project Narrative The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source, freely available software library for the interactive display and processing of medical images. It is being used in most major medical imaging research applications, e.g., 3D Slicer and Osirix, and in several commercial medical applications, e.g., BrainLAB’s VectorVision surgical guidance system. VTK development began in 1993 and since then an extensive community of users and developers has grown around it. However, the rapid advancement of cloud computing, GPU hardware, deep learning algorithms, and VR/AR systems require corresponding advances in VTK so that the research and products that depend on VTK continue to deliver leading edge healthcare technologies.

"Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research Data science holds the promise of enabling new pathways to discovery and can improve the understanding, prevention and treatment of complex disorders such as cancer, diabetes, substance abuse, etc., which are significantly on the rise. The promise of data science can be fully realized only when collected data can be collaboratively shared and analyzed. However, the widespread increases in healthcare data breaches due to inappropriate access as well as the increasing number of novel privacy attacks restrict institutions from sharing data. Indeed, in some cases, the results of the analysis can themselves lead to significant privacy harm. The success of the data commons depends on ensuring the maximal access to data, subject to all of the patient privacy requirements including those mandated by legislation, and all of the constraints of the organization collecting the data itself. While there are existing solutions that can solve parts of the problem, there are significant challenges in truly incorporating these into comprehensive working solutions that are usable by the biomedical research community, and new challenges brought on by modern techniques such as deep learning. The long-term goal of this research is to develop technologies that can holistically enable data sharing while respecting privacy and security considerations and to ensure that they are implemented in existing platforms that have widespread acceptance in the research community. Towards this, the objective of this project is to develop complementary solutions for risk inference, distributed learning, and access control that can enable different modalities of data sharing. The problems studied are general in nature and will evolve depending on research successes and new impediments that arise. The proposed program of research is significant since lack of access to biomedical data can lead to fragmentation of care, resulting in higher economic and social costs, and is a significant impediment to biomedical research. The project will result in open-source, freely available software tools that will be integrated into widely used data collection, cohort identification, and distributed analytics platforms. There are several ongoing collaborations that will serve as initial pilot customers to provide use cases, identify the requirements, evaluate results, and in general validate the developed solutions. Project Narrative Statement of Relevance to Public Health Being able to ensure privacy and security while enabling data sharing and analysis is critical to pave the way forward for public health research and improve our understanding of diseases. The proposed work will address the challenges that impede the use of data across all of the different modalities of data sharing. The integration into existing platforms will ensure that the developed models, tools, and solutions directly impact the research community and improve public health interventions.",Developing novel technologies that ensure privacy and security in biomedical data science research,10077318,R35GM134927,"['Address', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Science', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Institution', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Security', 'Software Tools', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Work', 'biomedical data science', 'care fragmentation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient privacy', 'programs', 'public health intervention', 'public health research', 'social', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,R35,2021,383279
"Large-scale data integration and harmonization to accurately predict sites facing future health-based drinking water crises Project summary: Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems. This leads to at least 16 million cases of acute gastroenteritis directly linked to pollution at community water systems, with tens of millions more directly impacted by chemical and organic pollutants. Impacts are further exacerbated in locations dealing with water scarcity, in under-served populations, and within other vulnerable populations already suffering from health disparities. Many of these water problems are the direct result of managerial negligence, inconsistent monitoring, and a lack of the ability to anticipate where problems may arise next. While the reasons for drinking water problems are complex, if we could anticipate where health-based drinking water problems were to occur in the future, it could have an immediate and positive impact on tens of millions of Americans annually. Interestingly, extensive data about water quality and the performance of municipal water systems already exists in large, disparate databases. These databases are largely ignored and, when used, are typically used only anecdotally and retroactively. Preliminary evidence suggests that these existing databases, which contain histories of administrative violations and sub-threshold water-quality results, can be mined to accurately predict future drinking water crises. The Superior Statistical Research R&D team is an internationally recognized group of water experts with cross-cutting expertise in statistics/data analysis/modelling/computing, water-quality monitoring of biological and chemical contaminants, and the ability to clearly and compellingly translate water-quality and health information to actionable steps for individuals, organizations and communities. In this Phase I project, we will show that it is possible to predict water-related, health-based problem areas utilizing already collected, historical data on water quality and municipal water system performance. We will begin by harmonizing the disparate water quality and municipal water system performance in two different states (Michigan and Iowa). We will then utilize machine-learning techniques to predict health-based violation histories and will evaluate our methods by comparing predicted violations to actual health-based violations in the previous 5 years. Finally, we will identify at least 10 municipalities determined by our algorithm to be at the highest risk for future health- based water problems and will do systematic sampling to confirm our model-based predictions. We will then demonstrate how making these predictions can be leveraged to profitability by exploring how our model-based predictions can be presented to customers in an economical, usable form. Proof of our concept and profitability models in two states (Phase I) will set us up for widespread (multi-state) database harmonization and improvement of the proposed machine-learning/modelling effort in Phase II. With multi-state harmonized datasets, identification of key data gaps in particular states/areas, and proven financial models, our technology will ultimately lead to dramatic reductions in the number of health-based drinking water problems annually. Project Narrative Up to 45 million people per year in the U.S. are directly impacted by health-based drinking water problems, but predicting where and when these health-based drinking water problems will occur remains a large and complex obstacle. Current approaches focus on a reactive approach to health-based water-quality violations in community water systems, rather than a proactive one that seeks to anticipate where problems will occur in the future. The overall goal of this project is to leverage large and disparate historical datasets of water quality to accurately predict locations of future health-based water-quality violations, validate the predictions, and commercialize our proprietary predictions as a practical and cost-saving approach to anticipating and heading off future health-based water problems.",Large-scale data integration and harmonization to accurately predict sites facing future health-based drinking water crises,10253600,R43ES033134,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Chemicals', 'Cities', 'Coal', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complex', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Filtration', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Lead', 'Lead levels', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Municipalities', 'Negligence', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pollution', 'Price', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Serinus', 'Site', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Underserved Population', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Water', 'advocacy organizations', 'base', 'commercialization', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'drinking water', 'economic impact', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inner city', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'member', 'pollutant', 'predictive modeling', 'research and development', 'rural area', 'statistics', 'water quality', 'water sampling', 'water testing', 'willingness to pay']",NIEHS,"SUPERIOR STATISTICAL RESEARCH, LLC",R43,2021,256579
"A High Performance Research Image Repository (RIR) for the Washington University Center of High Performance Computing (CHPC) Project Summary/Abstract: We propose to build a Research Image Repository (RIR) to house large collections of biomedical imaging data. The RIR will include datasets produced locally at Washington University: The Connectome Coordination Facility (CCF) (which itself includes the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Young Adult study, The Lifespan related projects, the Disease related projects, and assorted HCP-related projects), The Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC), the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, The Comprehensive Neuro-Oncology Data Repository (CONDR), and the clinically-based PACS image repository. In addition, copies of external data collections such as the UK Biobank, The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and The Cancer Image Archive (TCIA) will be maintained. The RIR includes a data management software solution that will introduce many novel features (such as `data tagging' to enrich datasets, and advanced search features) and will allow us to leverage existing storage including the Center for High Performance Computing's (CHPC) 1.4PB of BeeGFS `scratch' storage, solid-state NVMe drives integrated into the compute nodes, and 10PB of ZFS-based storage. All storage will be presented to the user as a single file-system, while data will be migrated to different performance tiers based on the storage requirements of the datasets or processing algorithms. The RIR will be integrated into the CHPC for data processing. The proposal also includes two NVIDIA DGX A100 GPU servers providing state-of-the-art GPU- based processing power. The combination of high-quality, diverse sets of biomedical imaging data with next- generation computing power will have a transformative effect on biomedical imaging processing pipelines and nowhere will the effects be more profound than in the emerging field of Deep Learning for image processing.

"Methods for Evolutionary Genomics Analysis Summary/Abstract Continuing advances in nucleotide sequencing have resulted in the assembly of datasets containing large numbers of species, genes, and genomic segments. Phylogenomic analyses of these data are essential to progress in understanding evolutionary patterns across the tree of life, and are finding increasing numbers of applications in practical analyses that require understanding of how patterns change over time. The sheer size of phylogenomic datasets limits the practical utility of available methods due to excessive time and memory requirements. We have developed many high impact methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences, a tradition we propose to continue through this MIRA project by developing innovative methods that address new challenges in phylogenomics. We will focus on pattern-based approaches of machine learning with sparsity constraint (SL) applied to phylogenomics, as a complement to traditional model-based methods in molecular evolution and phylogenetics. In the proposed SL in Phylogenomics (SLiP) framework, we will build models that best explain the biological trait or evolutionary hypothesis of interest, with genomic loci, such as genes, proteins, and genomic segments, serving as model parameters. Preliminary results from two example applications establish the premise and promise of a general SLiP framework. In one, SLiP successfully detected loci whose inclusion in a phylogenomic dataset overtakes a consistent and contrasting signal from hundreds of other loci when inferring phylogenetic relationships. In the other example, SLiP revealed loci and biological functional categories that harbor convergent sequence evolutionary patterns associated with the emergence of the same trait in distinct evolutionary lineages. In all of these analyses, SLiP required only a small fraction of the computational time and memory demanded by traditional methods, and it enabled better evolutionary contrasts with fewer assumptions. Consequently, the successful development of SLiP will improve the feasibility, rigor, and reproducibility of large-scale data analysis. It will also democratize big data analytics via shortened analysis time and a relatively small memory footprint, and encourage the development of a new class of methods for phylogenomic analysis. This framework will be accessed from a free library of SLiP functions, which will be directly useable via command line and available in a graphical interface through integration with the MEGA software. Narrative The long-term goal of my research program is to develop methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences. In this project, we will develop a new class of phylogenomic methods based on sparse machine learning and benchmark their absolute and relative performance. New techniques and their software implementation will greatly facilitate data analyses that are vital for evolutionary and functional genomics.",Methods for Evolutionary Genomics Analysis,10086181,R35GM139540,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'base', 'comparative', 'functional genomics', 'genomic locus', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R35,2021,396250
"Experimentally guided modeling and simulation for cholera dynamics Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains a global pandemic at present. Quantitative research is urgently needed to clarify the impacts of the current vaccination campaign on the pandemic evolution and economic growth, and to guide future policy development. The overall objective of this proposal is to establish a new computational modeling framework for an investigation of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the US, and to incorporate real data to assess the impacts of COVID-19 vaccination on public health and the economy. To achieve this objective, the team will pursue three specific aims: (1) Modeling the transmission and spread of COVID-19 under the impact of vaccination; (2) Modeling the economic impact of COVID-19 vaccination; (3) Conducting a case study for the Chattanooga region in the state of Tennessee. The proposed research is significant because it will incorporate detailed characteristics and potential limitations of the current vaccination campaign (such as the vaccine efficacy, phased allocation schemes, public resistance to vaccination, and vaccine breakthrough due to new variants of SARS- CoV-2) into a sophisticated modeling framework, which will enable us to make more accurate forecasts on the progression and long-term evolution of the pandemic. As such, the project is expected to advance the current understanding of COVID-19 transmission and to quantify the interaction between epidemic spreading, economic growth, and disease prevention and intervention under the impact of COVID-19 vaccination, all of which are important for the control and management of the pandemic. The approach is innovative in the development of a computational framework that integrates novel mechanistic and machine learning models and that connects the epidemic and economic aspects of COVID-19. The innovation of this project is also reflected by the integration of sophisticated computational modeling, rigorous mathematical analysis, intensive numerical simulation, and detailed data validation. The project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration among an applied and computational mathematician with long-term interest in infectious disease modeling (Wang), an epidemiologist with extensive working experiences at CDC and a current member of the regional COVID-19 task force (Heath), a business and management professor with a background in public heath (Mullen), and a statistician with expertise in machine learning and biomedical data analytics (Ma). The success of this project will not only build a solid knowledge base for the complex transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and the health and economic impacts of COVID-19 vaccination, but also provide important guidelines for the government agencies and public health administrations in pandemic management and policy development. Project Narrative The proposed project is relevant to public health because a deep understanding of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign and its health and economic impacts will help to inform the pandemic management and improve the current practice in disease prevention and intervention. The mathematical and machine learning models developed in this project will improve such understanding and make new knowledge discovery.

"Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots - Summer Undergraduate Support Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots  Emergence of undervaccinated geographical clusters for diseases like measles has become a national concern. A number of measles outbreaks have occurred in recent months, despite high MMR coverage in the United States ( 95%). Such undervaccinated clusters can act as reservoirs of infection that can transmit the disease to a wider population, magnifying their importance far beyond what their absolute numbers might indicate. The existence and growth of such undervaccinated clusters is often known to public health agencies and health provider networks, but they typically do not have enough resources to target people in each such cluster, to attempt to improve the vaccination rate. Preliminary results show that not all undervaccinated clusters are “equal” in terms of their potential for causing a big outbreak (referred to as its “criticality”), and the rate of undervaccination in a cluster does not necessarily correlate with its criticality.  However, there are no existing methods to estimate the potential risk of such clusters, and to identify the most “critical” ones. Some of the key reasons are: (i) purely data-driven spatial statistics methods rely only on immunization coverage, which does not give any indication of the risk of an outbreak; and (ii) current causal epidemic models need to be combined with detailed incidence data, which has not been easily available.  This proposal brings together a systems science approach, combining agent-based stochastic epidemic models, and techniques from machine learning, high performance computing, data mining, and spatial statistics, along with novel public and private datasets on immunization and incidence, to develop a novel methodology for identifying critical clusters, through the following tasks: (i) Identify spatial clusters with signiﬁcantly low immunization rates, or strong anti-vaccine sentiment; (ii) Develop an agent based model for the spread of measles that incorporates detailed immunization data, and is calibrated using a novel source of incidence data; (iii) Develop methods to ﬁnd and characterize critical spatial clusters, with respect to different metrics, which capture both epidemic and economic burden, and order underimmunized clusters based on their criticality; and (iv) Use the methodology to evaluate interventions in terms of their effect on criticality. A highly interdisciplinary team involving two universities, a health care delivery organization and a state department of Health, will work together to develop this methodology. Characterization of such clusters will enable public health departments and policy makers in targeted surveillance of their regions and a more efﬁcient allocation of resources. Project Narrative  This project will develop a new methodology to quantify the potential risks of under-vaccinated spatial clusters for highly infectious diseases. It will rank the clusters based on their economic and epidemic burden which will enable public health ofﬁcials in targeted surveillance and interventions, to mitigate their risk.",Detection and characterization of critical under-immunized hotspots - Summer Undergraduate Support,10393815,R01GM109718,"['Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Clusterings', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Economic Burden', 'Economics', 'Epidemic', 'Geography', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'High Performance Computing', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measles', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'data mining', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'novel', 'provider networks', 'statistics', 'undergraduate student']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,11253
