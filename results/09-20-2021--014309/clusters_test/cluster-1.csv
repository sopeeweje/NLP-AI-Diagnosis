"Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposed K01 award will support the career development of Dr. Jade Benjamin-Chung, an Epidemiologist in the Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley. Dr. Benjamin- Chung’s career goal is to become a leader in the application of rigorous biostatistical methods to infectious disease control and elimination. To support her career development, this application proposes a study she will lead to fill an important gap in research on malaria elimination interventions. As malaria transmission declines it becomes more heterogeneous and is characterized by focal hot spots of transmission. Blanket coverage of interventions becomes impractical and is not cost-effective. Reactive, focal interventions target hot spots by delivering antimalarials to people residing near to a symptomatic malaria case that presents to a surveillance site. Focally delivered interventions aim to reduce transmission to those outside focal treatment zones, including to asymptomatic malaria cases, who are thought to be responsible for the majority of transmission in elimination settings. Thus, information about whether interventions reduce illness among intervention recipients (“direct effects”) vs. non-intervention recipients in intervention clusters (i.e., “spillover effects”) is critical to understanding whether these interventions can eliminate malaria, yet current studies have not estimated such spillover effects. This study will estimate site-specific and pooled direct effects and spillover effects in three cluster-randomized trials of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions in low malaria transmission settings in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia. The specific aims are to (1) estimate direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions on Plasmodium falciparum malaria incidence and prevalence and (2) assess whether direct effects and spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions vary by distance to intervention, intervention coverage, and time from incident case detection. Evidence of spillover effects would suggest that reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up. The absence of spillover effects would suggest that interventions did not interrupt transmission; if so, information about the spatial configuration of infections would inform who and how many people to treat using redesigned interventions. This study will apply novel machine learning-based methods for estimation of causal effects appropriate for infectious disease data. This application proposes a 4-year training plan including mentorship from two leading biostatisticians at UC Berkeley and two malaria epidemiologists at UC San Francisco. Dr. Benjamin-Chung’s training goals are to (1) develop skills in machine learning and causal inference methods for dependent data, (2) learn about malaria biology and epidemiology, and (3) enhance her software development and spatial analysis skills. UC Berkeley is the optimal place for Dr. Benjamin-Chung to advance her career goals because of its leading faculty in biostatistics, strong track record of research and teaching in infectious diseases and biostatistics, and close proximity to UCSF’s Malaria Elimination Initiative. PROJECT NARRATIVE To inform global efforts to eliminate malaria in resource-limited settings, an active area of research evaluates whether targeted interventions delivered to malaria cases recently seen at local clinics and their neighbors can halt transmission in low endemic settings. This study will use novel statistical methods to measure whether these reactive, focal interventions (presumptive treatment with antimalarials and indoor residual spraying) in Namibia, Swaziland, and Zambia can reduce transmission of Plasmodium falciparum from intervention recipients to non-recipients in nearby areas – i.e., whether interventions produce spillover effects, evidence of which would indicate that these interventions hold promise for malaria elimination. Information about the magnitude of spillover effects and the distribution of spillover effects over space, time, and intervention coverage level will inform whether reactive, focal interventions hold promise for malaria elimination when scaled up or whether interventions require modification; the methods developed in this study will form a template that can be used in other trials of focal interventions for malaria or other infectious diseases.","Measuring spillover effects of reactive, focal malaria elimination interventions",10203751,K01AI141616,"['Affect', 'Anti-malarial drug resistance', 'Antimalarials', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomass', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Falciparum Malaria', 'Filarial Elephantiases', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Insecticides', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Namibia', 'Onchocerciasis', 'Outcome', 'Parasites', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Poliomyelitis', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Site', 'Smallpox', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Methods', 'Swaziland', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trachoma', 'Training', 'Tuberculosis', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'World Health Organization', 'Zambia', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chemotherapy', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'infectious disease model', 'low income country', 'malaria transmission', 'mathematical model', 'migration', 'novel', 'scale up', 'skills', 'software development', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'trial comparing']",NIAID,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,146767
"The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate for this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award aims to become an international leader in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel health care interventions and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis that is diagnosed in utero but that persists after birth, or postnatally persistent hydronephrosis (PNH). The proposed mentored research and career development plan lays the foundation for this career and the eventual development of a standardized management strategy for PNH by generating the evidence needed to support its development and creating an ultrasound (U/S) grading tool needed to implement it in routine clinical practice. Kidney U/Ss are the main test to monitor PNH, but U/S reports are heterogeneously formatted and contain synonymous and ambiguous terms that complicate their interpretation. Another major obstacle in the field is a need to predict those at risk for worsening disease and to better understand the natural history of PNH. Aim 1 will develop a Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically translate free-text U/S reports into structured data providing the PNH grade. Aim 2 will use baseline U/S and renal scan data to predict the PNH grade at 2 years. Aim 3 will use growth curves to simulate PNH’s natural history and provide the time and frequency of disease resolution/improvement, stability, and progression. The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large tertiary care children’s hospital and core research skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. An integral part of his career development will be a continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team with complementary strengths. The candidate’s primary mentor is Rachel Hess, MD, MS. Dr. Hess is a world renown expert in implementing interventions in routine clinical care and has an exemplary track record of mentorship. Flory Nkoy, MD, MS, MPH, the candidate’s co-mentor, is an expert in bioinformatics and internationally recognized for developing, disseminating, and implementing pioneering approaches to treat chronic disease in children. Advisors include Jeffrey Ferraro, PhD, and Wendy Chapman, PhD (bioinformatics), Angela Presson, PhD (biostatistics), Patrick Cartwright, MD (pediatric urology), and Mark Ebert, MD (pediatric radiology). The proposed research and training plan will establish the candidate’s solid foundation in bioinformatics, augment his prior epidemiology and biostatistics training, and provide extraordinary training in dissemination and implementation science. This will provide him with the skills and experience necessary for a career as a successful independent researcher focused on developing, implementing, and disseminating novel management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero but persisting after birth (PNH) affects tens of thousands of infants each year in the United States, but its management is complicated by ambiguous reporting of hydronephrosis severity and a relatively limited understanding of predictors of disease outcome and knowledge of the disease’s natural history. The proposed research uses the largest known pediatric hydronephrosis cohort to develop a tool to translates free-text ultrasound reports into coded PNH grades, predict the 2-year outcome using 3-month baseline data, and apply sophisticated modeling techniques to simulate the disease’s natural history. Taken together, results from this proposal will lead to the development of a standardized management strategy for PNH and facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel treatment and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, beginning with pediatric hydronephrosis.",The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH),10086087,K08DK119535,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Infant', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Radiology', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Selection Bias', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologic Surgeon', 'Urology', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'in utero diagnosis', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatrician', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prognostic', 'research and development', 'skills', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2021,166997
"A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Allen Lee, MD is a gastroenterologist with advanced training in gastrointestinal motility whose research focuses on identifying abnormalities in host-microbial interactions to improve care in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals are to identify novel subgroups of IBS patients which inform biological responses to therapies and guide management. The proposed K23 mentored career development award includes a 3-year plan for training, didactics, and research activities that will provide Dr. Lee with the necessary skills and experience to become a successful independent investigator. Career Development: Dr. Lee will develop skills in the following four areas: 1) culture-independent approaches to study host-microbial interactions in IBS; 2) advanced biostatistical methods to study longitudinal datasets, including mixed models or generalized additive models; 3) laboratory-based translational techniques; 4) predictive analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. These training goals will directly contribute to Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals and prepare him to submit a successful R01 application. Research Context: Common treatments in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) are effective in ≤50% patients. Additionally, there are currently no methods to identify patients more likely to respond to different treatments. The current paradigm for managing IBS patients revolves around identifying and treating the predominant symptom complexes. However, this is a hugely inefficient model and leads to frustration for both patients and health care providers. This proposal seeks to determine whether a systems biology approach, which incorporates microbiome and metabolomics data along with detailed clinical phenotype information, may identify novel subgroups that inform treatment decisions in IBS-D. Research Plan: This career development award leverages an on-going clinical trial comparing the effects of a nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin with a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) in IBS-D patients to identify differences in microbial community structure and function in responders vs. non-responders to therapy. Specific Aim 1 will identify fecal microbial features by 16S rRNA sequence analysis characteristic of treatment response to rifaximin or a low FODMAP diet. Specific Aim 2 will determine how treatments with rifaximin or low FODMAP diet affect the fecal metabolome, including short chain fatty acids and bile acids, in IBS-D patients. Specific Aim 3 will develop predictive models to identify subsets of IBS-D patients responsive to treatment. We will also identify risk factors for non-response to either rifaximin or low FODMAP diet. Results from this proposal will inform two future R01 proposals to validate these findings as well as to understand the mechanisms by which host-microbial interactions may mediate response to different therapies in IBS. Project Narrative Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common but difficult condition to manage likely because it is a heterogeneous disorder. This research proposal seeks to determine whether patients with IBS- D can be better stratified by their fecal microbiome and microbiome-derived metabolites. Results from this proposal may lead to a paradigm change in the way that we manage and treat IBS and potentially lead to an era of precision medicine in IBS.",A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,10125589,K23DK124567,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bile Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Butyrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Data', 'Diarrhea', 'Diet', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Foundations', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monosaccharides', 'Multiomic Data', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Virulence Factors', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'common treatment', 'dietary', 'experience', 'fecal metabolome', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'polyol', 'potential biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'rifaximin', 'skills', 'stem', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2021,194608
"Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Advance care planning and palliative care represent evidence-based, high-quality care for patients with advanced cancer. Early identification of patients at risk of short-term mortality is a promising strategy to increase advance care planning and palliative care. However, this is limited by prognostic inaccuracy among oncology clinicians, who overestimate prognosis for 70% of their patients with advanced cancer. While recent advances in electronic health record (EHR) infrastructure and machine learning (ML) have allowed accurate identification of patient' mortality risk, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how to integrate ML prognostic algorithms alongside clinician intuition (“human-machine collaborations”) in the routine care of patients with cancer. Dr. Parikh's research objective is to develop and test human-machine collaborative systems that leverage ML algorithms to improve clinicians' prognostic accuracy in order to prompt earlier advance care planning and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. In prior work, Dr. Parikh has prospectively validated and embedded into the EHR an automated ML algorithm to predict short-term mortality risk among patients with cancer. In this application, Dr. Parikh proposes to take a fundamental next step in this work by exploring strategies to improve prognostic accuracy and decision-making among oncologists treating patients with advanced cancer. In Aim 1, Dr. Parikh will retrain and validate the existing ML mortality risk prediction algorithm by integrating recently-available patient-generated health data. In Aim 2, Dr. develop prognostic that Parikh will a vignette-based survey to assess optimal strategies of presenting ML predictions to improve accuracy. He will administer this survey to a large national sample of medical oncologists to ensure clinician perspectives are incorporated into interventions.In Aim 3, Dr. Parikh will develop two models of human-machine collaborative systems to generate real-time mortality estimates that integrate clinician and algorithm predictions. In a pragmatic multi-institutional clinical trial among patients with advanced cancer, Dr. Parikh will test the impact of human-machine collaborations on prognostic accuracy and rates of advanced care planning and palliative care referral. These findings will have important implications for patients with cancer, their caregivers, oncology clinicians, and health systems. More broadly, the methods proposed may serve as a blueprint to develop and evaluate human-machine collaborations in oncology. This facilitate judgment highly-qualified Dr. development improving research will t raining in areas vital to Dr. Parikh's career goals: dvanced predictive modeling, survey methods and and decision-making, human-machine interfaces, and pragmatic clinical trials. Dr. Parikh has two and committed mentors: Dr. Justin Bekelman, an expert i n cancer care delivery r esearch, and Jinbo Chen, an expert in EHR-based predictive model development. The proposed research and career plan will enable Dr. Parikh to transition to an independent physician-scientist devoted to the quality and applicability of predictive analytics in the care of patients with cancer. a PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because we aim to improve prognostication for patients with advanced cancer by developing frameworks to integrate clinician intuition with machine learning algorithm- based mortality risk predictions (“human-machine collaborations”), a critical step to better identify patients who may benefit from earlier advance care planning and palliative care. This research proposal will optimize an existing machine learning mortality risk prediction algorithm and methodologically assess strategies to present machine learning estimates to clinicians in order to increase prognostic accuracy, advance care planning, and palliative care among patients with advanced cancer. The project is relevant to the NCI's mission by generating fundamental knowledge to inform clinicians, researchers, and policymakers about effective methods to improve and integrate predictive algorithms into clinical practice, thereby allowing better targeting of evidence-based interventions to improve quality of life for patients with advanced cancer.",Human-Machine Collaborations to Improve Prognosis and Clinical Decision-Making in Advanced Cancer,10284721,K08CA263541,"['Advance Care Planning', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Jail', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Oncologist', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Rain', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health care service organization', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human model', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'outcome forecast', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk prediction', 'routine care']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,231174
"Contextual Representation of Tactile Information in Mouse Primary Somatosensory Cortex Career Plan and Environment of Career Development: Dr. Emanuel is a joint postdoctoral fellow in the laboratories of Drs. David Ginty and Chris Harvey who is dedicated to a career as an academic researcher. Drs. Emanuel, Ginty, and Harvey have developed a 12-point career development plan that will enable Dr. Emanuel's transition to an independent research position. This plan incorporates resources available at Harvard Medical School, including formal and informal training from the community within the Department of Neurobiology and the broader Harvard Medical School community. Formal training includes attendance at seminars on professional development and responsible conduct of research as well as engaging the wider scientific community with publication of manuscripts describing Dr. Emanuel's work and presentations at international meetings. Overall, this plan will optimally prepare Dr. Emanuel for the transition to an independent career. Research Plan: The goal of this project is to determine how the representation of complex features in primary somatosensory cortex are produced by cortical and subcortical neural circuitry and how these representations are adapted for the behavior of the animal. Specifically, the experiments in this proposal will use mouse genetic approaches and in vivo electrophysiology to address the neural underpinnings of speed, direction, and orientation tuning in primary somatosensory cortex (Aim 1). Combining in vivo electrophysiology with genetic manipulations and recording from primary somatosensory cortex will determine the extent to which these cortical representations are necessary for and adapt to performance of tactile behaviors (Aim 2). Finally, combining in vivo electrophysiology in freely moving animals with modern computer vision for monitoring behavior and the force applied to the skin will determine how neurons in primary somatosensory cortex are engaged during natural movements and environmental interactions (Aim 3). In all, these experiments will yield insight into the fundamental processes underlying sensory processing in the central nervous system. Completion of the experiments in this proposal will bolster our knowledge about how sensory systems represent the environment and the extent to which these representations are tailored to the behavioral needs of animals. The insights gained should, in the long term, be applicable to the development of machine-brain interfaces and treatments for sensory and nervous system disorders. Such development would reduce illness and disability, thereby enhancing quality of life.",Contextual Representation of Tactile Information in Mouse Primary Somatosensory Cortex,10105749,K99NS119739,"['Address', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Cutaneous', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Felis catus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Inherited', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Mechanoreceptors', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Nervous System', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Speed', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Work', 'awake', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'career development', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genetic approach', 'genetic manipulation', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'loss of function mutation', 'mechanical device', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'mouse genetics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'sensory system', 'somatosensory']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,99104
"Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for measuring the effect of a treatment or intervention. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test all research questions, whether due to cost, achieving sufficient subject sizes or when administering an arm of the trial would be unethical. To understand the effects of therapeutics, policy changes, and other interventions where it is not possible to administer a clinical trial, researchers have developed approaches that attempt to simulate clinical trials in observational data. Despite sophisticated statistical methodologies, it is not clear whether it is possible to reliably simulate a randomized controlled in observational data. We aim to quantify one potential driver of these different results, differences between the clinical trial and real-world populations. In Aim 1, we compare trials that have individual level data available to three real- world data sources. In Aim 2, we develop methodologies to infer most likely individual-level statistics from aggregate trial statistics using real world data. Finally, in Aim 3 we compare neurological trials that do not release individual level data to real world data. We then estimate the transportability of treatment estimates across different populations including: the population eligible for the trial in RWD and the population ineligible for the trial but receiving the treatment in RWD. This allows for the study of indication drift and treatment heterogeneity. By uncovering differences between these groups, we may be able to identify groups that are underrepresented in clinical trials to help reduce healthcare disparities. The K99/R00 award will allow me to gain expertise in using regulatory sciences (with mentor Dr. Florence Bourgeois and advisor Dr. Deborah Schrag) for biologic discovery (with mentors Dr. Tianxi Cai and Dr. Isaac Kohane) within neurology (with mentors Dr. Page Pennell and Dr. Clemens Scherzer). My background in statistics, informatics, genetics, and machine learning with clinical data sources ideally positions me for the proposed project. The proposed training plan, mentoring and project will provide a strong foundation for a successful transition to independent research. Clinical trial populations are a subset of the overall population and may be biased through several factors. To better understand disease, reduce healthcare disparities for underrepresented groups, assess drug approvals, and ensure safety as the indications for a drug expand it is critical to quantify how representative clinical trials are of the real-world population. Identifying enriched and underrepresented groups offers the opportunity to identify subpopulations who may have heterogeneous treatment effects and/or underlying physiologies.",Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations,10127341,K99NS114850,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Estrogens', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Menarche', 'Menopause', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perimenopause', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Placebos', 'Policies', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'arm', 'base', 'birth control', 'cost', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness analysis', 'efficacy clinical trial', 'glucosylceramidase', 'health care disparity', 'inclusion criteria', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'oncology trial', 'patient population', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'standard measure', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'unethical']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,118759
"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics.

"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,10120729,K23MH113708,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Severities', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical outcome measures', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'statistics', 'theories', 'treatment of anxiety disorders']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,186408
"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10192851,K23NS112596,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Complication', 'Contusions', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Prevention trial', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rodent Model', 'Sclerosis', 'Secondary to', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'cost estimate', 'didactic education', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'preventable epilepsy', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,191054
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision making.",Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling,10217235,K23HL144907,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioprosthesis device', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronology', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Israel', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve replacement', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'end of life', 'frailty', 'health data', 'health service use', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mid-career faculty', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'surgical risk', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,172800
"A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care Candidate: April Jorge, MD is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and an Assistant in Medicine in the Rheumatology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). After graduating from the University of Maryland magna cum laude, she received her MD from Georgetown University, and she completed her internal medicine residency at Northwestern University. She completed her rheumatology fellowship at MGH, during which she also completed the Harvard Catalyst Clinical and Translational Research Academy and began working with Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH. Dr. Jorge's prior work has resulted in 15 peer- reviewed original papers, with 13 as the first author or co-first author. Her goal is to become an independent investigator and innovative leader in patient-oriented research of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Mentorship, Training Activities, and Environment: Dr. Jorge will conduct the proposed project at MGH under the mentorship of Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH and co-mentorship of Karen Costenbader, MD, MPH and Karen Sepucha, PhD. Dr. Choi is a world-renowned, NIH-funded physician scientist in advanced clinical epidemiology of rheumatic conditions, ranging from common disorders to rare but serious disorders (e.g., SLE). He has served as a mentor for several prior K awardees. Dr. Costenbader is a clinical investigator and expert in SLE who is also an experienced mentor of K awardees. Dr. Sepucha is a leading expert in patient-centered decision science. Dr. Jorge's research will also benefit from the specific expertise of her key collaborators, including advanced clinical epidemiology methods, machine learning prediction algorithms, and decision- analytic modeling. In addition to receiving excellent mentorship, she will acquire new skills through didactics in advanced clinical epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology, risk prediction, eliciting patient preferences with a mixed methods research approach, and decision-analytic modeling. Research: SLE carries increased risks of multiple comorbidities and double the risk of death compared to the general population. Current treatment is limited in part by few proven medications and adverse treatment effects. The central goal of this research is to improve long-term SLE outcomes by integrating personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient-centered use of key lupus medications. To achieve this goal, she will risk stratify patients for potential harms of treatment, i.e., hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection with belimumab use versus other immunosuppressants, and other adverse outcomes, i.e., severe COVID-19 infection (Aim 1). She will elicit patient preferences for SLE treatment through a discrete choice experiment (Aim 2a) and will integrate patient preferences with personalized risks through a multi-criteria decision analysis to determine the optimal hydroxychloroquine dose in SLE care (Aim 2b). Completion of this proposal and training plan will position Dr. Jorge with the vital experience to become an independent clinical investigator in patient-oriented research of SLE. Project Narrative Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous systemic condition associated with serious morbidity and premature mortality, yet treatment options are limited. There is uncertainty regarding the optimal use of the two FDA-approved lupus medications, hydroxychloroquine and belimumab, due in part to the risks of adverse treatment effects including hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection. This Career Development Award focuses on applying advanced clinical epidemiology and patient-centered decision science to integrate personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient- centered use of key lupus medications, including specifically the optimal dose of hydroxychloroquine in SLE care.","A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care",10192142,K23AR079040,"['Academy', 'Adverse effects', 'Award', 'Azathioprine', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fellowship', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harm Reduction', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Internal Medicine', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycophenolate', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Premature Mortality', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Residencies', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'belimumab', 'care outcomes', 'catalyst', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'data access', 'dosage', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'renal damage', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'severe COVID-19', 'skills', 'therapy adverse effect', 'trend']",NIAMS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,174960
"Identifying effective and efficient approaches to tuberculosis screening in Brazilianprisons Abstract. The goal of this career development plan is to support Dr. Leonardo Martinez, an infectious disease epidemiologist, in developing an independent research program focused on increasing tuberculosis case detection in high-risk groups. In active tuberculosis case finding studies, the majority of individuals are unable to provide sputum. In our previous work in Brazilian prisons, mass screening for tuberculosis among incarcerated individuals found a hyperendemic level of disease burden, 3,900 cases per 100,000 prisoners. We hypothesize that the tuberculosis burden in these prisons is greater than our current estimates, as a majority of prisoners were unable to produce sputum and therefore were not evaluated by diagnostic tools such as GeneXpert, culture, and smear testing. A re-assessment of the tuberculosis burden is urgently needed in this setting as well as an assessment of the feasibility and value of non-sputum-based diagnostic tools to increase case detection and reduce ongoing transmission. Dr. Martinez proposes to: (1) measure the prevalence of undiagnosed TB and characteristics of tuberculosis among Brazilian prisoners who are unable to provide sputum samples at the baseline screening visit; (2) determine the feasibility and sensitivity of Mask Aerosol Sampling system (MASS), a novel tool that directly captures exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients, during a mass screening intervention; and (3) identify cost-effective algorithms for tuberculosis screening in prisons. The proposed project will leverage an NIH-funded R01 study (AI130058-01, PI, Andrews/Croda) by the primary mentors, which is ongoing and enrolls adults in several prisons located in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. This research plan forms the basis of a 5-year career development plan for Dr. Martinez under the mentorship of Drs. Jason Andrews (infectious diseases, epidemiology), Julie Parsonnet (adult infectious diseases), Julio Croda (infectious diseases, health policy), Yvonne Maldonado (pediatric infectious diseases), and Upinder Singh (infectious diseases) with consultants Robert Horsburgh (clinical epidemiology), Michael Barer (tuberculosis diagnostics), and Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert (cost-effectiveness analyses). This interdisciplinary group has developed a career development program for Dr. Martinez that includes: (1) fostering skills in designing field-based research and data collection; (2) application of statistical methods for the study of novel diagnostics; (3) effective usage of and experience with new advanced statistical methodologies related to decision-tree algorithmic creation, cost- effectiveness analysis, and mathematical modeling; (4) regular meetings with mentors and consultants; (5) presenting results at scientific meetings and seminars; (6) publishing in peer-reviewed journals; and (7) writing and submitting an R01 grant. Completion of this career development plan will allow Dr. Martinez to successfully compete for extramural funding in the future to continue researching non-sputum-based tuberculosis diagnostics in high-risk populations. Project Narrative. Increasing tuberculosis case detection, especially in high-risk groups, is critical to meet the World Health Organization’s End TB Strategy to reduce tuberculosis incidence by 90% globally by 2035. A significant barrier to achieving this goal is that a large proportion of patients are unable to produce sputum and are therefore are not evaluated with commonly used and recommended diagnostics such as GeneXpert, culture, and smear testing. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify and quantify the burden of undiagnosed tuberculosis in Brazilian prisoners, evaluate the feasibility and value of non-sputum-based diagnostics to improve case detection in this setting, and to identify cost-effective algorithms for tuberculosis screening in prisons.",Identifying effective and efficient approaches to tuberculosis screening in Brazilianprisons,10105242,K01AI156022,"['Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Algorithms', 'Brazil', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Contracts', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhalation', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health Policy', 'Imprisonment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Masks', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Natural History', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prisoner', 'Prisons', 'Program Development', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'case finding', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'point of care', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIAID,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K01,2021,128574
"Skeletal Myopathy in Systemic Sclerosis: Devising a Classification Schema Predictive of Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Skeletal myopathy in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is associated with increased disability and mortality. There is no consensus classification of SSc-associated myopathy that can be utilized to lay the groundwork for understanding muscle disease in scleroderma. We know that there is pathological, serological, and outcome heterogeneity that may be informative in defining distinct subsets of myopathy in SSc. Our preliminary data demonstrate that (1) muscle histopathology is heterogeneous in SSc, (2) patients with a fibrosing myopathy have poor outcomes, in particular cardiac death, and (3) there is intense signal uptake on advanced MRI imaging such as diffusion weighted and tensor imaging and T2 mapping in SSc-associated myopathy which may indicate early disease related changes when compared to conventional muscle MRI. This K23 proposal will first establish a Myopathy cohort (Aim 1), devise a classification schema and test its utility in predicting long term outcomes such as trajectory, cardiopulmonary disease, disability, mortality, and treatment responsiveness(Aim 2), and detect and quantify early disease related muscle changes on advanced muscle MRI (Aim 3). This application is for a K23 award for Julie Paik, MD, MHS, Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology at the Johns Hopkins University. Her long term career goal is to become a leading clinical investigator in scleroderma muscle disease in the context of observational cohort studies, state of the art imaging biomarkers, and clinical trial methodology. Her short term goal of devising this classification schema will provide a new gold standard for the validation of external myopathy cohorts in SSc and lay the framework for future studies directed at understanding biological mechanism and developing a therapeutic trial using measurable outcomes such as quantitative muscle MRI. This proposal takes advantage of the rich resources and infrastructure at the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center, a recently designated Precision Center of Excellence in 2018. Her mentoring team includes Dr. Laura Hummers and Dr. Fredrick Wigley, both renowned experts in SSc and clinical epidemiology, Dr. Andrew Mammen is an internationally recognized myositis expert, and Dr. Scott Zeger a leader in bio statistical and epidemiological research. Dr. Paik has recruited vital members to her Advisory Committee, composed of mentors and collaborators who have specific expertise relevant to the proposal and are fully supportive of Dr. Paik’s research and career goals. These include Dr. Michael Jacobs (advanced radiological imaging), Dr. Laura Fayad (musculoskeletal radiology), Dr. Andrea Corse (muscle histopathology), Dr. Tom Lloyd (classification schemas in inclusion body myositis), and Dr. Ami Shah (scleroderma translational research). This K23 award will allow Dr. Paik to gain the skills needed to analyze and develop a classification schema of skeletal myopathy in scleroderma, develop expertise in advanced muscle MRI analysis, and build her clinical trial skill set to ultimately support a future R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will establish a comprehensive, prospective myopathy cohort in systemic sclerosis (SSc or scleroderma) to ultimately devise a novel classification schema for SSc-associated myopathy that is predictive of outcomes such as treatment response, disability, cardiopulmonary disease trajectory, and death. Advanced muscle MRI techniques include diffusion weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and T2 mapping will also be used to detect and quantify early muscle disease related changes in SSc associated myopathy.

"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,10213601,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,186147
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,10136697,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood pressure variability', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,172800
"Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Candace Feldman is an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy and the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Dr. Feldman has a longstanding passion to understand and reduce disparities in rheumatic diseases. Her research focuses on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in prevalence, access and outcomes among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her 14 peer-reviewed original publications, 8 first author, and 2 early career development grants exemplify her track record and her commitment to this field. She holds a MPH degree and is pursuing a doctorate in social epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her immediate goals are to learn and apply advanced health services research and qualitative methods to understand SLE-related avoidable acute care use to inform a future intervention. She will be guided by Dr. Costenbader, an established SLE epidemiologist, and an expert mentoring team. Dr. Feldman strives to apply rigorous methods to redesign healthcare delivery for vulnerable rheumatology patients. Environment: Dr. Feldman’s Division Chief ensures that >75% of her time will be protected for research and career development for the 5-year duration of this K23 award. She has financial support to supplement her salary and project-related expenses from the Division, the SCS, and her primary mentor’s funding. The BWH Lupus Center, co-directed by Dr. Costenbader, is the largest in New England. The research infrastructure established as part of the Center will enable Dr. Feldman to recruit patients. In addition, the SCS has extensive research infrastructure, which will continue to support her work. Dr. Feldman has access to Medicaid data under Dr. Costenbader’s Data Use Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and to Partners HealthCare electronic health records linked to claims data through the explicit support of Population Health Management. For her training, she will have access to courses and mentorship at HSPH, where she is a doctoral student, and through Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Catalyst Program. Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care. There is a need to define and understand lupus-specific avoidable acute care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) and to identify those patients at highest risk. This study will inform the design of interventions aimed at optimizing outpatient care, preventing adverse outcomes, and reducing disparities among patients with complex, subspecialty-managed diseases.",Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus,10137787,K23AR071500,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Administrator', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delphi Technique', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Financial Support', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lupus', 'Mediating', 'Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Social support', 'Structural Models', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'instructor', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medical schools', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social epidemiology', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'therapy design']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,178195
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,10097958,K08AI125682,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malaria transmission', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parasite invasion', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'professor', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'surveillance data', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2021,185224

Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",10248297,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2021,121999

"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,10080366,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2021,161047
"Radiomics signatures and patient outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The following K23 proposal is for Dr. Sam Payabvash, a Neuroradiologist and Assistant Professor of Radiology at Yale University. Dr. Payabvash is a physician-scientist with specialized expertise at the intersection of neuroscience, neuroimaging, and computer vision. His career goal is to find new treatment targets and to provide personalized care for patients with cerebrovascular disease. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most devastating cerebrovascular diseases with no effective treatment. To date, imaging markers of ICH risk- stratification and outcome prediction have been subjective and descriptive in nature, leaving a large gap for automated assessment of imaging feautres embedded in medical images. Preliminary results by Dr. Payabvash have demonstrated the feasibility of a research plan to apply automated feature extraction pipelines and machine learning algorithms to harness the information in medical images for early risk-stratification and identification of potential treatment targets in ICH. In this proposal, Dr. Payabvash will use detailed clinical and imaging data of 3,991 patients from NIH-funded clinical trials, online archives, and institutional registries at Yale, Tufts, and University College of London. He will apply machine-learning algorithms to identify those imaging features of brain hemorrhage on baseline head CT scan that are related to symptom severity at presentation (aim 1). Then, he will use imaging features of hemorrhage to identify those patients who are at risk for early expansion of hematoma (aim 2a), or surrounding edema (aim 2b). These two “modifiable” indicators of poor outcome are considered potential treatment targets in ICH patients. Finally, he will combine admission clinical information and imaging features to build a risk-stratification tool for long-term outcome prediction (aim 3). Under the expert mentorship of Dr. Kevin Sheth (Chief of Neurocritical Care), Dr. Todd Constable (Director of MRI Research), and Dr. Ronald Coifman (Professor of Mathematics), this K23 award will allow Dr. Payabvash to (1) identify and address the most pressing issues in cerebrovascular disease with innovative neurogaming tools; (2) gain expertise in advanced statistical analysis of brain scans; and (3) expand his knowledge in machine learning and computer vision for assessment of medical images. Dr. Payabvash will receive didactic training in neuroimaging statistical analysis, machine learning, deep neural networks, and computer vision. The proposed research and career development plans draw on the wealth of resources available at Yale, including a Regional Coordinating Center for the NIH StrokeNet, the Center for Research Computing; High Performance Computing services, and cutting-edge image processing and analysis infrastructure. At the conclusion of this award period, Dr. Payabvash will be well-positioned to become an independently-funded investigator conducting high-quality research in advanced neuroimaging techniques and analysis aimed at improving the care of patients with cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severely debilitating cerebrovascular disease, which affects over 70,000 patients per year in the U.S., and is responsible for over half of stroke-related disability worldwide. So far, the diagnosis, surveillance, and prediction of outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage have mainly relied on visual and subjective assessment of head CT scans. Computerized assessment of medical images and machine learning algorithms can extract hidden features from CT scans and provide innovative tools for accurate outcome prediction and personalized treatment decisions in patients with hemorrhagic stroke.",Radiomics signatures and patient outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage,10301527,K23NS118056,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Brain scan', 'Caring', 'Cellularity', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Edema', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Healthcare', 'Hematoma', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Necrosis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Proteomics', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rogaine', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood-brain barrier disruption', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical risk', 'college', 'computerized', 'cytotoxic', 'data archive', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'feature extraction', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'functional independence', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'modifiable risk', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'online repository', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'research and development', 'risk stratification', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment optimization']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,194939
"Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Abstract Andrew Holbrook, Ph.D., is a Bayesian statistician with a broad background in applied, theoretical and compu- tational data science. His proposed research Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning tackles viral outbreak forecasting by combining Bayesian phylogenetic modeling with ﬂexible, `self-exciting' stochastic process models. The development and publication of open-source, high-performance computing software for his models will facilitate fast epidemiological ﬁeld response in a big data setting. Dr. Holbrook will apply his method- ology to the reconstruction of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic in the Americas, focusing on identifying key geographical routes of transmission and phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.  Candidate: Dr. Holbrook is Postdoctoral Scholar at the UCLA Department of Human Genetics. He earned his Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine, during which time he completed his dissertation Geometric Bayes, an investigation into Bayesian modeling and computing on abstract mathematical spaces, and simultaneously participated in scientiﬁc collaborations at the UC Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The proposed career development plan will establish Dr. Holbrook as an independent leader in data intensive viral epidemiology by 1) facilitating coursework to build biological domain knowledge, 2) affording Dr. Holbrook the opportunity to lead his own project while remaining under the expert oversight of UCLA Prof. Marc Suchard, M.D., Ph.D., and 3) allowing Dr. Holbrook to continue his focus on quantitative viral epidemiology once he has moved to a faculty commitment.  Mentors: During the ﬁrst three years of the award period, Dr. Holbrook will work closely with Prof. Suchard, continuing their current schedule of weekly meetings. Prof. Suchard is a leading expert in both Bayesian phylo- genetics and high-performance statistical computing; and with his medical background, Prof. Suchard will advise Dr. Holbrook in his expansion of domain knowledge in viral epidemiology. As secondary mentor, Prof. Kristian Andersen, Ph.D., of the Scripps Institute will advise Dr. Holbrook in the impactful application of his statistical and computational methodologies to the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic. Dr. Holbrook and Profs. Suchard and Andersen will maintain their collaborations after the postdoctoral period.  Research: Bayesian phylogenetics successfully reconstructs evolutionary histories but fails to predict viral spread. Self-exciting point processes are devoid of biological insight and fail to account for geographic networks of diffusion. Aim 1 addresses deﬁciencies in these two complementary viral epidemiological modeling techniques by innovating a combined model where the phylogenetic and self-excitatory components support each other. Aim 2 makes widespread adoption a reality by publishing open-source, massively parallel computing software suitable for big data analysis. Aim 3 reconstructs the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic, learns key geographical routes of transmission and identiﬁes phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness. Project Narrative Tracking and predicting viral outbreaks remains an open epidemiological problem with deadly consequences. Dr. Holbrook will attack the problem with his Bayesian phylogenetic Hawkes processes, a class of models tailored to simultaneously reconstruct evolutionary histories and predict viral diffusion dynamics. With the mentorship of Profs. Marc Suchard (primary) and Kristian Andersen (secondary), Dr. Holbrook will develop open-source, high-performance computing software and apply his statistical computing methodology to the analysis of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic of the Americas, learning key routes of transmission and identifying phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.",Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning,10176406,K25AI153816,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Air', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Americas', 'Award', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Herd Immunity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Ships', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Viral', 'Viral Epidemiology', 'Viral Physiology', 'Work', 'ZIKA', 'Zika Virus', 'blind', 'career development', 'epidemiological model', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'outbreak prediction', 'parallel computer', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'statistics', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K25,2021,106467
"Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy Abstract: This project aims to establish differential artery-vein analysis in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and to validate comprehensive OCTA features for automated classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Early detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of treatment outcomes are essential to prevent irreversible visual loss from DR. It is known that DR can target arteries and veins differently. Therefore, differential artery-vein analysis can provide better performance of DR detection and classification. However, clinical OCTA instruments lack the capability of artery-vein differentiation. During this project, we propose to use quantitative feature analysis of OCT, which is concurrently captured with OCTA, to guide artery- vein differentiation in OCTA. The first aim is to establish automated artery-vein differentiation in OCTA. In coordination with our recently demonstrated blood vessel tracking technique, OCT intensity/geometry features will be used to guide artery-vein differentiation in OCTA automatically. Differential artery-vein analysis of blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vessel caliber (BVC), blood vessel density (BVD), vessel perimeter index (VPI), vessel branching coefficient (VBC), vessel branching angle (VBA), branching width ratio (BWR), fovea avascular zone area (FAZ-A) and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) will be implemented. Key success criterion of the aim 1 study is to demonstrate robust artery-vein differentiation in OCTA, and to establish OCTA features for objective detection and classification of DR. The second aim is to validate automated OCTA classification of DR. We propose to employ ensemble machine learning to integrate multiple classifiers to achieve robust OCTA classification of DR. Key success criterion of the aim 2 study is to identify OCTA features and optimal-feature- combination to detect early DR, and to establish the correlations between the OCTA features and clinical biomarkers. The third aim is to verify OCTA prediction and evaluation of DR treatment. Our preliminary OCTA study of diabetic macular edema (DME) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment has shown that BVD can serve as a biomarker predictive of visual improvement. During this project, we plan to test differential artery-vein analysis for DME treatment evaluation. Key success criterion of the aim 3 study is to identify artery-vein features to provide robust prediction and evaluation of DME treatment outcomes. As an alternative approach, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for deep machine leaning based artery-vein and DR classification. Early layers in the FCNN will produce simple features, which will be convolved and filtered into deeper layers to produce complex features for artery-vein and DR classification. Further investigation of the relationship between the new features learned through the machine learning process and clinical biomarkers will allow us to optimize the design for better DR classification. Success of this project will pave the way towards using quantitative OCTA features for early DR detection, objective prediction and assessment of treatment outcomes. Project Narrative This project is to establish quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). By translating subjective findings into objective assessments, this study will standardize clinical OCTA for eye disease detection and treatment assessment.

Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,10137788,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'structured data', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2021,176541
"Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors PROJECT SUMMARY: Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Lili Chan's career development into an independently funded clinical investigator leveraging electronic health records (EHR) and improve risk prediction of adverse outcomes in patients on hemodialysis (HD) by incorporating social determinants of health. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Chan has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring and advisory team lead by Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of Clinical Research in Nephrology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and co-mentor Dr. Peter Kotanko, Adjunct Professor of Medicine at Mount Sinai and Research Director of the Renal Research Institute. Her advisory team consists of Dr. Weng, an expert and in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP), Dr. Alex Federman, who has contributed significantly to the literature on the effects of psychosocial factors on patient care, and Dr. Mazumdar, an expert in biostatistics and risk prediction modeling. Dr. Chan's proposed training plan focuses on four areas, (1) advanced statistical methodology; (2) bioinformatics; (3) patient centered outcomes; and (4) career development. Environment: The Icahn school of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research. Specifically the Division of Nephrology has over 30 funded investigators and has successfully mentored five faculty members from K awards to R01 awards. Research: Given the high morbidity and mortality of HD patients, there is a critical need for better risk stratification and identification of high risk groups in order for targeted interventions to be tested. This project utilizes prospectively collected surveys and retrospective chart review of a cohort of diverse patients on chronic HD who receive care from four Renal Research Institute and six Mount Sinai Health System hemodialysis units located throughout New York City. The Specific Aims of the research are: (1) to determine the association between domains of social determinants of health and hospitalizations using survey research methods; (2) to identify social determinants of health in an accurate manner using natural processing language; and (3) to create risk prediction models for hospitalization among patients on HD utilizing both standard measures and social determinants of health using standard statistical methods and machine learning. This research leverages novel computational methods to examine the association of social determinants of health and hospitalizations in HD patients and incorporates SDOH into risk prediction models which will allow for identification of high risk HD patients for inclusion in future intervention trials. The results of this proposal sets the foundation for future R01 studies validating these findings in external data sets and testing the utility of EHR integrated clinical decision tools on reducing hospitalizations, readmissions, and mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patients on hemodialysis have high rates of hospitalizations. Yet, social determinants of health (economic instability, education, neighborhood and built environment, social and community context, and health and healthcare access), which have previously been demonstrated to be associated with hospitalization in hemodialysis patients, are not easily identified and used in research. We plan to identify these factors using prospective surveys and natural language processing software on electronic health records, where these factors are routinely documented, and add these factors to standard clinical factors in complex machine learning models to identify patients at higher risk for hospitalization, and in the process train Dr. Lili Chan into an independent clinical investigator in the field of “big data” research in nephrology.",Improving risk prediction of adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients by incorporating non-traditional risk factors,10127066,K23DK124645,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Coca', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrology', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self Care', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum Albumin', 'Social Identification', 'Social support', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Treatment/Psychosocial Effects', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'built environment', 'career development', 'cohort', 'data standards', 'discrete data', 'electronic structure', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'professor', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'social relationships', 'standard measure', 'tool']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K23,2021,191778
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,10164748,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data repository', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'substance use treatment', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2021,203040
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,10219347,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2021,118570
"Novel imaging genetic biomarkers for sporadic frontotemporal dementia through machine learning Project Summary This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Iris Broce-Diaz, a neuroimaging genetics postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Diego and University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Broce-Diaz is establishing herself as a young imaging geneticist conducting clinical research on neurodegenerative disease. This K01 will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) gain proficiency in machine learning and computational modeling techniques, (2) gain proficiency in clinical and genetic research methodology for cognitive aging and complex spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including clinical characterization of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias, differential diagnosis, risk prediction, and biomarker development, and (3) develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Broce-Diaz has assembled an expert mentoring team, including her primary mentors: Dr Anders Dale (renowned computational neuroimaging genetics scientist) and co-primary mentor Bruce Miller (internationally recognized behavioral neurologist and leader in FTD), co-mentors: Drs. Jennifer Yokoyama (expert in FTD genetics) and Chun Chieh Fan (expert in epidemiology/biostatistics), and two collaborators: Drs. Adam Boxer (leader in clinical trials for FTD-spectrum disorders) and Wesley Thompson (expert in advanced statistics). The goal of the proposed project is to develop novel imaging genetics biomarkers for predicting individuals at risk of developing sporadic (non-familial) FTD and improving classification accuracy of sporadic FTD. Dr. Broce- Diaz will achieve this goal through the following specific aims: (1a) utilize a polygenic hazard approach to develop and validate a novel genetic biomarker for predicting age-specific risk of sporadic FTD; (1b) leverage pleiotropic information to increase accuracy of the genetic risk scores and derive biologically-based genetic risk scores; (2) use machine learning approaches to reliably and accurately classify FTD clinical subtypes and obtain personalized atrophy scores from these brain maps; and (3) improve FTD classification by integrating atrophy scores with genetic risk scores. This proposed study uses highly innovative methodological approaches for informing FTD prognosis, diagnosis, and, ultimately, clinical trial design. If validated, these biomarkers will make significant contributions by assisting clinicians in identifying patients at elevated risk for sporadic FTD and assisting in diagnosing sporadic FTD in its earliest stages—reducing diagnostic delays, accelerating the discovery of novel treatments, and improving recruitment accuracy in clinical trials. This K01 research project will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the protected research time and opportunity to train with leaders in the field she needs to master the skills required to establish an independent, patient-oriented, imaging genetics and biomarker development clinical research program that will inform diagnosis, prognosis, and guide treatments of FTD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Narrative The development and validation of predictive models is a critical step toward improving strategies for an early diagnosis of sporadic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other neurodegenerative diseases and improving strategies for personalized treatment. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel imaging genetic biomarkers that can help clinicians with an early and accurate diagnosis and prognosis of sporadic FTD.

"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression. Developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. The proposed work will identify disease phenotypes in knee OA that will allow for the assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effect in clinical trials and ultimately lead to the development of targeted interventions and therapies.",Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression,10208726,K01AR075879,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Arthralgia', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cartilage', 'Catabolism', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatology', 'Right to Treatments', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Virginia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'aging population', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bone', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'complex data', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,130950
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,10086491,K23HL135274,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Self Administration', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'behavior change', 'big biomedical data', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'digital', 'digital medicine', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preempt', 'prevent', 'professor', 'risk prediction', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,203678
"Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for a Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) from Dr. Lorenzo Pasquini, a postdoctoral scholar in clinical neuroimaging at the Memory and Aging Center (MAC), University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Pasquini is an early-career neuroscientist investigating the neural systems underlying socioemotional symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Pasquini has a strong background in neuroscience, clinical neuroimaging, and machine-learning techniques, but he requires mentored research and high-level training in four different areas to become established as an independent investigator. The training and research program outlined in this proposal will provide Dr. Pasquini with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: 1) gain extended expertize in the clinical manifestation of socioemotional symptoms among elderly populations; 2) achieve proficiency in analysis of multimodal dynamic systems through the application of cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms; 3) get proficiency in the analysis of autonomic physiological recordings; and 4) develop an independent research career niche based on scientific productivity and grant applications. To achieve these goals, Dr. Pasquini has assembled a mentorship team including a primary mentor, Dr. William Seeley, a behavioral neurologist with deep expertize in neuroanatomy and neuroimaging of neurodegenerative diseases; a co-mentor, Dr. Virginia Sturm, a clinical psychologist who investigates autonomic and socioemotional deficits across distinct dementia syndromes; a second co-mentor, Dr. Manish Saggar, a computational neuroscientist developing computational methods to map dynamic brain activity in healthy and psychiatric populations; and a significant contributor, Dr. Isabel Allen, a statistician expert in machine-learning. This proposal describes the application of innovative techniques that aim to elucidate how the autonomic system and the brain dynamically interact to shape emotions and social behavior in healthy controls and patients with neurodegenerative syndromes. By leveraging the neuroanatomical and autonomic deficits found in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Dr. Pasquini seeks to identify the fundamental properties of neural systems underlying socioemotional well-being, with important implications for psychiatry where the neurobiology underlying affective disorders is not well understood. Dr. Pasquini will first delineate deficits in dynamic brain network organization in patients with bvFTD and explore the relationship to socioemotional symptoms (Aim 1). Dr. Pasquini will proceed by identifying deficits in dynamic autonomic outflow in patients with bvFTD and assess the neural correlates through separately acquired neuroimaging (Aim 2). Finally, Dr. Pasquini will capitalize on multimodal simultaneous acquisitions of autonomic outflow and brain network imaging acquired in healthy older controls to explore how both systems dynamically interact to sustain human emotions and social behavior (Exploratory Aim 3). The proposed training will allow Dr. Pasquini to develop a scientific niche and conduct his research with world-class mentorship, paving the way for his career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The neurobiological basis of socioemotional symptoms, a debilitating feature of many neurological and psychiatric disorders, is not well understood. The brain and autonomic nervous system cohesively interact to support socioemotional well-being, and cutting-edge analytical techniques can now reveal the rich dynamic properties of these systems. By leveraging behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disease of socioemotional deficits that targets these systems, the goal of the proposed project is to determine how autonomic and functional brain network dynamics shape human emotions and social behavior in healthy and clinical populations.",Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function,10227218,K99AG065457,"['Affective Symptoms', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Breathing', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Status', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'career', 'cohesion', 'dynamic system', 'fundamental research', 'geriatric neuropsychiatry', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2021,125010
"Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy This K24 grant will provide the PI, Dr. Lin Yee Chen, a midcareer NIH-funded patient-oriented research (POR) investigator, with the protected time and support needed to (1) accelerate his current trajectory in mentoring junior clinicians and investigators who are conducting POR in cardiovascular (CV) science, (2) acquire additional training in mentoring methods, machine learning, and omics science, (3) promote his current research that aims to define the mechanisms underlying the relationship of the abnormal atrial substrate—atrial cardiomyopathy—and atrial fibrillation (AF) to ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes. Trainees in his AF Clinical Research Group will be recruited from the NIH-funded T32 training programs in the University of Minnesota's Division of Cardiology, Division of Epidemiology, and Division of Biostatistics; Department of Medicine Physician Scientist Training Program; KL2 and TL1 Programs of the CTSI; and graduate programs (MS in Clinical Research, MPH, and PhD) in the School of Public Health. For his career development, Dr. Chen will hone his mentoring skills and learn new skills in cutting-edge areas (machine learning and omics science) through focused study, selected coursework, seminars, and guidance from senior collaborators with domain expertise. Finally, this grant will support a research project that is based on the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, which extends Dr. Chen’s ongoing work to elucidate the role of atrial cardiomyopathy in driving AF-related outcomes. The specific aims are: (1) Identify atrial cardiomyopathy subtypes by using machine learning approaches to analyze the extensive data at ARIC Visit 5 (2011-13): clinical, 2D-echocardiographic, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, ECG, and multi-omics data, (2) Evaluate association of subtypes with ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes, and (3) Discover specific risk factors for subtypes by analyzing risk factor measures collected at Visits 1-4 (1987-98). Crucially, findings will be validated in 2 independent community-based cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). This project has significant impact: (1) This K24 grant will provide the PI with the protected time to enhance his current mentoring of trainees involved in POR. By assembling a team of senior collaborators that comprise experts in mentoring, data science, and molecular epidemiology, the PI provides an outstanding platform for his mentees to acquire cutting-edge skills in POR, (2) By resolving heterogeneity in atrial cardiomyopathy, the team will advance the NIH’s Precision Medicine initiative by personalizing current treatment for patients based on biological underpinnings, (3) The findings will lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in classification of stroke risk in patients with AF, which will improve patient outcomes, (4) By efficiently leveraging existing resources of deeply phenotyped NHLBI cohorts, this project will fill critical knowledge gaps in prevention and treatment, thus achieving a sustained and powerful impact on CV public health, clinical practice, and education of the next generation of researchers in POR. The abnormal atrial substrate (atrial cardiomyopathy) is associated with elevated risks of ischemic stroke dementia, and other cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure. Progress in preventing these adverse outcomes has been hampered by unresolved heterogeneity underlying atrial cardiomyopathy; hence, this K24 grant will support a project that will use machine learning and dense phenotypic data to identify clinically relevant subtypes of atrial cardiomyopathy. Additionally, this K24 grant will foster a supportive environment for the mentoring of junior investigators involved in patient-oriented research and facilitate acquisition of new cutting-edge skills by the PI and his mentees.",Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy,10307378,K24HL155813,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Atrial Function', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'aptamer', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'exome', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rate variability', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'patient oriented research', 'phenotypic data', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'stroke risk', 'supportive environment', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,K24,2021,126631
"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment with ECT, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more efficient use of ECT, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with refractory illness. Simultaneously, this proposal will develop the career of the Principal Investigator, Miklos Argyelan, M.D., as an independent translational researcher.",Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia,10119330,K23MH120504,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Chronic Schizophrenia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electrodes', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Principal Investigator', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Work', 'base', 'bioelectricity', 'biomarker identification', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'electric field', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'psychotic symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'translational scientist', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,FEINSTEIN INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,K23,2021,195480
"Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT Project Summary  In some individuals chronic tobacco smoke exposure results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Both of these parenchymal changes are irreversible, highlighting the importance of the early identification of their development and progression. Unfortunately, currently available methods for detecting the presence and evolution of these changes have limited sensitivity and specificity for very early disease and for subtle disease progression. Dr. Ash’s work has shown that automated objective analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest can detect clinically relevant radiologic findings called interstitial changes that may represent early pulmonary fibrosis, even in individuals without visually apparent disease. In the first aim of this proposal, Dr. Ash will refine and utilize a more sensitive and specific automated CT analysis tool that he and his lab have developed for the detection of both emphysema and interstitial changes. He will determine if emphysema and interstitial changes detected using this method are clinically significant in those patients deemed normal by previously performed visual analysis and in those deemed normal by other objective approaches. In the second aim, he will determine if areas of locally high density tissue in visually normal appearing lung parenchyma measured using augmented versions of his objective analysis tools are associated with mortality, other clinical outcomes, and peripheral measures of inflammation. Finally, in the third aim he will utilize these techniques to analyze longitudinal CT scans from the COPDGene study that were obtained over 10 years of follow-up, and will identify factors that predict or modify the development and progression of parenchymal changes on CT.  Dr. Ash will perform this work in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, under the mentorship of Dr. George Washko, an expert in the field of medical image analysis and the co-principal investigator of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at BWH. With the guidance of Dr. Washko and his scientific advisory committee, Dr. Ash has developed a comprehensive five year training program to develop the skills needed to become an independent investigator with expertise in quantitative image analysis, including predictive modeling and statistical machine learning.  Dr. Ash is dedicated to a career in academic medicine. His goal is to become a clinician-scientist using the skills gained during this award to improve our ability to detect and monitor smoking related lung disease. The techniques he has proposed may help identify modifiable risk factors and treatments for smoking related lung disease, determine which patients are likely to benefit from treatment, and monitor the response to therapy. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, but only in a minority of smokers. This proposal aims to use advanced objective analysis of chest computed tomography images to detect the earliest manifestations of smoking related lung disease. This will enable us to identify susceptible patients at the earliest possible moment, track their disease progression, and ultimately shift treatment strategies from palliating disease related symptoms to preventing disease development.",Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT,10079021,K08HL145118,"['Advisory Committees', 'Area', 'Award', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Densitometry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Evolution', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predictive Factor', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chest computed tomography', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'exercise capacity', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interstitial', 'lung injury', 'mange', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'palliate', 'palliating symptoms', 'palliation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protein biomarkers', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoking-related lung disease', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,170320
"Advanced Training at the Interface of Engineering and Oral-Craniofacial Sciences Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Oral diseases and disorders in the craniofacial complex disproportionally and devastatingly afflict susceptible populations, particularly impoverished families and medically or physically compromised persons. Novel engineering approaches, properly leveraged, can yield new paradigms to reveal disease mechanism, new strategies for disease mitigation, and new approaches for affordable/personalized therapies for dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and needs; all must be aware of the complex clinical and regulatory landscapes. To address this urgent need, we propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician. Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1) engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees, tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3) principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program, unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Advances in engineering approaches offer previously unimagined opportunities to advance the NIDCR 2030 vision of precision oral health for all. To harness this opportunity, a critical mass of cross-trained dentists and engineers engaged in oral and craniofacial research are urgently needed. We will develop this workforce.

"Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis PROJECT SUMMARY This overall goal of this mentored patient-oriented research career development award is to improve our understanding of pouchitis and other inflammatory conditions after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Dr. Barnes is a motivated clinical researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), with a specific interest in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases. Over the next five years, Dr. Barnes will work with his mentorship committee to continue his progression towards his goal of independence. His mentorship committee includes experts in gastrointestinal epidemiology and comparative effectiveness (Kappelman), patient reported outcomes [(PROs) DeWalt], and precision medicine (Kosorok). Each member has an established track record of mentoring junior faculty, consistent peer-reviewed support, and high research productivity. Dr. Barnes’s career development objectives are as follows: 1) develop a new skillset in comparative effectiveness research using real-world data; 2) obtain knowledge and experience in the development of PRO assessments; 3) acquire new skills in machine learning and precision medicine principles which will allow for the incorporation of clinical and microbiota data into new risk modeling for patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA, and 4) transition to independence. To achieve his career development objectives, Dr. Barnes will participate in structured coursework, conduct mentored research, and will participate in workshops through the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, including the R-Writing Group. The research and training environment at UNC is well established. For fiscal year 2019, UNC ranked tenth among both private and public universities nationwide for National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding to domestic institutions of higher education. The specific aims of this research project are 1) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of specific biologic therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions of the pouch after IPAA; 2) to develop PRO items for evaluating quality of life and specific symptom domains among patients after IPAA. Techniques for PRO development will include identifying symptom domains relevant to patients after IPAA using qualitative research methods, selecting candidate items for IPAA-specific PROs using existing PRO instruments where appropriate, and performing cognitive interviews with patients after IPAA to ensure content validity; and 3) to demonstrate novel methods for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis using a machine learning approach. Expanding an existing prospective cohort, Dr. Barnes will utilize the stool microbiome, laboratory data and clinical variables to create signatures for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis. The combination of mentorship, didactics, and research experiences offered through this K23 proposal will allow Dr. Barnes to develop a unique skillset that will aid in his ultimate transition to independence as a clinical investigator and research scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the most common surgery for refractory ulcerative colitis and ulcerative colitis-related dysplasia, multiple complications can occur. Short and long-term complications include inflammatory conditions of the pouch such as acute and chronic pouchitis and Crohn’s-like disease of the pouch, each of which can require new medical treatments after surgery and can significantly impact the quality of life of individual patients. This mentored patient-oriented research career development project will generate evidence about the comparative effectiveness of therapies for the treatment of these inflammatory conditions of the pouch, will develop new IPAA-specific patient-reported assessments of pouch symptoms and quality of life, and will utilize precision medicine techniques including machine learning to identify patients at high-risk for developing chronic pouchitis.",Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis,10103883,K23DK127157,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colectomy', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Counseling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Crowding', 'Curative Surgery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysplasia', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Ileal Reservoirs', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pouchitis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privatization', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Restorative Proctocolectomy', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cognitive interview', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'effectiveness study', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'higher education', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented research', 'precision medicine', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K23,2021,200052
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,10164762,K23DK117061,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Asia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duodenum', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gluten', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Pathology', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lactulose', 'Lamina Propria', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocytosis', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Small Intestines', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Villous Atrophy', 'Virginia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'dietary', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'enteric pathogen', 'epithelium regeneration', 'imaging approach', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrition', 'oral vaccine', 'patient oriented', 'socioeconomics', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tissue injury', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K23,2021,192552
"Mentoring in patient-oriented atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular research PROJECT SUMMARY This application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Alvaro Alonso, with protected time and other support to (1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior clinical investigators and graduate students engaged in patient-oriented cardiovascular research; (2) obtain additional training in omics, machine learning, and mentoring best-practices; and (3) advance Dr. Alonso's ongoing research on the risk factors and mechanisms contributing to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Mentoring activities will build upon the ongoing involvement of Dr. Alonso in several training programs at Emory University, including an NHLBI-funded multidisciplinary T32 training grant on cardiovascular health disparities, the research-track Cardiology fellowship program at the School of Medicine, and the Master of Public Health and PhD programs in epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health. Training will focus on cutting-edge methodological areas in rapid development, including integration of omic technologies and machine learning in patient-oriented research, as well as acquisition of skills in academic, research, and clinical mentoring. Finally, this award will support a research project that extends Dr. Alonso's ongoing work on understanding the factors influencing the development of the AF substrate, understanding AF pathophysiology, and preventing AF-related outcomes. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to identify novel AF phenotypes (phenogroups) using extensive clinical and multi-omic data (“phenomapping”), (2) to discover specific risk factors for the different AF phenogroups, and (3) to determine associations of AF phenogroups with selected endpoints (stroke, heart failure, mortality). These research aims will be carried out in the context of the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, an ongoing prospective registry of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in three Emory-affiliated hospitals currently including approximately 7,000 unique individuals with detailed phenotyping, clinical outcomes, and multi-omic markers. In summary, the activities proposed in this application will favorably impact Dr. Alonso's capabilities to conduct cutting-edge and innovative patient-oriented research on cardiovascular prevention and his ability to perform as a highly qualified mentor for junior clinicians pursuing research on clinical cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite progress, atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia, remains a major public health program. This award will contribute to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of atrial fibrillation. In addition, it will support a nurturing environment for the mentoring of junior clinical investigators interested in prevention and treatment of atrial fibrillation and other cardiovascular diseases.",Mentoring in patient-oriented atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular research,10179458,K24HL148521,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Management', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Fellowship Program', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Stratification', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'candidate selection', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular health', 'career development', 'graduate student', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lifestyle factors', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient registry', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'sociodemographic factors', 'sociodemographics', 'transcriptomics', 'trend']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K24,2021,118502
