"BRAIN Initiative: Assessing development of event-related cortical network dynamics Project Summary The Child Mind Institute’s Healthy Brain Network (HBN) is an ongoing initiative focused on creating and sharing a biobank of brain and behavioral data now being collected from 10,000 New York City area children and adolescents (ages 5-21). In response to RFA-MH-120-20 (‘Integration and analysis of BRAIN Initiative data’), we will collect their high-density EEG and continuous eye tracking data, recorded from now over 3,000 young participants while they watch movies and rest, plus participant MR head images, to create a developmental EEG and eye tracking data and analysis resource within the BRAIN Initiative-funded NEMAR portal (NEMAR.org) to the OpenNeuro human neuroimaging resource (OpenNeuro.org). We will store the data in accord with the latest advances in the Brain Imaging Data Standard (BIDS), including innovative co-registration of eye-tracking information and EEG, extraction of anonymized Leadfield matrices for advanced participant-based source localization, and Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) annotation of movie and eye tracking events in the data, to enable sophisticated exploratory and model-based analyses by any user of the Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), which offers processing of complex tasks on the U.S. XSEDE computer network (XSEDE.org) for users of standard neuroscience software. We propose to build on the large existing and readily extensible set of tools for analysis, modeling, and visualization of human EEG data in the world leading EEGLAB software environment for electrophysiological signal processing we develop and maintain (5R01-NS047293-15) (sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab), to process the large corpus of innovative EEG and synchronous eye tracking data recorded during movie viewing by the HBN project. We will then apply source-resolved event-related analysis models to cortical EEG network dynamics associated with movie watching, will model their changes across development, and will compare the time course of these changes with changes in eye gaze patterns at the same age levels. We will use cortical source-resolved, event-related functional EEG connectivity measures implemented in the Source Information Flow Toolbox (SIFT) to model event-related EEG dynamics of individual participants, and will apply advanced hierarchical Bayes-based methods and statistical assessment to perform statistical testing on subject group models. We will study the development of event-related cortical information flow during movie watching and rest across the large HBN developmental (5-21 years) sample, and compare it to the developmental trajectory of changes in eye gaze patterns during movie viewing.

"The Neuroscience of Everyday World- A novel wearable system for continuous measurement of brain function Innovations in human neuroimaging tools have driven profound advances in our understanding of brain function under well-controlled and constrained conditions. While we are gaining greater understanding of how the brain functions in single-snapshot experiments under restricted lab settings, we do not know how it works in dynamic, complex and multisensory real-world environments. The goal of this project is to build a portable, miniaturized, lightweight, high-density wearable combined – functional Near Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) – Electro-Encepholography (EEG) - Eye-tracking system for enabling “Neuroscience of the Everyday World (NEW)” by permitting long duration continuous monitoring of normal / altered brain activity during movement, perception, and social interaction in real time and in the real world. In Aim 1, We will (A) develop a wearable and fully hybrid high-density EEG-fNIRS system that supports autonomous long-term recordings (>6 hours), (B) develop combined and miniaturized active EEG-Electrodes / fNIRS-Optodes; and (C) integrate the wearable system with Tobii Pro 2 eye-tracking/scene-camera glasses and state- of-the-art computer vision for adaptive acquisition and automated data annotation. In Aim 2, we will measure brain activity during walking, perceiving, and interacting, with experiments gradually increasing in complexity through three phases from lab to real world settings in young healthy adults and conduct a proof of principle in two sample clinical populations. In Aim 3, we will create an analysis workflow for data collected in Aim 2 that will accomplish the following: (1) removing nuisance signals from fNIRS/EEG signals, (2) analysis of multimodal fNIRS/EEG and behavioral data, (3) automatic annotation of and adaptation for real world measurements. This project brings together engineers, scientists and clinicians with the goal of building the next generation of imaging tools to capture brain function in real time. With our technological sophistication, interdisciplinary focus, and ready access to well-characterized clinical populations, we are uniquely positioned to successfully develop, apply, and disseminate our NEW technology, and lay down a foundation upon which groundbreaking advances in our understanding of the links between brain activity and behavior will build. There is a need to link brain activity to human movement, perception and cognition, and social communication in real time, and in the Everyday World. This project aims to develop a multi- modal wearable functional neuroimaging device to study brain function in freely behaving healthy subjects and to track the breakdown of normal brain function potentially revealing brain patterns that are signatures of these conditions.",The Neuroscience of Everyday World- A novel wearable system for continuous measurement of brain function,10263915,U01EB029856,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Walking', 'Work', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'hemodynamics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light weight', 'millisecond', 'miniaturize', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurofeedback', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'signal processing', 'social communication', 'tool', 'visual tracking', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),U01,2021,1000000
"Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets Project Summary During the past three decades non-invasive functional brain imaging has developed immensely in terms of measurement technologies, analysis methods, and innovative paradigms to capture information about brain function both in healthy and diseased individuals. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has become very useful, it only provides indirect information about neuronal activity through the neurovascular coupling with a limited temporal resolution. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) remain the only available noninvasive techniques capable of directly measuring the electrophysiological activity with a millisecond resolution. During the past eight years we have developed, with NIH support, the MNE-Python software, which covers multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. To further extend our software to meet the needs of a growing user base and reflect recent developments in the MEG/EEG field we will pursue three specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will: (i) Create an all-embracing suite of noise cancellation tools incorporating and extending methods present in different MEG systems; (ii) Implement device independent methods for head-movement determination and compensation on the basis of head movement data recorded during a MEG session; (iii) Develop methods for automatic tagging of artifacts using machine learning approaches. In Aim 2 our focus is to extend the software to make modern distributed computing resources easily usable in processing and to allow for remote visualization without the need to move large amounts of data across the network. Finally, in Aim 3, we will continue to develop MNE-Python using best programming practices ensuring multiplatform compatibility, extensive web-based documentation, training and forums, and hands-on training workshops. As a result of these developments the MNE-Python will be able to effectively process large number of subjects and huge amounts data ensuing and from multi-site studies harmoniously across different MEG/EEG systems. Narrative MEG and EEG can be used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language. However, widespread use of these methods especially in large populations has been problematic because of the lack of well-established analysis approaches, which map the sensor data into the brain space for detailed temporal, spatial, and connectivity analysis. This research will provide well-documented and tested novel analysis software to promote both basic neuroscience and clinical research applications using MEG and EEG.",Scalable Software for Distributed Processing and Visualization of Multi-Site MEG/EEG Datasets,10175064,R01NS104585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Educational workshop', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Experimental Designs', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Language Development', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data exchange', 'falls', 'human data', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'millisecond', 'multithreading', 'neurovascular coupling', 'novel', 'open source', 'pedagogy', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'software development', 'source localization', 'symposium', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,543993
"Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants. Project Summary Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) has revealed two major principles of the functional organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in human adults. First, some regions of VTC respond selectively to a specific category of stimuli, such as the fusiform face area (FFA) which responds more to faces than to any other stimulus category. The second principle of organization is that different categories of stimuli have systematically distinct patterns of response across the entire VTC. How do these two key aspects of VTC functional organization in adults arise in development? The goal of my research program is to discover if these organizing principles are present in the infant brain (Aims 1 and 2) and design computational models to test different theories of cortical development (Aim 3). The dissertation work in this proposal will provide invaluable data toward the goal of refining theories of cortical development. In addition to innovations that enhance the quality of awake infant fMRI data, Aim 1 provides the first evidence that like adults, infants have face-selective responses in the FFA, scene-selective responses in the parahippocampal place area (PPA), and body-selective responses in the extrastriate body area (EBA). Aim 2 directly follows this up by asking if infants have systematically distinct patterns of response across higher- level visual areas that are similar to those found in the adult brain. The F99 phase of this proposal will provide training to optimize machine learning (ML) techniques that can withstand the unique challenges of infant fMRI data – specifically unbalanced and missing data. The F99 phase will be conducted at MIT, an intellectual environment with access to leaders in the fields of ML, cognitive neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Finally, Aim 3 of this proposal is to build computational models designed to test current theories of cortical development. The K00 phase of this proposal will provide training on the design and implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) models as well as training on the best methods to test ANN models using infant fMRI data. Research for the K00 phase will provide a new mentorship experience with an established investigator in computational neuroscience and will take place at an institution with a thriving intellectual environment that has access to an MRI scanner and the computational resources necessary to build a variety of ANN models. In summary, the objective of the proposed research is to determine if the principles of functional organization in the adult brain are present in infants. Insights from this proposal will advance and refine theories of cortical development and have the potential to be applicable to other domains such audition and language. Further, by combining my predoctoral training in awake infant fMRI with my proposed postdoctoral training in computational modeling, the proposed research will enable me to become an independent investigator and leader in the field of computational developmental neuroscience. Project Narrative The last 20 years of cognitive neuroscience has revealed the functional architecture of the human brain with an exquisite degree of detail yet has left wide-open the question of what guides the precise development, organization, and structure of the human mind. This proposal outlines a plan to unify developmental cognitive neuroscience and computational cognitive neuroscience to uncover the starting state of the human visual system and how it develops. The proposed research stands to not only inform and refine theories of cortical development and inform our understanding of neurodevelopmental differences, but also has the potential to begin to unravel one of the most intriguing questions available to humanity: what are the origins of the human mind?",Function of high-level visual cortex in awake infants.,10319402,F99NS124175,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Social Desirability', 'Social support', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'awake', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computing resources', 'design', 'experience', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'fusiform face area', 'improved', 'inattention', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning community', 'model design', 'object recognition', 'organizational structure', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'response', 'social cognition', 'social engagement', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'tool', 'vision development']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F99,2021,47036
"Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface Project Summary: The long-term goal of this research is to develop a new, non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that will provide augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) capabilities to patients who have lost these capabilities due to severe motor impairments, such as completely locked-in syndrome (CLIS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and severe cerebral palsy (CP). The proposed research project will work towards a long-term goal by developing a BCI based on brain imaging signals from high-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT). Some existing BCIs record electroencephalography (EEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) signals from patients and then decode these signals into instructions for operating some element of the outside world, such as a cursor on a screen, a prosthetic limb, or a virtual keyboard. This functionality can enable communication. However, BCI generally has had limited success and capabilities in CLIS patients with EEG or has relied on invasive technology such as ECoG or intracortical recordings, which require surgical placement of electrodes on or beneath the brain surface. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has recently achieved great success with decoding items viewed or heard by subjects (e.g., distinguishing from among >100 viewed images), fMRI requires bulky, expensive equipment that cannot be employed for routine BCI for patients with severe motor- related communication deficits. In contrast, optical imaging approaches, such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), employ portable, wearable hardware. These optical systems are non-invasive and use non-ionizing, near-infrared light to create movies of blood oxygenation and therefore provide physiological information comparable to the fMRI signal. NIRS has recently been applied as an alternative to EEG BCI for decoding simple yes/no responses in CLIS patients. However, NIRS systems suffer from much-lower spatial resolution than fMRI, which renders NIRS unlikely to match the decoding capabilities of fMRI. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT) combines the lightweight, low-cost equipment benefits of EEG and NIRS with higher spatial resolution closer to that of fMRI at the brain surface. Recent advances in HDDOT systems have enabled average spatial localization errors <5 mm and spatial resolution <17-20 mm (substantially better than NIRS). Studies have demonstrated detailed maps of both visual and language tasks. These properties make HDDOT an ideal candidate tool for decoding brain function. The fellowship training will provide a strong foundation in optical neuroimaging methods, machine learning, and brain-computer interface. These experiences will prepare the applicant exceptionally well for a career in biomedical engineering research and for developing technology that will improve these patients’ quality of life. Project Narrative: This project will develop decoding methods and evaluate their feasibility for using a high- performance optical brain scanner to identify and distinguish between imaging tasks in human subjects. The long-term goal of this research is to enable locked-in patients to communicate with others using augmented communication facilitated by a portable brain-scanning device, and a computer that decodes their brain signals.",Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface,10078847,F31NS110261,"['Adult', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Clip', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Imagination', 'Instruction', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Literature', 'Locked-In Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'career', 'cost', 'density', 'diffuse optical tomography', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'light weight', 'mental imagery', 'motor impairment', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive system', 'optical imaging', 'portability', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,29520
"BrainStorm: Highly Extensible Software for Advanced Electrophysiology and MEG/EEG Imaging Project Summary Electrophysiological recordings in humans and animals play an essential role in developing an understanding of the human brain. Signal recording technology spans the entire scale from invasive microelectrode single-unit recordings, through mesoscale macroelectrode measures of local field potentials, to whole-brain monitoring through measurement of scalp potentials (EEG) and extracranial magnetic fields (MEG). Analysis of these data presents a host of challenges, from low level noise removal and artifact rejection to sophisticated spatio-temporal modeling and statistical inference. The multidisciplinary neuroscience research community has an ongoing need for validated and documented open-source software to perform this analysis and to facilitate reproducible and large-scale research involving electrophysiological data. This proposal describes our plans to continue to develop and support Brainstorm, open-source software that meets this need. Brainstorm is a Matlab/Java multi-platform (Linux, MacOS, Windows) software package for analysis and visualization of electrophysiological data. The software is extensively documented through a series of detailed tutorials and actively supported through a user forum and a mailing list. Over the past 8 years we have registered 16,000 distinct users, provided hands on instruction to 1,200 trainees, and the software has been used and cited in ~600 journal papers. Brainstorm includes tools for importing MEG/EEG, intracranial EEG, animal electrophysiology, and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data from multiple vendors, extensive interactive features for data preprocessing, selection and visualization, coregistration to volume and surface MRIs and atlases, forward and inverse mapping of cortical current density, time-series and connectivity analysis, and a range of statistical tools. Data can be analyzed through a graphical interface or through scripted pipelines. The current proposal represents a plan to extend Brainstorm in a manner that leverages the unique features of our software and addresses important needs for large-scale data analysis. In this project we will continue to extend and support our software through the following three specific aims: (i) we will harness recent developments in distributed and shared data and high performance computing resources, together with standardization of data organization, to facilitate large-scale, reproducible analysis of electrophysiological data. (ii) We will also address the need for improved modeling resulting from the increasing use of both invasive recordings and direct brain stimulation through development of new modeling software for accurate computation of the intracranial electromagnetic fields produced by brain stimulation and neuronal activation. (iii) Finally, we will continue to add new functionality and to support the software through in-person training, online forums, documentation and other resources. Project Narrative Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG) are absolutely non-invasive brain imaging tools, which provide information on the spatial distribution and precise temporal orchestration of human brain activity. In addition to basic neuroscience research, MEG and EEG can be also used to understand and diagnose abnormalities underlying a wide range neurological and psychiatric illnesses, including epilepsy, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as cognitive deficits such as delayed acquisition of language.

"Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors ABSTRACT Aura is a digital health platform that uses Epilog™, a miniature, wireless, wearable EEG sensor worn on the scalp below hairline that can record clinical and subclinical seizures. After an initial diagnosis of epilepsy, an epileptologist will use known information about patients’ seizures to guide the best scalp location to place the Epilog EEG sensor (A). EEG data is continuously transferred (B) to the Aura app on a person’s smartphone (C) using secure BluetoothTM where it communicates over WiFi (D) to the Aura cloud platform (E). Epilog EEG is analyzed for seizures and a daily digital seizure diary is shared with epileptologists (F) and pushed back to the Aura app (G). Epilog is recharged daily, and reusable for a year. Epilog is designed to be discreet, allowing for continuous use in all facets of daily life. Data are a 10 s snippet of the beginning of a focal seizure with motor impairment and intact awareness (ILAE 1A1) recorded from Epitel’s single-channel Epilog sensor placed on the left forehead. The patient was admitted for video-EEG monitoring as standard-of-care. This seizure was verified independently by three epileptologists. In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are having (>50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary. In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of $380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures. These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability. Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy. This grant proposal aims to create a digital health platform that includes a wearable medical device worn on the scalp below the hairline. The system detects and counts seizures, and alerts to seizures in real time. The goal is to empower people with epilepsy to take control of their seizure monitoring and help improve the treatment of epilepsy.",Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors,10200346,U44NS121562,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auras', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Community Hospitals', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focal Seizure', 'Forehead', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Left', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurologic', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Seizures', 'Services', 'Sleep', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'System', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cost', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'digital health', 'effective therapy', 'encryption', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'remote monitoring', 'sensor', 'social', 'standard of care']",NINDS,"EPITEL, INC.",U44,2021,999853
"Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI Project Summary/Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool both clinically and in scientific research, with broad applications ranging from cognitive neuroscience to presurgical planning. FMRI can generate whole brain neuronal activation maps, yet it is an inherently low signal to noise ratio (SNR) method due to the relatively small changes in activation signal relative to the baseline signal. The overarching goal of this project is to develop and validate robust, high SNR fMRI by using a novel acquisition method, oscillating steady state (OSS) fMRI, along with machine learning (ML) techniques, to reconstruct high-quality images of the OSS fMRI data. OSS fMRI can increase SNR by >2x compared to the current state-of-the-art in fMRI acquisition methods, and this boost is roughly equivalent to the SNR gain going from a 3T MRI scanner to a 7T MRI scanner. The SNR increase is a direct result of the steady state approach. However, with a more complex, oscillating acquisition, OSS fMRI can be more susceptible to common MRI artifacts than traditional methods if left uncorrected. Two of the most common sources of MRI artifacts are changes in the main magnetic field (B0) due to physiological noise (such as respiration) and patient motion. This project will develop robust, high SNR fMRI at 3T by incorporating the effects of (1) B0 changes and (2) patient motion into the OSS signal model and image reconstruction algorithms. A new image reconstruction that incorporates neural networks will correct for B0 fluctuations and remove B0 induced artifacts. We will train a neural network to generate B0 field maps using data from a conventional, physics-based two echo field mapping technique to implicitly incorporate prior information of the physics into the reconstruction, while also providing a fast, ML-based field mapping method. To correct for subject motion, we will develop a neural network that estimates rigid-body motion parameters from sequential image frames in the fMRI scan. These motion parameters will be used in an iterative image reconstruction to produce high-quality resting-state and task-based fMRI, even in the presence of subject motion. The technology developed in this proposal will result in improved functional MRI that has the potential to significantly advance both the study of the human brain and the treatment of neurological disorders. The University of Michigan is one of the top research universities in the US, and provides an ideal environment and infrastructure to complete the proposed research strategy. The Functional Magnetic Resonance Laboratory and the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at UM have all the necessary hardware and computational resources needed for this project, including two state-of-the-art GE 3T MRI scanners and extensive GPU hardware for the machine learning components of the project. Furthermore, Drs. Jeffrey Fessler and Douglas Noll have proven expertise in fMRI image acquisition and reconstruction, as well as extensive mentorship experience, that will help guide this project and my training. Project Narrative Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to measure brain function, and it has revolutionized our understanding of cognitive processes during the last 25 years and has also been used as a tool for presurgical mapping of language and other sensitive brain regions. More recently, fMRI is being used as a biomarker for the progression of neurologic and psychiatric diseases, for example, in Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and major depression. In this project we will improve fMRI techniques by developing new methods that are more robust to common sources of MRI image degradation, which will improve the sharpness of the fMRI images without increasing instrumentation costs.","Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI",10196983,F32EB029289,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Left', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic Process', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'magnetic field', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'progression marker', 'reconstruction', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2021,66390
"Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis Chronic, clinically-impairing irritability is a serious health problem that affects 3-5% of youth and predicts both adult depressive and anxiety disorders and long-term impairment. Current studies on the neural mechanisms of irritability in youth employ traditional univariate analyses and have limitations: (1) they examine activation patterns in particular regions, thus using only a small portion of the data and (2) they tend to find small to moderate effect sizes. In addition, little is known about functional connectivity at rest and its association with irritability or the ability of neural measures to predict changes in irritability over time. These limitations could be addressed through research using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), i.e., by applying machine learning methods to both resting state and task-based fMRI data. MVPA exploits the full spatial pattern of brain activity and thus has increased sensitivity compared to conventional univariate, individual-voxel-based general linear model (GLM) approaches. However, univariate analyses may provide complementary or unique information relative to MVPA, given its sensitivity to variability and global engagement of task effects between subjects. The specific aims of this project are to identify patterns of whole-brain activation (Aim 1 & 2a, 2b) and functional connectivity at rest (Aim 2a, 2b) using a combination of MVPA and univariate approaches to predict (1) individual differences in irritability in a clinical sample of youth and in healthy youth with varying degrees of irritability, and (2a) individual differences in irritability and (2b) changes in irritability 6 months later in a community sample of youth with varying degrees of irritability. This work will provide new insights into the pathophysiology of multiple mental disorders for which irritability is an important symptom, and it has the potential to identify biomarkers that can be used to predict the course and prognosis of clinically-impairing irritability. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded investigator with a neuroscience-focused research program targeting developmental trajectories of irritability. To achieve this goal, the PI aims to expand her previous training to support both advanced, independent research on resting state and task-based fMRI and the use of pattern classification techniques, as well as their integration with univariate methods, applied in samples with varying degrees of irritability. This training objective directly supports the PI’s research objective, which is to identify the neural mechanisms of irritability and neural correlates that predict changes in irritability over time using a combination of MVPA and univariate imaging methods applied to task-based and resting state fMRI data. The central hypothesis, based on the PI’s pilot data, is that activity patterns during a frustration task, along with connectivity patterns at rest, will predict levels of, and changes in, irritability. Both univariate and MVPA approaches will converge on similar findings; however, MVPA will identify additional activation and connectivity patterns predictive of irritability or changes in irritability. The training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s research and professional skills and knowledge in three areas: (1) phenotyping clinically-impairing irritability; (2) task-based and resting state fMRI methods, designs, preprocessing, and advanced MVPA techniques, i.e., machine learning for analyzing fMRI data, and their integration with univariate analyses; and (3) professional skills essential for a successful research career as a faculty member at a research university. By completing the proposed research and training, the PI expects to obtain sufficient training to function as an independent developmental affective neuroscientist, and sufficient pilot data to submit a competitive R01 application designed to examine predictors of developmental changes in pediatric irritability across multiple levels of analysis from neural circuits, behaviors, social experiences, to environmental factors. The proposed project is relevant to public health because impairing irritability affects approximately 2.5 million youth in the U.S., and is a relatively common source of concern for clinicians, parents, and teachers. Clinicallyimpairing irritability in youth has been linked to adult psychopathology and is among the strongest predictors of suicidality across the life span. A better understanding of the neural markers underlying irritability and changes in irritability has significant potential to inform a better diagnostic classification system and to provide biomarkers for making treatment decisions, monitoring treatment responses, and predicting the developmental course of irritability.",Neural Mechanisms of Irritability: A Dimensional Approach with Integration of Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis and Univariate Analysis,10231183,R00MH110570,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Sciences', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Frustration', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Knowledge', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized predictions', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'social', 'teacher', 'time use', 'treatment response']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,R00,2021,236443
