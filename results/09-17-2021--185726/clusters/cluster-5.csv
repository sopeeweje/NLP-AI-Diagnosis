"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9693300,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EEG-based imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'automated analysis', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,676659,-0.04153201442407017
"Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to perform complex, yet previously un-practiced tasks successfully on the first attempt. We refer to this ability as `ad hoc self-programming': `ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; `self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. This type of learning differs importantly from trial-and-error learning, in which responses are sculpted incrementally, based on feedback from previous attempts. In comparison to trial-and-error learning, much less is known about ad hoc self- programmed learning, but it clearly represents a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The overall goal of our research proposal is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  There have been significant barriers to the study of this topic. Among them are the difficulty of studying these processes in animals who require training (which by definition precludes single-trial self- programming), and the lack of access to opportunities with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to study neuronal processes in humans.  The proposed research seeks to address this gap. We leverage critical advances in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and computational modelling, including: 1) availability of a large-scale recording platform enabling simultaneous recordings of 100+ neurons from the cortical surface; 2) opportunities to record from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in human subjects engaged in a custom-designed behavioral task; 3) developments borrowed from the artificial intelligence community to create advanced neural network models of complex cognitive processes.  By applying these innovative methodologies, we focus on addressing our overall goal with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine what information about the structure of a novel, complex, instructed task is represented in human dlPFC neuronal activity. We also determine how and when this information is encoded, in terms of spiking activity, oscillatory activity, or coherence between the two. In Aim 2, we determine the relationship between these neuronal representations and behavior. We investigate how the robustness and timing of the emergence of required neural representations relates to response accuracy and reaction time. In Aim 3, we develop a computational model of ad hoc self-programmed learning. To do so, we borrow from recent insights in the AI world regarding prefrontal network structure, and also apply our developing understanding of neural representations from the previous Aims.  We expect that this innovative approach will revolutionize our understanding of this amazing capacity for immediate, configurable learning that characterizes our everyday lives. In doing so, we will develop new strategies to study mechanisms of rapid, flexible cognitive control in general. A better understanding of human cognitive control and its nuanced capacities will naturally translate into an appreciation of deficiencies in these processes, and how they manifest in the form of neuropsychiatric disorders. This appreciation can then lead to the development of rational, targeted therapies. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations that we have never previously faced, but to which we must respond appropriately on the first attempt. The human brain's remarkable ability to rapidly reconfigure its cognitive circuitry to match new task demands and thereby enable such behavior is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.","Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex",9792299,U01NS108923,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amaze', 'Animals', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'computational basis', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,665648,-0.03801072467541533
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,9798264,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'axonal guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'programs', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,384007,-0.022086905033240827
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states. The work proposed here will inform approaches and therapeutic targets to restoring healthy brain dynamics.",Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties,9749197,R35GM124735,"['Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor output', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Work', 'base', 'cell motility', 'dynamic system', 'image processing', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R35,2019,396250,-0.024242775751728955
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9701324,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,613809,-0.024436616174321513
"Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making PROJECT SUMMARY To make good decisions in uncertain environments, humans build and update ‘mental models’ of relevant environmental statistics that can be used to make predictions and guide decision-making. When the environment changes, these models need to be adaptable to retain their predictiveness. This kind of adaptability typically involves key information-processing trade-offs that are well understood theoretically but have yet to be applied substantially to our understanding of human brain function and behavior. Here I examine systematically how these trade-offs, measured both from behavior and brain-imaging data, relate to the considerable variability in decision-making abilities that are typically evident across subjects and task conditions. My focus on behavioral, computational, and neural mechanisms of individual variability in decision-making abilities is particularly relevant to long-term research in mental health. Decision-making is severely disrupted in a number of mental illnesses including anxiety, schizophrenia, and addictive behaviors, but the exact mechanisms underlying these disruptions have yet to be fully elucidated. My central hypothesis is that individual and task-dependent differences in adaptive decision-making reflect systematic variability in the complexity of the mental models upon which the decisions are based. In the fields of statistics and machine learning, predictive models compress past observations into representations that can generalize to the future. A model’s complexity determines the flexibility with which this compression can account for new information. Complex models are more adaptive (low bias) but can overfit spurious observations, leading to more behavioral variability. In contrast, simpler models tend to have higher bias but lower variability. This tradeoff between bias and variance is well described in statistics and machine learning, but its influence on human mental models and decision-making behavior is not well known. The two primary aims of this project are: 1) to develop a principled measure of mental complexity that can be applied to human behavioral data; and 2) to identify the influence of mental model complexity on neuromodulatory brain networks involved in the mental exploration required for adaptive decision-making, and how activity in these networks differs across individuals. By linking a strong theoretical framework with methods from information theory, psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling, the current proposal will provide a novel lens with which to examine behavioral and neurobiological sources of individual variability in human decision-making. Moreover, the results of this research will provide crucial insights for interventions aimed at understanding and improving decision-making processes affected by mental illnesses. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the importance of adaptive behavior in our everyday lives, there are substantial gaps in our understanding of why adaptive processes differ between healthy individuals and how mental illnesses disrupt these processes. I propose that the ‘complexity’ of the mental models people use to interact with an environment accounts for many of these individual differences, with more complex mental models leading to ‘overthinking’ while learning, whereas less complex models to ‘oversimplify’ what needs to be learned. The goals of this study are to test the novel hypothesis that mental model complexity accounts for substantial individual differences in adaptive learning, and identify the neuromodulatory brain networks underlying these differences.",Measuring the role of mental model complexity on individual behavioral and neural differences in adaptive decision making,9758624,F32MH117924,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Affect', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Information Theory', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Norepinephrine', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Work', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'career', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'information processing', 'insight', 'lens', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'norepinephrine system', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F32,2019,61226,0.02883779485867476
"Mapping Brain-Cognition Relationships which Encode Cognitive Deficits in Refractory Epilepsy PROJECT ABSTRACT Epilepsy surgery involving the anteromedial temporal lobe (ATL) often results in deficits of language or memory. The best clinical predictor of postsurgical cognitive deficits is the extent to which tissues around the epileptogenic focus were spared during resection. We recently showed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) can predict normative variance in higher-order cognition; rs-FC has subsequently been shown to outperform lesion-based analyses for modeling stroke-related deficits of higher-order cognitions including memory. The proposed retrospective analyses of existing datasets will evaluate the prognostic value of rs-FC for modeling presurgical deficits of language and memory among patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 1 will replicate our methodology for relating rs-FC to cognitive ability using an independent normative sample of healthy control subjects acquired at Emory University. Aim 2 will evaluate the clinical utility of our method by modeling the influence of clinical symptoms (such as seizure frequency and laterality of epileptogenic focus) upon the relationship between rs-FC and presurgical memory and/or language deficits within a sample of patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 3 will use machine learning approaches to evaluate rs-FC's ability to explain presurgical cognitive deficits relative to other MRI modalities (such as anatomic volume, cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and task-based fMRI activity). The proposed model-based and hypothesis- driven research plan would critically evaluate resting-state fMRI's prognostic capability to explain epilepsy- related cognitive deficits, and thus establish the necessary methodological groundwork for future prospective analyses using rs-FC to predict postsurgical cognitive outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The PI has recently shown that patterns of functional brain connectivity during wakeful rest can predict higher- order cognitive ability. The proposed retrospective analysis would both replicate this methodology within an independent healthy normative sample and extend this methodology to predict presurgical cognitive deficits among patients with refractory epilepsy. This project would also use machine learning algorithms to evaluate resting-state connectivity's ability to predict cognition relative to other MRI modalities, thus establishing the necessary framework for future work using resting-state brain activity to predicting postsurgical cognitive outcomes.",Mapping Brain-Cognition Relationships which Encode Cognitive Deficits in Refractory Epilepsy,9640497,R03NS103000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Handedness', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Procedures', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical effect', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'data acquisition', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'language impairment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary analysis', 'stroke model', 'tool', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R03,2019,77920,-0.003406680180770691
"Big Data, Big Models, and Big Bias?: A decision making framework for vital rate estimates based on extrapolation Project Summary/Abstract The past decades have seen a flurry of methods that use extrapolation, smoothing, and other forms of information sharing to compensate for limited and incomplete data. In places without comprehensive vital registration or public health monitoring systems, extrapolation and information sharing techniques are particularly appealing, since there typically is simply not enough data available to produce estimates with sufficient temporal or spatial resolution to influence public health decision making. This proposal reframes uncertainty in extrapolated estimates of vital rates in terms of decision-making. A decision-making framework (i) is grounded in familiar language for policymakers and public health officials, (ii)characterizes consequential and inconsequential model decisions based on variability in outcomes, and (iii) in- corporates both extrapolation and sampling uncertainty. A cornerstone of this project is a novel collaboration with researchers and policymakers at the World Bank. Through this collaboration, we will pilot the proposed decision-making tools and conduct experiments with local and national policymakers in realistic settings. Project Narrative Predictions based on machine learning models are increasingly common inputs into decision making processes across scientific domains. In this proposal I develop and evaluate strategies for making public health decisions based on predicted vital rates, particularly in places without full coverage civil registration. Results from the project will improve strategies for allocating resources for disease surveillance and health monitoring in scarce resource settings.","Big Data, Big Models, and Big Bias?: A decision making framework for vital rate estimates based on extrapolation",9780910,DP2MH122405,"['Big Data', 'Collaborations', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Health', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'World Bank', 'base', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'novel', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP2,2019,2332500,0.016450392059774104
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,9767893,R01NS107357,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Experiments', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'direct application', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory recognition', 'memory retrieval', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'recruit', 'success', 'theories']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,359585,-0.02873926566300621
"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control Project Summary A fundamental question in human cognition relates to how motivational incentives influence behavioral goals. Monetary incentives are well known motivational influences on cognitive and neural processing, but few human neuroimaging studies have explicitly explored the whether and how integration of diverse incentives modulate cognitive task processing. This study aims to investigate how humans integrate primary and secondary incentives to influence cognitive processing of goal-directed tasks. We will use fMRI neuroimaging and computational approaches to test whether motivational signals from primary (liquid) and secondary (monetary) incentives are merged into a `common currency' that is used to bias cognitive processing and decision-making. We will also examine whether incentives of opposing valence will elicit a unified motivational conflict signal that is used to modulated cognitive control and higher-order decisions. Next, we will use multivariate pattern analysis (a machine learning technique) to investigate whether task representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are differentially modulated by monetary vs. liquid incentives. Lastly, we will utilize task-based functional connectivity analysis approaches to examine interactions between motivational and cognitive control brain networks. Specifically, we will examine how monetary and liquid incentives modulate functional properties of these two networks, with a focus on how incentive valence impacts the integration of these networks. We will utilize multiple task-based functional connectivity approaches in order to establish the most powerful method for examining task-based functional connectivity relationships, as well as understand more deeply the neural systems dynamics of motivation-cognition interactions. This project has direct relevance to drug addiction, as impairments in decision-making often accompany the pathological desires for drug-related stimuli. As such, this study will provide fundamental first step towards understanding the basic neural mechanisms that underlie how incentive integration impacts cognitive control and normative decision-making, which will provide a mechanistic framework that can inform how dysregulated neural mechanisms arise in drug addiction. Project Narrative Drug abuse and addiction are severe mental health disorders that affect 23.5 million Americans (9.3%) ages 12 and older in the United States. Much scientific evidence suggests that the maladaptive behaviors seen in drug addiction are linked to disruptions in the neural circuits that underlie reward processing and higher-order cognition, but these basic neural mechanisms of are not well understood. This study aims to understand how different types of incentives (e.g., primary, secondary) are integrated in terms of their motivational influence on cognitive processing in healthy humans, and this framework can be used to inform translational research on the neural mechanisms of drug addiction.",Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control,9616849,F31DA042574,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Parietal', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'financial incentive', 'graph theory', 'innovation', 'mind control', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,35344,0.000544418376706796
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown.

"AI-enabled fully automated retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeQuant, an AI-enabled fully automated tool to com- pute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenera- tive disorders. The large, growing, and aging population is likely to lead to a dramatic increase in the number of people at risk for dementia and other cognitive disorders, with more than 130 million people expected to be affected by 2050. Vascular disease is an important cause of dementia and cognitive decline in older people. The retinal microvas- culature, which can be non-invasively captured on color fundus photographs, share em- bryological origins, anatomical features, and physiological properties with the cerebral microvasculature. Biomarkers capturing structural changes in retinal microvasculature have been shown to be indicative of cognitive disorders in patients, including mild cogni- tive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, and vascular dementia. These structural vas- culature changes can manifest themselves earlier than any functional changes commonly associated with these cognitive disorders. A tool, such as EyeQuant, that can automati- cally and easily characterize these structural changes as biomarkers directly in primary care settings using fundus photographs, would enable early detection and effective man- agement of patients with cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders. Narrative EyeQuant is an AI-enabled fully automated tool to compute retinal image-based biomarkers for mild cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disorders. With more than 130 million people expected to be effected by dementia and other cognitive disorders by 2050, the burden and global annual costs of 818 billion USD is expected to increase significantly over the coming decades.

"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9614335,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discount', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,684196,0.007118015544033888
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9688607,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,385524,0.024940623991910493
"Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sustained attention – the continuous allocation of cognitive resources to respond to infrequent but behaviorally relevant stimuli – is impaired in many psychiatric disorders and represents an important aspect of cognitive control. Sustained attention requires top-down control and engagement with the external world, which is linked to both frontoparietal and thalamic controlling signals on primary sensor cortices. Despite the extensive behavioral characterization of sustained attention in animal models using the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), very little is known about the oscillatory interaction between the dorsal attention network and thalamo-cortical dynamics and its potential as a stimulation target for enhancing sustained attention. The objective of this project is to dissect the causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic stimulation. I will focus on three regions in the visual thalamo-cortical network: higher-order visual thalamus (lateral aspect of lateral posterior nucleus, LPl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and primary visual cortex (V1). I will test the central hypothesis that LPl-cortical theta (4-7 Hz) functional connectivity causally coordinates PPC-V1 functional connectivity to facilitate sustained attention. The rationale of this work is that the proposed temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetic perturbations will directly test the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention. Accordingly, the two specific aims are: (1) Delineate the functional role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention, (2) Determine the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetics. This work is significant because it will causally test a convergent model in which higher-order visual thalamus coordinates the parietal top-down control signals onto visual cortex that is crucial for developing circuit- based therapies to enhance sustained attention. The work is innovative due to its integration of closed-loop optogenetics circuit interrogation, multisite electrophysiology, freely-moving sustained attention task, and machine-learning tools for the investigation of the causal role of oscillatory synchronization. The overall positive impact of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive map of how the higher-order visual thalamus interacts with the frontoparietal control signal to modulate V1, and thus mediates sustained attention, a transdiagnostic cognitive function that shows impairment in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The implication of this study is that it may reveal a general mechanism underlying the interaction between two higher-order processing structures signaling to lower sensory cortices during cognitive processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sustained attention enables us to focus our cognitive resources on an activity for a prolonged period of time, and when impaired causes profound deficits in both cognition and behavior. Sustained attention is modulated by the thalamo-cortical rhythms. The research generated in this proposal will investigate (1) what oscillatory feature in the higher-order thalamo-cortical circuit is crucial for sustained attention, and (2) how the temporally- precise enhancing or disrupting of a thalamo-cortical oscillatory feature alters the functional connectivity in the circuit and behavioral outcomes mediated by sustained attention.",Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention,9835877,F31MH118799,"['Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Ferrets', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Impulsivity', 'Investigation', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'functional disability', 'innovation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'sustained attention', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2019,36528,-0.03384675367415293
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9654779,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2019,694087,-0.01859833028661906
"Neural Correlates of Familial and Non-familial ADHD SUMMARY Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent and heritable neurodevelopmental disorder. Neuroimaging studies have found that ADHD is associated with decreased volume of cortical and subcortical structures, delayed posterior to anterior cortical maturation, and dysfunction of fronto-striatal and thalamo- cortical networks. However, findings from these existing studies are highly inconsistent in terms of the structural and functional abnormality patterns. Beyond possible demographic and developmental factors, etiological heterogeneity of the disorder can be a significant component that contributes to the inconsistence of these findings. Among the complicated biological and environmental elements, familial heredity is the most significant factor for the emergence of ADHD. Relative to that in non-familial ADHD (ADHD-n), familial ADHD (ADHD-f) showed more severe executive dysfunction and much higher rate for persisting ADHD symptoms into adulthood. These findings suggest that ADHD-f may represent a biologically more homogeneous subgroup. However, neural substrates of familial vs. non-familial ADHD have not yet been well investigated. By utilizing advanced neuroimaging and analytic techniques, this research will assess the [parental history- related] familial risk influences on functional and structural brain organizations in children with ADHD. Two groups of ADHD (ADHD-f and ADHD-n)) and group-matched control children (TDC) will be involved. Based on extensive findings from existing neuroimaging and clinical studies conducted in our group and other groups, our general hypothesis is that compared to the TDC, both ADHD groups will show significant functional and structural alterations in frontal lobe and thalamus; while relative to ADHD-n, the ADHD-f group will show more severe functional and structural aberrance in frontal lobe and related circuitry. Our ultimate goal is to translate hypothesis-driven neurobiological correlates of the risk factors into clinically applicable biomarkers for guiding individualized interventions in ADHD. The findings of this research represent an important first step in the development of novel and refined intervention strategies for biologically homogeneous subgroups of ADHD. [This project will significantly enhance the research infrastructure and student education at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), by providing biomedical and behavioral science-related training and research experiences to undergraduate and graduate students, especially underrepresented minorities and females. This would allow them to acquire a broad spectrum of fundamental and advanced knowledge and skills in all clinical and technical aspects involved in human subject clinical and neuroimaging research, and develop a vast network of collaborations through the active biomedical and clinical scientists involved in this project. This AREA project thus has significant positive impact on academics and research at NJIT.] NARRATIVE Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is highly prevalent in the general population, with significant cognitive impairments that can exist throughout the lifespan. This project aims to elucidate the neural mechanisms of ADHD with vs. without positive [parental] history. The resulting data will identify potential biological markers for biologically homogeneous subgroups of the disorder, which will feed forward to improved diagnostic abilities, and lead to refined prevention and intervention strategies.",Neural Correlates of Familial and Non-familial ADHD,9729986,R15MH117368,"['Adult', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Elements', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Etiology', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heredity', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Inferior', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Modeling', 'Neurites', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'New Jersey', 'Nodal', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain volume', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'executive function', 'experience', 'feeding', 'frontal lobe', 'graduate student', 'gray matter', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'improved', 'information processing', 'maternal drug use', 'neural correlate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'parental influence', 'pediatric patients', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'prefrontal lobe', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'tractography', 'undergraduate student', 'white matter']",NIMH,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R15,2019,460500,-0.014586053446008182
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,9862231,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,450365,-0.015344807227065821
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD. It is hoped the results will help to improve diagnostic practices and inform development of new treatments.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD,9743874,K23MH108656,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Contingent Negative Variation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Research Activity', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'computerized', 'decision making algorithm', 'disease classification', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'millisecond', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurofeedback', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'positive emotional state', 'prospective', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stem', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,176167,-0.012457979530838244
"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the  cognitive neuroscience of empathy and altruism to take a neuroeconomic approach to understanding  excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Dr. Oathes), I will examine how deficits in affective and cognitive empathy may  independently contribute to selfish behavior, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Clinical disorders  including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and  empathic processing. It is hypothesized that individual variation in selfish behavior in the DG will be  independently predicted by decreased expression of brain-­wide multivariate patterns associated with affective  and cognitive empathy, centered on anterior insula (AI) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The third aim is to  examine the causal roles of the AI and TPJ in social preferences through the use of brain stimulation. Through  the use of TMS, we can disrupt neural processing in these regions, thus allowing for causal inference about the  roles of these regions in selfishness. It is expected that disrupting neural activation in the TPJ will cause an  increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI  will cause an increase in selfish behavior via disruption of affective empathy. Better computational  understanding of how affective and cognitive empathic deficits independently contribute to excessively selfish  tendencies, and how these deficits map to psychopathic and narcissistic traits, could inform individualized  clinical interventions utilizing excitatory brain stimulation to enhance the implicated empathic neural networks.  Project Narrative    While cooperation is a norm of human behavior, some individuals are excessively selfish, engaging in harmful  antisocial behavior with profound public health consequences. How deficits in affective and cognitive empathy  independently contribute to selfishness at the behavioral and neural levels is not well quantified. This research  will combine behavioral modeling and advanced cognitive neuroscience methods to computationally

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior. We employ a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies that investigate this interaction during a variety of cognitive tasks.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,9625164,R01MH071589,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Habits', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Paper', 'Perception', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual attention', 'affective neuroscience', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive task', 'emotional stimulus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'information processing', 'motivated behavior', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'reward processing', 'theories']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,383798,0.01600064956473207
"Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain's ability to efficiently carry out a task relies not only on the engagement of cognitive processes relevant to the task at hand, but also on the suppression of task-irrelevant cognitive processes. The inability to suppress task-irrelevant processes not only drives lapses of attention in everyday life, but also is characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, many patients with severe depression are unable to turn off negative ruminations. Neuroimaging work has identified distinct brain networks engaged in externally- versus internally-directed cognition, which exhibit opposite patterns of activity during both task and rest conditions. A default-mode network (DMN) activates when subjects engage in self-referential processes such as remembering a past event or planning for the future. The DMN also deactivates when subjects engage with the external environment, and decreased deactivation is associated with worse behavioral performance on such tasks. Conversely, a dorsal attention network (DAN) activates when subjects attend to stimuli in the environment. Control networks, which are thought to configure more specialized brain networks in order to carry out a task, have been shown to selectively link with task-relevant brain regions; for example, with the DMN when retrieving a memory, or with the DAN during visual search. However, the mechanisms of task- related deactivations are still unknown; for example whether they result from direct mutual inhibition between task-relevant and -irrelevant brain regions, or are mediated by a third set of regions such as the control networks. Moreover, while correlative evidence has linked the deactivation of task-irrelevant brain regions to better behavioral performance, there is no causal evidence in support of this idea. The proposed work aims to address these gaps by using electrocorticography (ECoG) to record electrical activity directly from human cortex with high temporal and anatomic precision, from regions previously shown by our lab to activate during memory (internal cognition) versus math processing (external cognition). We will track the dynamic interactions between, and relative timing of activity in, math-selective and memory-selective brain regions, as well as control-regions, during math versus memory processes (Aim 1). We will also use electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to transiently perturb activity in the above regions during math versus memory processes, to assess the causal function of task-related deactivations on behavior, as well as on the neural activity in task-relevant brain regions (Aim 2). This work has the promise to provide the training ground best suited for my desired career in systems neurosciences and electrophysiology, and the resulting knowledge may elucidate the dysfunctional neuronal communication thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To effectively achieve a goal, we must not only engage task-relevant cognitive processes, but also suppress task-irrelevant processes, the latter of which is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD. In the proposed research, we will study the fast dynamics of the relationship between activated and deactivated brain regions in two brain networks involved in internally- directed versus externally-directed cognition. We will also directly test the causal importance of task-related deactivations on behavior by electrically stimulating deactivated brain regions while subjects perform a task.",Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain,9598343,F32HD087028,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'learning strategy', 'memory process', 'memory retrieval', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trial comparing', 'visual search']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,18205,-0.007597136550480916
"The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning As animals move about in the environment, they must be able to rapidly assess and update the meaning of cues around them in order to approach reward and avoid danger. Reversal learning, a paradigm commonly used to test behavioral flexibility, involves switching the association between a stimulus and its outcome. For example, a tone that initially predicted a sweet tastant can come to predict a bitter tastant. Two brain regions, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), are involved in tasks that demand flexible responses to the changing significance of stimuli during reversal learning. While several studies have provided evidence that the OFC and BLA interact during reversal learning, little is known about the specific mechanisms of this interaction. In this grant, we propose to use a combination of genetic and cellular imaging techniques in mice to identify and characterize the physiological response properties during reversal learning of BLA neurons that project to OFC. The reversal learning task we employ involves stimuli of multiple modalities that predict outcomes of both positive and negative value to thoroughly elucidate the differential response properties of BLA neurons to stimuli that change their associated reinforcement outcome (Aim 1). In these experiments, the physiological response properties of neurons identified as projecting from BLA to OFC will be compared to the response properties of the overall population. Then, using an optogenetic approach, we will test the causal role of OFC input onto BLA neurons during reversal learning by inhibiting the specific projections from OFC to BLA to test their causal role on behavioral flexibility and on the nature of representations in BLA (Aim 2). The data analysis for both aims involves collaboration with theoretical neuroscientists to use linear classifiers and other sophisticated techniques to understand the nature and dynamics of neural encoding in BLA and its relation to behavior. These experiments promise to shed light on the mechanisms by which cortico-amygdalar circuits mediate flexibility critical for adaptive emotional responses and behavior, an ability that is impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders. This grant investigates the dynamic interactions between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during a reversal learning task involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. The study promises to elucidate mechanisms fundamental to the flexible updating of emotional behavior, mechanisms that likely become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders.",The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning,9676583,R21MH116348,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quinine', 'Research', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Update', 'Virus', 'anatomic imaging', 'behavior test', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'emotional behavior', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fluorophore', 'genetic approach', 'insight', 'lens', 'neurotoxic', 'optogenetics', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virus genetics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2019,243000,0.007547529635297793
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,9805996,K99MH120343,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Behavior', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Viral', 'cell assembly', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'goal oriented behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2019,129087,0.010979333247917736
"Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders PROJECT SUMMARY Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a leading cause of injury and psychological distress among middle school-aged adolescents, and occurs at higher rates in youth exposed to harsh parenting. Tradi- tional intervention programs that target those at risk for perpetrating aggression due to harsh parenting have had only limited success. This lack of success may be due to the fact that aggression is the product of complex decision-making processes that are influenced by current states of attention, arousal, and affect. A different approach is to prevent aggression before it happens by interceding when nonverbal indices signal a shift in these critical states. An essential first step towards establishing this prevention-based approach is to isolate nonverbal behavior that reliably predicts forthcoming aggression in high-risk adolescents. Eye gaze, pupillary dilation, and facial expressions are strong nonverbal behavioral candidates given that they are well-established indices of attention, arousal, and affective states. The current proposal uses computational modeling to test the predictive link between these nonverbal behaviors elicited during an ecologically valid social rejection paradigm and subsequent expression of peer-based aggression in adolescents (11-14 years; N=80) with high and low exposure to harsh parenting. Results will lay the groundwork for our long-term objective, to develop next gen- eration interventions aimed at preventing aggression the moment its behavioral precursors are detected. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a costly public health problem that is inadequately addressed by existing interventions. The goal of this project is to implement computational modeling to predict aggression in low and high-risk youth using nonverbal behavior elicited during social rejection and aggression- related decision-making. Next generation interventions can then be designed to prevent aggression when these nonverbal indices are detected.",Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders,9755465,R21HD093912,"['14 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anger', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eyelid structure', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Testing', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aggression prevention', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'junior high school', 'male', 'next generation', 'novel', 'peer', 'physical model', 'predictive test', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'success', 'virtual']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R21,2019,192906,-0.013639255344679689
"Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure and connectivity continue to develop through childhood and adolescence, developmental periods that are associated with substantial gains in memory and cognitive ability. While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia. Isolating the neural mechanisms that underlie changes in memory and reasoning ability from childhood to adulthood may thus help identify markers of atypical development and contribute to interventions that may improve both cognitive and academic outcomes.",Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration,9736791,R01MH100121,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'age related', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'spatial memory', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2019,661398,0.030769378009505962
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning. We will find the exact areas of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum that participate in this learning, and use machine learning techniques to understand how the activity of neurons recorded simultaneously in these brain areas can facilitate learning.",The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning,9818745,R01NS113078,"['Affect', 'Agonist', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cerebellar cortex structure', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Dentate nucleus', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fractals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Injections', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rabies virus', 'Reaction Time', 'Reading', 'Reflex action', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Work', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'human disease', 'kinematics', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'success', 'visual learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,1164920,-0.019914327696142115
"High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice PROJECT SUMMARY To understand neuropsychiatric disorders behavioral phenotypes, have to be linked to altered brain function and brain circuits. However, most neuropsychiatric disorders show a range of phenotypes and high variability making the association with neurological correlates difficult. Development of animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, have been facilitated by gene discovery through linkage analysis. Pharmacological treatments also model aspects of these disorders in rodents. However, comprehensive behavioral and physiological analysis is very time consuming. Moreover, common behavioral and physiological testing is performed in specialized apparatuses requiring handling of the rodents which in turn can affect their performance and lead to experimenter and environment induced variability. This it is difficult to observe multiple measures such as behavioral and neural activity in the same animal without perturbation and can capture developmental trajectories of disease progression and/or therapeutic intervention. We here aim to solve this problem by developing a new, flexible platform in which mice can be continually assessed within their home cage environments with a barrage of behavioral tests as well as neurophysiological measures (brain functional imaging) and optogenetic intervention.  Our system will include autonomous monitoring and control of brain activity within these home cages in the context of stimuli used to assess auditory sensory processing. The combination of the home cage environments with auditory learning paradigms provides a single platform for both training, assessment, and potential therapeutic manipulation. Our strategy will employ a collaborative effort to build home cages for up to 10 mice/cage, which can be housed continually for up to a 1-year period. Over this time, the animals will initiate self-directed trials of brain imaging, as well as auditory processing assessments.  A core feature of our system is the usage of relatively small footprint open source, Linux-based computer tools employing single board Raspberry Pi and Arduino computers. These systems will work together to enable the flexible home cage training and assessment system. The first goals are to refine the hardware and software to enable cross-laboratory collaboration and then wider dissemination of these tools to the broader neuroscience community.  We will test the home cages on specific lines of mice which have previously been shown to model autistic-like behaviors and uncover co-variation of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological deficits within and across the various models. NARRATIVE Relevance to public health: To study the underlying causes for many psychiatric and neurological disorders are unknown mouse models are used. To causally link sensory and behavioral deficits in mouse models of neurological disorders we develop an innovative mouse home cage that enable high throughput cognitive, behavioral, and physiological assessment of mice.

"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9749260,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2019,564964,0.0334216462770949
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9605296,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodal data', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2019,698908,0.014764128011899039
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,9685247,R37MH066078,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Educational Intervention', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Ensure', 'Episodic memory', 'Equation', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monozygotic twins', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resource Sharing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'causal model', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'connectome', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle intervention', 'longitudinal design', 'mental function', 'mindfulness', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'program dissemination', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2019,714063,0.011147925025055214
"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment conditions.",ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits,9851722,R01MH121246,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Face', 'Factor Analysis', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Informatics', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychopathology', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Social Processes', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'computational platform', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'druggable target', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient stratification', 'pleasure', 'quality assurance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'social', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1010160,-0.0032496971097116635
"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,9991267,R00AG054732,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Comparative Study', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Norepinephrine', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Psychological Theory', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'comparative', 'emerging adult', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'information processing', 'lens', 'neural network', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'young adult']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,248994,-0.003685443714752925
"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9824928,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,253798,-0.012100427907459637
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2.

"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2.

"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations. As part of this planned research, I will be trained in advanced modeling and neural analysis techniques, and complete a course of study on the use of deep neural networks. This training will take place under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Fusi and Dr. C Daniel Salzman in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. Despite broad relevance to understanding the mind, how people are able to learn and adapt to changes in their environments remains unknown. Numerous psychiatric dysfunctions as well as healthy neurotypical processes result in deficient ability to learn and update representations of complex, real-world situations. We will use electrophysiological techniques in nonhuman primates and advanced computational modeling to begin to investigate how people can so quickly learn and adapt to a complex world.",Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network,9754494,K99DA048748,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Behavioral Model', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Making', 'Drops', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Undifferentiated', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visuospatial', 'Weight', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'deep neural network', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neurotransmission', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2019,159052,-0.003659953609039028
"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9618883,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feeling', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'memory process', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,720901,0.015338966022297961
"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,9872014,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'loss of function', 'motivated behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2019,126090,-0.013901739110202998
"Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection. Brains transform sensory information into decisions and decisions into behaviors, which ultimately determine fitness. Behavior can be broken down into a set of discrete chunks of movement, called actions. The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions. My work aims to understand how striatal circuits perform action selection on a moment- to-moment timescale.",Dissecting the role of the direct and indirect pathways in moment-to-moment action selection.,9830975,F31NS113385,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anions', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Endoscopes', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Rhodopsin', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Stereotyping', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'calcium indicator', 'complement pathway', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'indexing', 'microendoscopy', 'miniaturize', 'optogenetics', 'study population', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,F31,2019,38342,-0.009173708285146869
"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9728374,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human model', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2019,381751,-0.007545949206246122
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9775436,R01DA047869,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,279706,-0.00463383596618892
"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9764342,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2019,34022,-0.007606482430225963
"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",9713394,R01MH119421,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endoscopes', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Opsin', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Virus', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fear memory', 'graph theory', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'neuronal excitability', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2019,355558,-0.005248664274726447
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9827920,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,260395,0.03710362047613451
"Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability ABSTRACT Cues or stimuli in the environment can guide behavior in adaptive ways, bringing one in close proximity to valuable resources (i.e. food, water, mates); but they can also elicit maladaptive behavior. For example, in addicts, exposure to cues (e.g. places, paraphernalia) previously associated with drug-taking often leads to relapse, despite the desire to remain abstinent. The ability of such cues to elicit complex emotional and motivational states and gain control over one's behavior occurs via Pavlovian learning mechanisms. Using an animal model that captures individual differences in response to reward cues, we can now study the neural processes underlying aberrant forms of cue-reward learning, bringing us closer to identifying novel targets for the treatment of addiction. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, some are “sign-trackers”—those that attribute incentive salience to the cue, and others “goal-trackers”—those that assign only predictive value to the cue. Thus, there is individual variation in the extent to which food cues are attributed with Pavlovian incentive motivational value (“incentive salience”), and this variation predicts the degree to which drug cues will attain control over behavior and the propensity to relapse. Furthermore, this animal model allows us to parse the incentive from the predictive properties of reward cues, and we have used it to demonstrate that distinct neural circuits regulate these different forms of cue-reward learning. In addition, we have shown that dopamine is critical for incentive learning (i.e. sign-tracking), but not predictive learning (i.e. goal-tracking). Most studies to-date, however, have been hampered by the inability to measure neural correlates of these phenotypes prior to learning. That is, rats must first undergo Pavlovian conditioning in order to be characterized as sign- or goal-trackers. Thus, the first Aim of the current proposal is to determine whether there are pre-existing basal differences in neurotransmitter signaling in the nucleus accumbens core that predict those individuals prone to attribute incentive salience to reward cues prior to behavioral testing. To do this, we will use a novel chemical analytical approach (stable-isotope labeling) that will allow us, for the first time, to assess true basal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA in sign- and goal-trackers. The second Aim will use another novel, but different, chemical analytical approach to simultaneously assess up to 50 neurochemicals in the nucleus accumbens core in sign- and goal-trackers. The focus of the second Aim will be on the neurochemical profiles that emerge as a consequence of an individual's associative learning style. Advanced statistical analyses will be applied in order to identify neurochemical profiles that best predict the behavioral phenotypes and to examine the relationship between neurochemicals over the course of learning. This work will highlight specific neural systems that may render an individual more susceptible to control by reward cues and lay the foundation for future studies to identify novel neuromolecular targets for the treatment of addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The way an individual responds to cues associated with rewards may be a key determinant of vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We will employ novel analytical approaches to uncover neurochemical signatures associated with individual variation in response to reward cues. These studies will identify pre-existing and experience-dependent neural mechanisms that allow cues in the environment to gain inordinate control over behavior, and could lead to novel targets for the treatment of addiction.",Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability,9716629,R21DA045146,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorides', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microdialysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'behavior test', 'classical conditioning', 'drug seeking behavior', 'executive function', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'incentive salience', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'reinforcer', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2019,233699,-0.009751571215698099
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9481191,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EEG-based imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,616434,-0.04153201442407017
"Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex Humans have a remarkable ability to flexibly interact with the environment. A compelling demonstration of this cognitive flexibility is our ability to perform complex, yet previously un-practiced tasks successfully on the first attempt. We refer to this ability as `ad hoc self-programming': `ad hoc' because these new behavioral repertoires are cobbled together on the fly, based on immediate demand, and then discarded when no longer necessary; `self-programming' because the brain has to configure itself appropriately based on task demands and some combination of prior experience and/or instruction. This type of learning differs importantly from trial-and-error learning, in which responses are sculpted incrementally, based on feedback from previous attempts. In comparison to trial-and-error learning, much less is known about ad hoc self- programmed learning, but it clearly represents a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The overall goal of our research proposal is to understand the neurophysiological and computational basis for ad hoc self-programmed behavior.  There have been significant barriers to the study of this topic. Among them are the difficulty of studying these processes in animals who require training (which by definition precludes single-trial self- programming), and the lack of access to opportunities with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to study neuronal processes in humans.  The proposed research seeks to address this gap. We leverage critical advances in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and computational modelling, including: 1) availability of a large-scale recording platform enabling simultaneous recordings of 100+ neurons from the cortical surface; 2) opportunities to record from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in human subjects engaged in a custom-designed behavioral task; 3) developments borrowed from the artificial intelligence community to create advanced neural network models of complex cognitive processes.  By applying these innovative methodologies, we focus on addressing our overall goal with three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we determine what information about the structure of a novel, complex, instructed task is represented in human dlPFC neuronal activity. We also determine how and when this information is encoded, in terms of spiking activity, oscillatory activity, or coherence between the two. In Aim 2, we determine the relationship between these neuronal representations and behavior. We investigate how the robustness and timing of the emergence of required neural representations relates to response accuracy and reaction time. In Aim 3, we develop a computational model of ad hoc self-programmed learning. To do so, we borrow from recent insights in the AI world regarding prefrontal network structure, and also apply our developing understanding of neural representations from the previous Aims.  We expect that this innovative approach will revolutionize our understanding of this amazing capacity for immediate, configurable learning that characterizes our everyday lives. In doing so, we will develop new strategies to study mechanisms of rapid, flexible cognitive control in general. A better understanding of human cognitive control and its nuanced capacities will naturally translate into an appreciation of deficiencies in these processes, and how they manifest in the form of neuropsychiatric disorders. This appreciation can then lead to the development of rational, targeted therapies. Project Narrative In our everyday lives, we frequently encounter situations that we have never previously faced, but to which we must respond appropriately on the first attempt. The human brain's remarkable ability to rapidly reconfigure its cognitive circuitry to match new task demands and thereby enable such behavior is a fundamental feature of human intelligence. The proposed studies leverage exciting new developments in neuroscience, neurosurgery, engineering, and artificial intelligence to understand the neuronal circuitry underlying this amazing capacity.","Mechanisms of Rapid, Flexible Cognitive Control in Human Prefrontal Cortex",9628299,U01NS108923,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amaze', 'Animals', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cities', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Architectures', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'London', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Programmed Learning', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visit', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,U01,2018,120000,-0.03801072467541533
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9534747,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,663541,-0.024436616174321513
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9531223,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,187784,-0.0008285094084811631
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,9576061,R01NS107357,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Experiments', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'direct application', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory recognition', 'memory retrieval', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'recruit', 'success', 'theories']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,359433,-0.02873926566300621
"2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar SUMMARY This proposal requests partial support for the fifth Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Neurobiology of Cognition, and for its associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) for trainees. The driving force behind the GRC is the rapid pace of convergent findings in molecular, cellular circuit and systems Neuroscience, augmented by technical developments in cell-targeting, imaging, computing and brain-machine interfaces. As a result, there are rapidly evolving descriptions of neuronal circuits and dynamics, neurophysiological processes and computational principles that underpin cognitive functions. The overarching goal of this GRC is to promote communication and collaboration across relevant levels of analysis and among empirical scientists, theoreticians and technical development specialists, emphasizing the most recent findings. The associated GRS, held just prior to the GRC, is designed to provide opportunities for doctoral and post-doctoral trainees to communicate their most recent findings and perspectives, and to prepare them for more in-depth participation in the parent GRC that immediately follows. Along with recent findings in traditional “core” areas such as memory and decision making, formal sessions will explore several new themes, including: 1) the evolutionary processes that have led to the human brain's cognitive abilities and 2) machine learning and its implications for cognitive neuroscience, 3) cognition in natural contexts 4) processing of sound for language, and 5) the brain as a network of interconnected areas. The program is highly interdisciplinary, bringing together behavioral, neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques in humans and non-human animals with computational approaches that explicate empirical findings and construct realistic models to represent the developing picture of cognitive operations and guide future experimentation. The program also underscores novel, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical approaches that promise to define fundamental principles of cognition, and to extend these to improved treatment of brain dysfunction. The format of the meeting promotes intensive interactions among investigators and trainees from different perspectives and analytic levels, and in particular, between experimentalists and theorists. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this conference is to promote communication and collaboration among empirical scientists and theoreticians working in the field of cognitive neuroscience with the focus on the improved understanding of the biological basis of language, perception, memory, social cognition and decision-making. Insights into the neural basis of these fundamental cognitive processes, will lead to improved diagnoses and treatment of many cognitive disorders with profound implications for society, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and autism.",2018 Neurobiology of Cognition Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar,9541371,R13NS106864,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Parents', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'System', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive task', 'design', 'driving force', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'language perception', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'operation', 'peer', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social cognition', 'sound', 'symposium', 'targeted imaging']",NINDS,GORDON RESEARCH CONFERENCES,R13,2018,5000,0.008431465509146918
"Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data. Project Narrative Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but patients' vaccination decisions may be more influenced by broadly circulated cultural beliefs than they are influenced by scientific evidence. This proposed research will systematically map the diversity of the publics' vaccination beliefs, assess how these beliefs influence vaccination decisions, and advise policy makers how to interface more directly with these popular belief systems that are critical to effective vaccination efforts.",Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making,9557573,R21HD087749,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anthropology', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Belief System', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Cultural Anthropology', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'General Population', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomathematics', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social space', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'vaccine safety']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2018,242266,-0.011643156115847273
"Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control Project Summary A fundamental question in human cognition relates to how motivational incentives influence behavioral goals. Monetary incentives are well known motivational influences on cognitive and neural processing, but few human neuroimaging studies have explicitly explored the whether and how integration of diverse incentives modulate cognitive task processing. This study aims to investigate how humans integrate primary and secondary incentives to influence cognitive processing of goal-directed tasks. We will use fMRI neuroimaging and computational approaches to test whether motivational signals from primary (liquid) and secondary (monetary) incentives are merged into a `common currency' that is used to bias cognitive processing and decision-making. We will also examine whether incentives of opposing valence will elicit a unified motivational conflict signal that is used to modulated cognitive control and higher-order decisions. Next, we will use multivariate pattern analysis (a machine learning technique) to investigate whether task representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are differentially modulated by monetary vs. liquid incentives. Lastly, we will utilize task-based functional connectivity analysis approaches to examine interactions between motivational and cognitive control brain networks. Specifically, we will examine how monetary and liquid incentives modulate functional properties of these two networks, with a focus on how incentive valence impacts the integration of these networks. We will utilize multiple task-based functional connectivity approaches in order to establish the most powerful method for examining task-based functional connectivity relationships, as well as understand more deeply the neural systems dynamics of motivation-cognition interactions. This project has direct relevance to drug addiction, as impairments in decision-making often accompany the pathological desires for drug-related stimuli. As such, this study will provide fundamental first step towards understanding the basic neural mechanisms that underlie how incentive integration impacts cognitive control and normative decision-making, which will provide a mechanistic framework that can inform how dysregulated neural mechanisms arise in drug addiction. Project Narrative Drug abuse and addiction are severe mental health disorders that affect 23.5 million Americans (9.3%) ages 12 and older in the United States. Much scientific evidence suggests that the maladaptive behaviors seen in drug addiction are linked to disruptions in the neural circuits that underlie reward processing and higher-order cognition, but these basic neural mechanisms of are not well understood. This study aims to understand how different types of incentives (e.g., primary, secondary) are integrated in terms of their motivational influence on cognitive processing in healthy humans, and this framework can be used to inform translational research on the neural mechanisms of drug addiction.",Neural Mechanisms of Incentive Integration and Motivated Cognitive Control,9345313,F31DA042574,"['Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Anterior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Experimental Designs', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Parietal', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'financial incentive', 'graph theory', 'innovation', 'mind control', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing']",NIDA,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.000544418376706796
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9483798,R01NS094659,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'biophysical properties', 'cell type', 'design', 'expectation', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'object shape', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatial integration', 'targeted treatment']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,350000,0.019566413769669028
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth.

"Mapping Brain-Cognition Relationships which Encode Cognitive Deficits in Refractory Epilepsy PROJECT ABSTRACT Epilepsy surgery involving the anteromedial temporal lobe (ATL) often results in deficits of language or memory. The best clinical predictor of postsurgical cognitive deficits is the extent to which tissues around the epileptogenic focus were spared during resection. We recently showed that resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC) can predict normative variance in higher-order cognition; rs-FC has subsequently been shown to outperform lesion-based analyses for modeling stroke-related deficits of higher-order cognitions including memory. The proposed retrospective analyses of existing datasets will evaluate the prognostic value of rs-FC for modeling presurgical deficits of language and memory among patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 1 will replicate our methodology for relating rs-FC to cognitive ability using an independent normative sample of healthy control subjects acquired at Emory University. Aim 2 will evaluate the clinical utility of our method by modeling the influence of clinical symptoms (such as seizure frequency and laterality of epileptogenic focus) upon the relationship between rs-FC and presurgical memory and/or language deficits within a sample of patients with refractory epilepsy. Aim 3 will use machine learning approaches to evaluate rs-FC's ability to explain presurgical cognitive deficits relative to other MRI modalities (such as anatomic volume, cortical thickness, white matter integrity, and task-based fMRI activity). The proposed model-based and hypothesis- driven research plan would critically evaluate resting-state fMRI's prognostic capability to explain epilepsy- related cognitive deficits, and thus establish the necessary methodological groundwork for future prospective analyses using rs-FC to predict postsurgical cognitive outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The PI has recently shown that patterns of functional brain connectivity during wakeful rest can predict higher- order cognitive ability. The proposed retrospective analysis would both replicate this methodology within an independent healthy normative sample and extend this methodology to predict presurgical cognitive deficits among patients with refractory epilepsy. This project would also use machine learning algorithms to evaluate resting-state connectivity's ability to predict cognition relative to other MRI modalities, thus establishing the necessary framework for future work using resting-state brain activity to predicting postsurgical cognitive outcomes.",Mapping Brain-Cognition Relationships which Encode Cognitive Deficits in Refractory Epilepsy,9528055,R03NS103000,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Frequencies', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Handedness', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Procedures', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical effect', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'data acquisition', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'language impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'secondary analysis', 'stroke model', 'tool', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R03,2018,77820,-0.003406680180770691
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9471432,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,385524,0.024940623991910493
"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9487337,R01MH109180,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,236692,0.011766233839070443
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9432559,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,729487,-0.01859833028661906
"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9444775,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discount', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,735735,0.007118015544033888
"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the  cognitive neuroscience of empathy and altruism to take a neuroeconomic approach to understanding  excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Dr. Oathes), I will examine how deficits in affective and cognitive empathy may  independently contribute to selfish behavior, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Clinical disorders  including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and

increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI

"Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The brain's ability to efficiently carry out a task relies not only on the engagement of cognitive processes relevant to the task at hand, but also on the suppression of task-irrelevant cognitive processes. The inability to suppress task-irrelevant processes not only drives lapses of attention in everyday life, but also is characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, many patients with severe depression are unable to turn off negative ruminations. Neuroimaging work has identified distinct brain networks engaged in externally- versus internally-directed cognition, which exhibit opposite patterns of activity during both task and rest conditions. A default-mode network (DMN) activates when subjects engage in self-referential processes such as remembering a past event or planning for the future. The DMN also deactivates when subjects engage with the external environment, and decreased deactivation is associated with worse behavioral performance on such tasks. Conversely, a dorsal attention network (DAN) activates when subjects attend to stimuli in the environment. Control networks, which are thought to configure more specialized brain networks in order to carry out a task, have been shown to selectively link with task-relevant brain regions; for example, with the DMN when retrieving a memory, or with the DAN during visual search. However, the mechanisms of task- related deactivations are still unknown; for example whether they result from direct mutual inhibition between task-relevant and -irrelevant brain regions, or are mediated by a third set of regions such as the control networks. Moreover, while correlative evidence has linked the deactivation of task-irrelevant brain regions to better behavioral performance, there is no causal evidence in support of this idea. The proposed work aims to address these gaps by using electrocorticography (ECoG) to record electrical activity directly from human cortex with high temporal and anatomic precision, from regions previously shown by our lab to activate during memory (internal cognition) versus math processing (external cognition). We will track the dynamic interactions between, and relative timing of activity in, math-selective and memory-selective brain regions, as well as control-regions, during math versus memory processes (Aim 1). We will also use electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to transiently perturb activity in the above regions during math versus memory processes, to assess the causal function of task-related deactivations on behavior, as well as on the neural activity in task-relevant brain regions (Aim 2). This work has the promise to provide the training ground best suited for my desired career in systems neurosciences and electrophysiology, and the resulting knowledge may elucidate the dysfunctional neuronal communication thought to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To effectively achieve a goal, we must not only engage task-relevant cognitive processes, but also suppress task-irrelevant processes, the latter of which is impaired in many neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD. In the proposed research, we will study the fast dynamics of the relationship between activated and deactivated brain regions in two brain networks involved in internally- directed versus externally-directed cognition. We will also directly test the causal importance of task-related deactivations on behavior by electrically stimulating deactivated brain regions while subjects perform a task.                ",Intracranial EEG and Electrical Stimulation of Deactivations in the Human Brain,9380291,F32HD087028,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrical Stimulation of the Brain', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'interest', 'knowledge of results', 'learning strategy', 'memory process', 'memory retrieval', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'trial comparing', 'visual search']",NICHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2018,58002,-0.007597136550480916
"Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) structure and connectivity continue to develop through childhood and adolescence, developmental periods that are associated with substantial gains in memory and cognitive ability. While such structural changes are well documented, we know little about the functions that HPC and PFC development confer, fundamentally limiting our understanding of the mechanisms of cognitive development. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the representational capacity of the HPC—PFC memory circuit transforms across development from a system that stores individual memories in childhood to a mature system in adulthood wherein cognitive maps represent the relationships among multiple episodes. Cognitive maps allow memory to extend beyond direct experience by coding unobserved relationships among multiple events. In the absence of a mature HPC—PFC system, such knowledge extension through cognitive map formation may be limited in children and adolescents, and therefore result in development differences in learning, decision making, and reasoning behaviors that require consideration of the relationships among multiple events. Moreover, the differential time course of HPC and PFC development, in which mature HPC function may emerge earlier than that of PFC, suggests there may be distinct patterns of memory representation and behavior in adolescence that differ from both childhood and adulthood. To answer these open questions, the proposed studies use a combination of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and sophisticated multivariate pattern analyses in children (7-9 years), younger adolescents (10-12 years), older adolescents (13-15 years), and adults (25-30 years). Using these methods, we will quantify: (1) age-related differences in HPC—PFC memory integration and separation strategies that support cognitive map formation and (2) how developmental differences in neural representation impact temporal (Aim 1), spatial (Aim 2), and event memory (Aim 3). Collectively, the results from this project will provide a key test of fundamental theories of cognitive development and substantially advance our knowledge of the representational capacities of the HPC—PFC memory system at different ages. In doing so, the findings have the potential to inform interventions designed to enhance memory and reasoning abilities that rely on cognitive maps, including in individuals diagnosed with mental health or neurodevelopmental disorders associated with memory deficits (e.g., autism, depression, Fragile X, or schizophrenia). . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The proposed research investigates how development of hippocampus and prefrontal cortex the human brain supports memory and reasoning during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. A growing body of empirical work has shown that difficulties with memory and reasoning in development are associated with poor academic outcomes, as well as with several mental health disorders with developmental onsets, including autism, depression, Fragile X, and schizophrenia. Isolating the neural mechanisms that underlie changes in memory and reasoning ability from childhood to adulthood may thus help identify markers of atypical development and contribute to interventions that may improve both cognitive and academic outcomes.",Hippocampal and prefrontal contributions to memory integration,9616654,R01MH100121,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retrieval', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'age related', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'spatial memory', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'virtual reality']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2018,701530,0.030769378009505962
"Crowdsourcing the Fly Connectome Project Summary We propose to build a next generation crowdsourcing platform (code named “FlyWire”) for mapping the fly connectome using transmission electron microscopy images that were acquired at Janelia Research Campus. FlyWire will depart from EyeWire, a previous crowdsourcing platform, in two major ways: (1) Much higher throughput will be attained by leveraging the latest in deep learning. (2) FlyWirers will consist mainly of fly neuroscientists, while EyeWirers were primarily nonscientists. Once minimum usability and functionality are achieved with the Murthy lab as the pilot users, FlyWire will be opened up to the entire Drosophila neurobiology community. All reconstructions will be shared by the community. To motivate productivity and accuracy, the reconstruction of a neuron and its outgoing synapses will be reported through a “micropublication,” with a quantitative formula for assigning authorship. To guide the development of FlyWire, the Murthy lab will reconstruct all presynaptic and postsynaptic partners of a subset of central brain neurons involved in sensory processing and behavior. We will use the connectome of these neurons as a launching point to investigate how feature­selective sensory responses arise and how they are decoded to change behavior. We will also create software tools for matching FlyWire neurons with light microscopic reconstructions of neurons. The proposed project will complement Janelia’s efforts to obtain the fly connectome with FIB­SEM imaging. Janelia’s final FIB­SEM connectome is estimated to take up to five years, though draft connectomes should become available sooner. FlyWire will provide Drosophila neuroscientists with badly needed information about connectivity in the years before the FIB­SEM connectome becomes available. Multiple connectomes will enable the study of variability across individuals and between sexes (FlyWire will reconstruct a female brain, while the first FIB­ SEM connectome will be of a male brain.) Project Narrative We propose to build a next generation platform for crowdsourcing the fly connectome to a community of neuroscientists. The fly connectome will accelerate progress in circuit neuroscience. The methods developed by the project will be relevant for future discovery of connectopathies.",Crowdsourcing the Fly Connectome,9610061,RF1MH117815,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Authorship', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Electrons', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Female', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Names', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Peer Review', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Transmission Electron Microscopy', 'Vertebral column', 'behavior change', 'communication behavior', 'community organizations', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'fly', 'imaging Segmentation', 'interest', 'male', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'next generation', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'retinal neuron', 'sex', 'tool', 'usability']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2018,1612437,-0.015290981011055603
"Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders PROJECT SUMMARY Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a leading cause of injury and psychological distress among middle school-aged adolescents, and occurs at higher rates in youth exposed to harsh parenting. Tradi- tional intervention programs that target those at risk for perpetrating aggression due to harsh parenting have had only limited success. This lack of success may be due to the fact that aggression is the product of complex decision-making processes that are influenced by current states of attention, arousal, and affect. A different approach is to prevent aggression before it happens by interceding when nonverbal indices signal a shift in these critical states. An essential first step towards establishing this prevention-based approach is to isolate nonverbal behavior that reliably predicts forthcoming aggression in high-risk adolescents. Eye gaze, pupillary dilation, and facial expressions are strong nonverbal behavioral candidates given that they are well-established indices of attention, arousal, and affective states. The current proposal uses computational modeling to test the predictive link between these nonverbal behaviors elicited during an ecologically valid social rejection paradigm and subsequent expression of peer-based aggression in adolescents (11-14 years; N=80) with high and low exposure to harsh parenting. Results will lay the groundwork for our long-term objective, to develop next gen- eration interventions aimed at preventing aggression the moment its behavioral precursors are detected. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a costly public health problem that is inadequately addressed by existing interventions. The goal of this project is to implement computational modeling to predict aggression in low and high-risk youth using nonverbal behavior elicited during social rejection and aggression- related decision-making. Next generation interventions can then be designed to prevent aggression when these nonverbal indices are detected.",Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders,9791513,R21HD093912,"['14 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anger', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eyelid structure', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Testing', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aggression prevention', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'junior high school', 'male', 'next generation', 'novel', 'peer', 'physical model', 'predictive test', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'success', 'virtual']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R21,2018,232781,-0.013639255344679689
"High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice PROJECT SUMMARY To understand neuropsychiatric disorders behavioral phenotypes, have to be linked to altered brain function and brain circuits. However, most neuropsychiatric disorders show a range of phenotypes and high variability making the association with neurological correlates difficult. Development of animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, have been facilitated by gene discovery through linkage analysis. Pharmacological treatments also model aspects of these disorders in rodents. However, comprehensive behavioral and physiological analysis is very time consuming. Moreover, common behavioral and physiological testing is performed in specialized apparatuses requiring handling of the rodents which in turn can affect their performance and lead to experimenter and environment induced variability. This it is difficult to observe multiple measures such as behavioral and neural activity in the same animal without perturbation and can capture developmental trajectories of disease progression and/or therapeutic intervention. We here aim to solve this problem by developing a new, flexible platform in which mice can be continually assessed within their home cage environments with a barrage of behavioral tests as well as neurophysiological measures (brain functional imaging) and optogenetic intervention.  Our system will include autonomous monitoring and control of brain activity within these home cages in the context of stimuli used to assess auditory sensory processing. The combination of the home cage environments with auditory learning paradigms provides a single platform for both training, assessment, and potential therapeutic manipulation. Our strategy will employ a collaborative effort to build home cages for up to 10 mice/cage, which can be housed continually for up to a 1-year period. Over this time, the animals will initiate self-directed trials of brain imaging, as well as auditory processing assessments.  A core feature of our system is the usage of relatively small footprint open source, Linux-based computer tools employing single board Raspberry Pi and Arduino computers. These systems will work together to enable the flexible home cage training and assessment system. The first goals are to refine the hardware and software to enable cross-laboratory collaboration and then wider dissemination of these tools to the broader neuroscience community.  We will test the home cages on specific lines of mice which have previously been shown to model autistic-like behaviors and uncover co-variation of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological deficits within and across the various models. NARRATIVE Relevance to public health: To study the underlying causes for many psychiatric and neurological disorders are unknown mouse models are used. To causally link sensory and behavioral deficits in mouse models of neurological disorders we develop an innovative mouse home cage that enable high throughput cognitive, behavioral, and physiological assessment of mice. We will test this system on multiple mouse models of auditory spectrum disorders to uncover novel covariation in the cognitive, behavioral, and physiological phenotypes.",High throughput home cage platforms for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders in mice,9601457,R21MH116450,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Custom', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'House mice', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Linux', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Mus', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Operant Conditioning', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Raspberries', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Self-Direction', 'Sensory', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Hierarchy', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wild Animals', 'Work', 'animal model development', 'auditory processing', 'base', 'behavior test', 'flexibility', 'gene discovery', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2018,209328,-0.0002849637429582566
"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD.

"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function.

This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9744955,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2018,72839,0.0334216462770949
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9506737,R01DA038891,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,326829,0.012910809502713968
"Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability ABSTRACT Cues or stimuli in the environment can guide behavior in adaptive ways, bringing one in close proximity to valuable resources (i.e. food, water, mates); but they can also elicit maladaptive behavior. For example, in addicts, exposure to cues (e.g. places, paraphernalia) previously associated with drug-taking often leads to relapse, despite the desire to remain abstinent. The ability of such cues to elicit complex emotional and motivational states and gain control over one's behavior occurs via Pavlovian learning mechanisms. Using an animal model that captures individual differences in response to reward cues, we can now study the neural processes underlying aberrant forms of cue-reward learning, bringing us closer to identifying novel targets for the treatment of addiction. When rats are exposed to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm wherein a discrete cue is repeatedly paired with presentation of a reward, some are “sign-trackers”—those that attribute incentive salience to the cue, and others “goal-trackers”—those that assign only predictive value to the cue. Thus, there is individual variation in the extent to which food cues are attributed with Pavlovian incentive motivational value (“incentive salience”), and this variation predicts the degree to which drug cues will attain control over behavior and the propensity to relapse. Furthermore, this animal model allows us to parse the incentive from the predictive properties of reward cues, and we have used it to demonstrate that distinct neural circuits regulate these different forms of cue-reward learning. In addition, we have shown that dopamine is critical for incentive learning (i.e. sign-tracking), but not predictive learning (i.e. goal-tracking). Most studies to-date, however, have been hampered by the inability to measure neural correlates of these phenotypes prior to learning. That is, rats must first undergo Pavlovian conditioning in order to be characterized as sign- or goal-trackers. Thus, the first Aim of the current proposal is to determine whether there are pre-existing basal differences in neurotransmitter signaling in the nucleus accumbens core that predict those individuals prone to attribute incentive salience to reward cues prior to behavioral testing. To do this, we will use a novel chemical analytical approach (stable-isotope labeling) that will allow us, for the first time, to assess true basal levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, acetylcholine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA in sign- and goal-trackers. The second Aim will use another novel, but different, chemical analytical approach to simultaneously assess up to 50 neurochemicals in the nucleus accumbens core in sign- and goal-trackers. The focus of the second Aim will be on the neurochemical profiles that emerge as a consequence of an individual's associative learning style. Advanced statistical analyses will be applied in order to identify neurochemical profiles that best predict the behavioral phenotypes and to examine the relationship between neurochemicals over the course of learning. This work will highlight specific neural systems that may render an individual more susceptible to control by reward cues and lay the foundation for future studies to identify novel neuromolecular targets for the treatment of addiction. PROJECT NARRATIVE The way an individual responds to cues associated with rewards may be a key determinant of vulnerability to addiction and relapse. We will employ novel analytical approaches to uncover neurochemical signatures associated with individual variation in response to reward cues. These studies will identify pre-existing and experience-dependent neural mechanisms that allow cues in the environment to gain inordinate control over behavior, and could lead to novel targets for the treatment of addiction.",Identification of Neurochemical Antecedents and Consequences of Distinct Learning Processes Relevant to Addiction Liability,9527977,R21DA045146,"['Acetylcholine', 'Address', 'Algorithm Design', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Chlorides', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microdialysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motivation', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'behavior test', 'classical conditioning', 'drug seeking behavior', 'executive function', 'experience', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'incentive salience', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'motivated behavior', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'reinforcer', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sample collection', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2018,208699,-0.009751571215698099
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9484214,K01AG051348,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'imaging study', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2018,131400,-3.283104616616054e-05
"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9470566,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2018,754642,0.014764128011899039
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training).

"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9608495,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2018,1202962,-0.019006239656796924
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9692121,R01DA047869,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,254642,-0.00463383596618892
"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9563948,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2018,33530,-0.007606482430225963
"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9238947,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feeling', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'addiction', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'memory process', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'statistics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,777587,0.015338966022297961

"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems. Representational approaches to RL are already of intense interest within industry, where the present investigators have a record of active engagement. The topic of the proposed work has applicability in other areas as well, including education and training, and military and medical decision support. The plan for the project has a robust training component at both graduate and postdoctoral levels, with a commitment to fostering involvement of underrepresented minorities, as well as international engagement. n/a",CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial ,9292377,R01MH109177,"['Achievement', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'computational neuroscience', 'developmental psychology', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'research based learning', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'success', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,373529,0.029381079237213885
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9331744,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'EEG-based imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,193734,-0.04153201442407017
"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9402671,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohesion', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experimental study', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social stigma', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2017,237,-0.007512898120506462
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states.

"Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment SUMMARY Detecting the first and earliest stages of cognitive decline, conceptualized as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI), has become increasingly important in recent years, as research focuses on delaying the manifestations of more severe stages of decline. It is now well recognized that changes in performance on cognitive tests begin up to ten years (or longer) before clinically apparent symptoms of dementia or functional impairment appear. Conventional assessment methods for assessing cognition Conventional assessment methods typically use the spoken response modality in which subjects are asked to verbally respond to prompts, and examiners carefully listen to these responses and apply test manuals to compute scores. These assessment methods require trained specialists and can be burdensome because they need to performed in clinics, especially so with frequent reassessment. Automating the scoring of assessment is important, not only for alleviating this burden but also for enabling large-scale studies on new intervention methods. Our research goal is to automate detection of MCI by developing, applying, and evaluating a system for automation of verbal (i.e., using spoken responses) cognitive-test scoring. Focusing on four verbal cognitive tests, we develop an extensible system comprising ASR and machine-learning algorithms to automatically score responses, and measure the efficacy of our proposed method by validating the accuracy of the automatically obtained scores against gold-standard, clinically obtained scores (Aim 1). Next, we develop classification methods for detecting individuals with MCI based on all information available in the verbal responses, and validating this classification against gold-standard clinical consensus. NARRATIVE Early detection of mild cognitive disease (MCI) is significantly important to delay more severe stages of cognitive decline. Conventional assessment methods require trained specialists and can be financially beyond the reach of most. We propose a tool for automatically scoring verbal cognitive tests. The proposed tool can be embedded in electronic devices providing the opportunity to assess large number of people in their homes, enabling clinicians to focus on those who are most at risk of cognitive decline.",Automated Assessment of Cognitive Tests for Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment,9297093,R21AG055749,"['Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Automation', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronics', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Vascular Cognitive Impairment', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'cooperative study', 'design', 'functional disability', 'healthy aging', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'response', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NIA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,184739,-0.0008285094084811631

"Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data. Project Narrative Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but patients' vaccination decisions may be more influenced by broadly circulated cultural beliefs than they are influenced by scientific evidence. This proposed research will systematically map the diversity of the publics' vaccination beliefs, assess how these beliefs influence vaccination decisions, and advise policy makers how to interface more directly with these popular belief systems that are critical to effective vaccination efforts.",Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making,9241259,R21HD087749,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anthropology', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Belief System', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Cultural Anthropology', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'General Population', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomathematics', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social space', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'vaccine safety']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2017,239723,-0.011643156115847273
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9361299,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,706183,-0.00029946827218942193
"Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Project Narrative This project examines the mechanisms underlying decline of semantic memory (memory for knowledge) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational models. This research will develop methods for testing neurocognitive theories of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, inform interventions for mitigating decline, and further our understanding of how the disease spreads.",Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease,9334048,R21AG053467,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Free Association', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavioral impairment', 'computerized tools', 'contagion', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'memory retrieval', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2017,193393,-0.043724753005756775
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies.

"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9383530,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'design', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'psychological distress', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,666777,-0.024436616174321513
"The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risky behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use, and teenaged sexual intercourse are all heavily influenced by the behaviors of one's peers. While much is known about the neural networks involved in risky decision-making, this research has largely been conducted in the absence of the rich network of social information available when making risky decisions in real-life. Given the large body of evidence suggesting the importance of information about peers' choices when making risky decisions, it is of great public-health relevance to understand how the integration of this information into the risky decision takes place at the neural level, and, particularly, what differences in processing of this information lead some people to be more susceptible to peer influence than others. The proposed research aims to answer these questions by having a sample of 50 14-19 year olds perform a novel real-stakes social gambling task in the scanner. In this task, participants will make choices about a series of risky gambles, on each trial receiving false information about the decisions of four of their friends who previously completed the task. Using the reported percentage of risk acceptance as a parametric modulator, we will identify regions in the brain where BOLD activation encodes information about others' choice behavior. Second, we will calculate a peer susceptibility score for each subject based on their choices in the task, reflecting how much their choices were swayed by the reported actions of others. We will then use a machine-learning based regression technique to generate a spatial pattern of regression weights that can predict each participant's behavioral susceptibility to peer influence. The strength of these regression weights in different areas of the brain reflects how strongly encoding of others' choices in that region predicts individuals' peer susceptibility scores. These data allow us to: 1) Identify patterns of encoding of others' choice information that are most strongly predictive of being highly susceptible to peer influence, and 2) Generate a neurologic signature that can be used in new samples of participants to predict their level of susceptibility to peer influence. We will then compare predictions of peer susceptibility derived from the brain data to patterns of real-world risk-taking of the participant and their peers. We believe that thes findings can set the stage for future work examining developmental changes in these networks, and how responses in these networks can be altered by exposure to different types of peers or by potential interventions designed to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in specific domains. These avenues of research will allow for the accelerated development of more precise and effective intervention strategies to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in the domain of publi-health relevant risk-taking. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The risky actions of peers strongly influence individuals' risk-taking behavior. This research will examine how information about peers' risky choices are represented in the brain, develop a set of neural markers that can predict the extent to which an individual will be influenced by the actions of their peers, based on their encoding of the peers' choices, and examine relations between these neural markers and susceptibility to peer influence in real-world risk-taking.",The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making,9247017,R21HD086375,"['19 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Choice Behavior', 'Coitus', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Divorce', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Punishment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cognitive control', 'effective intervention', 'information processing', 'interest', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'parental involvement', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'therapy design', 'willingness']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2017,190000,-0.0037671724173779144
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9318580,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,382414,0.024940623991910493
"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9275028,R01MH109180,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Dimensions', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,241790,0.011766233839070443
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9301669,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2017,709268,-0.01859833028661906
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychopathology arising from a disruption of emotional function affects over 400 million people globally, yet we lack a neurobiological model to guide classification and treatment.

"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia). The project will examine mechanisms of normal cognitive aging using computational modeling, which can inform the early detection, differential diagnosis, and treatment monitoring of age-related neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.

"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD. It is hoped the results will help to improve diagnostic practices and inform development of new treatments.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD,9323594,K23MH108656,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Contingent Negative Variation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Reaction Time', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research Activity', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'computerized', 'disease classification', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'millisecond', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurofeedback', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'positive emotional state', 'prospective', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stem', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,192686,-0.012457979530838244
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9308020,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2017,492125,0.0334216462770949
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,9278065,K01AG051348,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'analytical tool', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'imaging study', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2017,131400,-3.283104616616054e-05
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9333297,R01DA038891,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Vertebrates', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'data management', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human subject protection', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,328543,0.01354445277357879
"Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice PROJECT SUMMARY We often consider our movements a result of sensory processing – sensation guides behavior. However, animals selectively shape future sensory input through their own actions in a process known as active sampling. Thus, action and sensation are inextricably linked. Despite this, much of the research done on sensory processing restricts movement, most commonly via head fixation. To access sensorimotor processing during more natural behavior, we will study olfactory navigation in freely-moving mice. The olfactory system is ideal for studying sensory sampling, because of its ethological relevance for mammalian foraging and the dynamic nature of airborne odor stimuli. The proposed research will determine the sampling strategies of olfactory search and reveal the underlying circuitry that connects sensation with motion. Aim 1. It is unknown how rodents navigate dynamic plumes of odorant towards an odor source. In this aim, we will identify, analyze, and model active sensing behaviors that occur during increasingly difficult navigation tasks and with single nostrils occluded. These experiments will test the hypothesis that olfactory navigation works as a sensorimotor closed-loop system, where animals optimize sampling behaviors for the current stimulus conditions. These behavioral studies will lay the foundation for investigations of sensorimotor processing in dynamic olfactory scenes. Aim 2. To determine how sampling movements shape sensation, we will monitor neural activity during active sensory behavior. During odor tracking, we will electrophysiologically record in the olfactory bulb, a bottleneck through which all sensory input passes. We will determine the sensory history dependence of active sampling and, in doing so, reveal part of the underlying circuitry that connects motion with sensation. These experiments will test the hypothesis that sampling movements are sensory history dependent. To our knowledge, sampling movements and sensory activity have never been simultaneously recorded during olfactory navigation. This research will advance our understanding of the interplay between sensation and motion during natural behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE Deficits in sensory motor communication are a major contributor to prevalent neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our assay of olfactory navigation will model the interaction between sensation and movement and identify the circuitry through which movements are decided by sensory input. Discovering mechanisms of sensorimotor integration are the key to a better understanding of sensory processing in these disorders, since sensation and action are inextricably linked.",Active Sensation during Odor-Guided Navigation in Mice,9470632,F31DC016799,"['Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Head', 'Implant', 'Intake', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Nose', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Respiration', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Smell Perception', 'Source', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vertebrates', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'design', 'experimental study', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'olfactory bulb', 'olfactory stimulus', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2017,33050,-0.007606482430225963
"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems. Representational approaches to RL are already of intense interest within industry, where the present investigators have a record of active engagement. The topic of the proposed work has applicability in other areas as well, including education and training, and military and medical decision support.

"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9176279,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2016,574983,-0.04153201442407017
"Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I aim to identify a data-driven taxonomy of depression and anxiety from multiple neurobiological measures of brain function, physiology and behavior that is not constrained by existing diagnostic boundaries. Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder are highly prevalent and together cost over $100 billion per year in care and lost productivity. While the symptoms used in the diagnosis of these disorders convey useful information and reflect real phenomenology, the way in which symptoms are grouped makes for ""fuzzy"" diagnostic boundaries, with substantial symptom overlap across disorders, yet vast symptom heterogeneity within. Moreover, experiments aiming to identify the neural contribution to dysfunction have been intrinsically tied to these traditional diagnostic categories As a consequence, we do not have a clear understanding of how the neural circuitry underlying depression and anxiety relates to the expressed symptoms at the level of physiology and behavior, independent from these traditional diagnoses. These blurry diagnostic lines hamper our progress toward understanding the mechanisms of dysfunction and developing novel, targeted therapeutics. Therefore, it would be beneficial to establish a complementary characterization of anxiety and depression that reflects cohesive clusters of distinct neural causes. Addressing these issues I propose to use a data driven approach to develop an alternate classification for depression and anxiety. Under Aim 1 I will use computational methods on a rich existing dataset of over 600 participants, to derive dimensional constructs of emotion processing from neuroimaging probes of emotion reactivity and regulation and determine how these constructs are associated with other levels of function spanning behavior, physiology and self-report. Under Aim 2 I will use sparse clustering algorithms to classify individual subjects according to the neuroimaging constructs and then determine how each classification is expressed across behavioral, physiological and self-report symptom measures, independent of traditional diagnosis. To address Aim 3 I will use experimental stress probes to parse state versus trait-like components of the relationships between neuroimaging and each other unit of measurement. The outcome will be a novel classification that will advance our progress toward both understanding the mechanisms of neural dysfunction in depression and anxiety as well as developing novel therapeutics for targeting such dysfunction. Critically, the proposed multi-modal approach utilizes unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify the underlying patterns within this complex system in a manner that is free from the assumptions of the current diagnostic paradigms. The resulting characterization from this approach will provide a dimensional space to understand the natural variation in neural circuit function and how this variation relates to each person's functional phenotype. Such a characterization will be a significant step forward in transforming the way that depression and anxiety are understood, removing stigma, and allowing novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Anxiety Disorders and Major Depressive Disorder, which are among the most frequently occurring psychiatric conditions and are associated with serious personal and societal cost, are still defined by a set of descriptive symptoms that are ignorant to the underlying neurobiology. This proposal uses advanced computational methods to identify an alternative, yet complementary, model of depression and anxiety directly linked to brain function, physiology and behavior. The resulting characterization would provide a novel, biologically based dimensional space to understand an individual's symptom profile, transform the way the way that depression and anxiety are understood and allow novel treatments to be developed from mechanistic models that can be more effectively translated to the clinic.            ",Neuroimaging and Machine Learning to Redefine Anxiety and Depression,9120715,F32MH108299,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Face', 'Functional disorder', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute stress', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'comparison group', 'cost', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'phenomenological models', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'social stigma', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2016,50507,-0.007512898120506462
"Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease Project Summary To interact, communicate, and navigate the world successfully, people must retrieve relevant information from their semantic memory (memory for facts and general knowledge). Individuals with Alzheimer's disease have difficulty retrieving such knowledge from early in the course of the disease and progressively gets worse as the disease spreads, a process known as semantic decline. This project examines the mechanisms underlying semantic decline in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational tools. The extent to which semantic memory is impaired in individuals with Alzheimer's disease can be probed using behavioral experiments. Individuals with Alzheimer's as well as those at-risk for the disease display a pattern of behavior on these tasks distinct from healthy individuals. Despite decades of research, explanations of these behavioral impairments focus almost exclusively on cognitive mechanisms that may explain a patient's current behavior at a given time point, but without an account of the transition from normal, pre-symptomatic behavior to fully impaired behavior. Existing models fail to explain the mechanisms by which semantic memory and memory retrieval processes degrade over time due to Alzheimer's, limiting our understanding of the development of the disease, as well as hindering our ability for prognosis, early detection measures, and possible interventions. This project will test computational models of how the disease spreads, making specific quantitative predictions about the decline of semantic memory. Additionally, we will develop a novel machine learning method that can be used to map the structure of an individual's semantic memory, creating opportunities for individualized behavioral interventions to improve semantic memory and improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer's disease. Project Narrative This project examines the mechanisms underlying decline of semantic memory (memory for knowledge) in individuals with Alzheimer's disease by developing and applying novel computational models. This research will develop methods for testing neurocognitive theories of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, inform interventions for mitigating decline, and further our understanding of how the disease spreads.",Computational modeling of semantic decline in Alzheimer's disease,9164777,R21AG053467,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Free Association', 'Huntington Disease', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Semantic memory', 'Semantics', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Work', 'behavioral impairment', 'computerized tools', 'contagion', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'memory retrieval', 'neurocognitive test', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'research study', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2016,206644,-0.043724753005756775
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9185649,R01NS094659,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Sensory Process', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'Work', 'cell type', 'design', 'driving behavior', 'expectation', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'object shape', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'spatial integration', 'targeted treatment']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,350000,0.019566413769669028
"Translating from Rats to Humans: A Human Foraging Model of Decision-Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Animal models of addiction are some of the most highly regarded models of psychopathology.  As a result, treatments for humans are often developed based on animal addiction models.  However, there remains a disconnection between these pre-clinical models and treatment outcomes.  Some researchers suggest that the gap in translating pre-clinical to clinical models stems from untested assumptions that different species recruit the same cognitive substrates on the modeled tasks.  Therefore, there is a need for research than can verify that animal and human decision-making systems are comparable, which in turn, could improve the generalizability of results across these research stages.  Effective translational paradigms are needed to test similarities (or differences) in cognitive processes across species.  The present proposal introduces a novel experiential foraging paradigm for humans, which was designed based on a go/no-go foraging paradigm for rats (Restaurant Row).  In the Restaurant Row paradigm, an animal has a fixed amount of time to traverse a circular track collecting food rewards after variable delay times from different ""restaurants."" This paradigm successfully captured individual differences in preference, as well as behavioral and neural signatures of emotional constructs (e.g.  regret, disappointment).  In the proposed human variant (called the Web-Surf task), humans make a series of go/no-go decisions as they travel between video galleries that present different types of video clips after variable delays.  The human variant was designed to mimic the rat variant while also considering natural human ethology.  Preliminary analyses in human subjects suggest the two paradigms capture similar behavioral mechanisms.  The first aim of the proposed project is to examine whether the Web- Surf task equivalently measures emotional constructs, such as regret.  The first aim also seeks to elucidate whether individual differences in behavioral task performance map onto variations in impulsive traits.  The second aim of the proposed project is to determine whether the Web-Surf task captures neural signatures of deliberation and emotional processing as seen in rats.  This will be accomplished using general linear modeling and machine learning approaches for processing functional neuroimaging data.  This task could be pivotal in reducing the gap between pre-clinical and clinical research, and more importantly, advancing the development of addiction treatments for humans.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Animal models of addiction are some of the most highly regarded models of psychopathology; however, there remains a disconnection between these pre-clinical models and treatment outcomes.  This division may be, in part, due to untested assumptions that different species recruit the same cognitive systems in the compared tasks.  The novel research outlined in this proposal will help improve the translation between human and nonhuman animal models, and in turn, improve treatment efficacy for these disorders.                ",Translating from Rats to Humans: A Human Foraging Model of Decision-Making,9185215,F31DA040335,"['Accounting', 'Advanced Development', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clip', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Ethology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Food', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual Differences', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Linear Models', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Rattus', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regrets', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Restaurants', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Students', 'Substance abuse problem', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analog', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'human subject', 'improved', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'stem', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'willingness']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,F31,2016,36927,0.01780229345839136
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9162788,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,407688,0.024940623991910493
"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9130265,R01MH109180,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,246990,0.011766233839070443
"The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Risky behaviors such as smoking, drug and alcohol use, and teenaged sexual intercourse are all heavily influenced by the behaviors of one's peers. While much is known about the neural networks involved in risky decision-making, this research has largely been conducted in the absence of the rich network of social information available when making risky decisions in real-life. Given the large body of evidence suggesting the importance of information about peers' choices when making risky decisions, it is of great public-health relevance to understand how the integration of this information into the risky decision takes place at the neural level, and, particularly, what differences in processing of this information lead some people to be more susceptible to peer influence than others. The proposed research aims to answer these questions by having a sample of 50 14-19 year olds perform a novel real-stakes social gambling task in the scanner. In this task, participants will make choices about a series of risky gambles, on each trial receiving false information about the decisions of four of their friends who previously completed the task. Using the reported percentage of risk acceptance as a parametric modulator, we will identify regions in the brain where BOLD activation encodes information about others' choice behavior. Second, we will calculate a peer susceptibility score for each subject based on their choices in the task, reflecting how much their choices were swayed by the reported actions of others. We will then use a machine-learning based regression technique to generate a spatial pattern of regression weights that can predict each participant's behavioral susceptibility to peer influence. The strength of these regression weights in different areas of the brain reflects how strongly encoding of others' choices in that region predicts individuals' peer susceptibility scores. These data allow us to: 1) Identify patterns of encoding of others' choice information that are most strongly predictive of being highly susceptible to peer influence, and 2) Generate a neurologic signature that can be used in new samples of participants to predict their level of susceptibility to peer influence. We will then compare predictions of peer susceptibility derived from the brain data to patterns of real-world risk-taking of the participant and their peers. We believe that thes findings can set the stage for future work examining developmental changes in these networks, and how responses in these networks can be altered by exposure to different types of peers or by potential interventions designed to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in specific domains. These avenues of research will allow for the accelerated development of more precise and effective intervention strategies to reduce susceptibility to peer influence in the domain of publi-health relevant risk-taking.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The risky actions of peers strongly influence individuals' risk-taking behavior. This research will examine how information about peers' risky choices are represented in the brain, develop a set of neural markers that can predict the extent to which an individual will be influenced by the actions of their peers, based on their encoding of the peers' choices, and examine relations between these neural markers and susceptibility to peer influence in real-world risk-taking.        ",The Neural Mechanisms of Peer Influence on Risky Decision-Making,9112119,R21HD086375,"['19 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Choice Behavior', 'Coitus', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Divorce', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Punishment', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk-Taking', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Social Environment', 'Social Network', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'cognitive control', 'effective intervention', 'information processing', 'interest', 'member', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'parental involvement', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'social', 'therapy design', 'underage drinking', 'willingness']",NICHD,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2016,228000,-0.0037671724173779144
"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.        ",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9128362,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive process', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2016,827432,-0.01859833028661906
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.",Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction,9097801,R01MH101487,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adjustment Disorders', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Illness impact', 'Incentives', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Functioning', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'disturbance in affect', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'genome wide association study', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'negative mood', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2016,562097,0.008526602670853154
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,9070769,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Health', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,418411,-0.0021430447949496983
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease. The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,9065984,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional control', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computer studies', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2016,400000,0.01077712748974797
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,9132618,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'depression model', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic significance', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'symptomatology', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2016,48332,-0.05687277134965587
"Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Executive control processes are needed to regulate the balance between attending to events in one's external environment and attending to introspective processing, including the reliving of past memories and the associated emotions that they evoke. The proposed studies aim to clarify the neural mechanisms that support these specific forms of cognition and that mediate the ability to flexibly shift attentional resources between them. We are specifically interested in evaluating whether the retrieval of a negatively-valenced autobiographical episode will induce an internally-oriented brain state that may obstructively linger when changing task demands require a shift towards prioritizing the processing of incoming sensory stimuli. Our interests are motivated by recent findings in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), who exhibit a tendency to ruminate about negative past events, difficulty disengaging from these ruminations, and an associated neural system abnormality resulting in an inability to effectively mobilize executive control systems to suppress the internally-oriented default mode network (DMN). This may in turn exert a cost on the performance of goal-directed cognitive operations that depend on monitoring external stimuli and limiting distraction. However, before we can properly characterize these processes in MDD, it is essential that we better understand how the healthy brain enacts executive control to efficiently shift between internally- and externally-focused states, especially in the context of negative affect.  To pursue these goals, we have designed an fMRI task paradigm in which participants are cued to vividly recall a negatively-valenced or neutral autobiographical memory and shortly thereafter are tasked with performing an externally-oriented visual working memory task. Our proposed analyses will monitor brain activity, functional connectivity, and behavior as participants shift back and forth between these two very distinct tasks-one requiring self-reflective mentation and the other requiring continuous stimulus processing and decision-making. By training a multivariate classifier model to identify functional connectivity patterns uniquely associated with each task set, we will be able to track the expression of these connectivity signatures over time. This will allow us to test whether the recollection of negative life events disproportionately impairs one's ability to efficiently reconfigure cortical network dynamics during the transition between tasks. Such metrics could eventually be used to aid in the diagnosis of MDD or the identification of those most prone to relapse. Indeed, given current NIMH priorities for treatment development, using such a endophenotype (Miller & Rockstroh, 2013) as a treatment target may warrant high priority.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to control declarative memory processes is a critical ability in daily life and is a process that appears to be dysfunctional in major depressiv disorder (MDD) patients, who have difficulty breaking away from cycles of negative rumination. Using a novel experimental paradigm and an innovative fMRI analysis approach, we aim to advance understanding of the functioning of these cognitive and neural systems in healthy participants. The future directions of this research will be to apply our fMRI protocol to MDD patients to potentially aid in the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, which is a leading source of disability worldwide.            ",Neurocognitive Mechanisms of the Executive Control of Memory and Emotion,9122745,F31MH110114,"['Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Questionnaires', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'disability', 'distraction', 'emotion regulation', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'memory process', 'negative affect', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'operation', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory stimulus', 'stimulus processing', 'subclinical depression', 'therapy development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2016,35305,0.006545843206313258

"Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD Project Summary  Increasing numbers of children are diagnosed or treated for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), yet its diagnosis and treatment remain controversial, specific etiologies remain uncertain, and clinical prediction is poor. The research and training activities proposed in this K23 application advance the PI's long- term career goal of establishing an independent, translational program of research characterizing individual differences in the psychological, cognitive, and neurobiological processes contributing to ADHD. The proposed training emphasizes skill development in: 1) advanced analysis approaches for electrophysiological data; 2) integrating these analytical approaches in the context of cognitive neuroscience models of attention and working memory for translational work; 3) learning conceptual and practical tools related to identification of developmentally-sensitive, multivariate refined phenotypes; and 4) additional training in research ethics and professional development. Skills are developed through didactic instruction, hands-on experience in data collection and analysis, and intensive mentorship related to the closely-linked research and training aims.  Consensus is emerging that effective measurement of pathophysiological mechanisms is essential for improvement of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments of ADHD. Neurocognitive measures, broadly defined, are seen as particularly promising for understanding mechanisms of ADHD and creating alternative phenotypes. They have also been central to efforts at novel treatment development, for example via computerized cognitive training of working memory and electroencephalogram (EEG)-based neurofeedback. However, data on efficacy of these new treatments remain unconvincing. This is likely, at least in part, because the mechanisms of cognitive control being targeted are not adequately specified or contextualized. In order to move the field forward, at least three issues need to be resolved: 1) the appropriate fractionation of cognitive control deficits needs to be clarified and trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance need to be identified; 2) differences in how control processes are implemented across emotional contexts need to be characterized; and 3) cognitive, emotional, and neurophysiological predictors need to be related to clinical outcomes. EEG measures, including resting and evoked oscillatory activity and evoked response potentials (ERPs) are ideal for these purposes because they provide millisecond-level quantification of the neurophysiological response associated with these psychological processes and thus can help clarify the neurophysiological bases of impairments.  The proposed study applies EEG/ERP methodology to resolve questions related to cognitive and emotional control deficits in a sample of 150 children with and without ADHD, ages 12-16 years, recruited from a larger longitudinal study. Aim 1 tests hypotheses stemming from the adaptive gain theory that ADHD-related deficits in working memory and performance variability result from a common problem in attention optimization and identifies trial-by-trial neurophysiological predictors of performance. Aim 2 integrates the attention dysregulation described in Aim 1 with two novel ADHD emotion-based types previously identified by the PI. Finally, in Aim 3, cognitive and EEG/ERP markers are incorporated in a recursive decision-making algorithm to identify multivariate refined phenotype profiles for each emotion-based ADHD type. The potential impact of this work over time would be to help sharpen psychiatric nosology and provide improved clinical diagnosis, characterization, and prediction. Ultimately, there is the potential to move psychology and psychiatry toward personalized approaches to treatment and spur novel treatment development. Project Narrative  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common, chronic, and impairing condition of childhood whose diagnosis and treatment remain controversial. The current project seeks to clarify the cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological mechanisms at play for children with ADHD. It is hoped the results will help to improve diagnostic practices and inform development of new treatments.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of cognitive and emotional control in ADHD,9177860,K23MH108656,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Contingent Negative Variation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dissociation', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Performance at work', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Reaction Time', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skills Development', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'computerized', 'disease classification', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'millisecond', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurofeedback', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'positive emotional state', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'response', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'stem', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,180850,-0.012457979530838244
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,9124921,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'dynamic system', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2016,504474,-0.04584457404494
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9131824,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2016,492125,0.0334216462770949
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,9098854,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2016,248999,-0.04151485741888708
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,9098673,R01DA038891,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Vertebrates', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'data management', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject protection', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,326999,0.01354445277357879
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health.

"CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Overview: Among the most celebrated success stories in computational neuroscience is the discovery that many aspects of decision-making can be understood in terms of the formal framework of reinforcement learning (RL). Ideas drawn from RL have shed light on many behavioral phenomena in learning and action selection, on the functional anatomy and neural processes underlying reward-driven behavior, and on fundamental aspects of neuromodulatory function. However, for all these successes, RL-based work is haunted by an inconvenient truth: Standard RL algorithms scale poorly to large, complex problems. If human learning and decision-making are driven by RL-like mechanisms, how is it that we cope with the kinds of rich, large-scale tasks that are typical of everyday life? Existing research in both psychology and neuroscience hints at one answer to this question: Complex problems can be conquered if the decision-maker is equipped with compact, intelligently formatted representations of the task. This principle is seen in studies of expert play in chess, which show that chess masters leverage highly integrative internal representations of board configurations; in studies of frontal and parietal lobe function, which have revealed receptive fields strongly shaped by task contingencies; and studies on the hippocampus, which point to the role of this structure in supporting a hierarchically organized 'cognitive map,' of task space. Not coincidentally, the critical role of representation has come increasingly to the fore in RL-based research in machine learning and robotics, with growing interest in techniques for dimensionality reduction, hierarchy and deep learning.            The present project aims toward a systematic, empirically validated account of the role of representation in supporting RL and goal-directed behavior at large. The project brings together three investigators with complementary expertise in cognitive and computational neuroscience (Botvinick, Gershman) and machine learning and robotics (Konidaris). Together, we propose an integrative, interdisciplinary program of research, applying behavioral and neuroimaging work with human subjects, computational modeling of neurophysiological and behavioral data, formal mathematical work and simulations with artificial agents. The proposed studies are diverse in theme and method, but work together toward a theory that is both formally grounded and empirically constrained. At a more concrete level, our research focuses on four specific classes of representation, considering the computational impact of each for RL, as well as the relevance of each to neuroscience and human behavior. As detailed in our Project Description, these include (1) metric embedding, (2) spectral decomposition, (3) hierarchical representation and (4) symbolic representation. In addition to investigating the implications of each of these four forms of representation individually, we hypothesize that they fit together into a tiered system, which works as a whole to support the sometimes competing demands of learning and action control.         Intellectual Merit (provided by applicant): Understanding how representational structure impacts learning and decision making is a core challenge in cognitive science, behavioral neuroscience and, artificial intelligence. Success in establishing a computationally explicit, empirically validated theory in this area, with a specific focus on the role of representation in R, would represent an important achievement with wide repercussions. The strategy of leveraging conceptual tools from machine learning to investigate human behavior and brain function can offer considerable scientific leverage, as our own previous research illustrates. The proposed work is motivated by and builds upon established lines of research, bringing these together in order to capitalize on opportunities for synergy. In addition to answering specific empirical and computational questions, the proposed work aims to open up new avenues for future research in an important area of inquiry.         Broader Impact (provided by applicant): The proposed work lies at the crossroads of neuroscience, psychology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and promises to advance the growing exchange among these fields. The project brings together investigators with contrasting disciplinary affiliations, with the explicit goal of bridging between intellectual cultres. The proposed work is likely to find a wide scientific audience, given its relevance to cognitive and developmental psychology, behavioral, cognitive and systems neuroscience, and behavioral economics. However, the work is likely to be of equal interest within artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics, where a current challenge is precisely to understand how representation learning can allow RL to scale up to large problems. Representational approaches to RL are already of intense interest within industry, where the present investigators have a record of active engagement. The topic of the proposed work has applicability in other areas as well, including education and training, and military and medical decision support. The plan for the project has a robust training component at both graduate and postdoctoral levels, with a commitment to fostering involvement of underrepresented minorities, as well as international engagement.                 n/a",CRCNS: Representational foundations of adaptive behavior in natural and artificial ,9052441,R01MH109177,"['Accounting', 'Achievement', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Industry', 'International', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral economics', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive system', 'computational neuroscience', 'coping', 'developmental psychology', 'driving behavior', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'programs', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,425468,0.029381079237213885
"CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY The essence of cognition is choice, and to understand choice we need to understand the brain mechanisms that guide decisions in complex settings. These mechanisms are implemented through interactions of large neural networks across cortical and subcortical areas. Tracking population response dynamics on single trials and relating them to internal cognitive states and overt behavior are critical for incisive tests of current models of decision-making. Here we propose to characterize the activity patterns of large populations of neurons (100+) in the prefrontal cortex of macaque monkeys engaged in decision-making tasks. We will explain the spatiotemporal patterns of activation in the population by developing the most parsimonious probabilistic model that takes into account pairwise and higher-order interactions of neurons. The model will be utilized to characterize response manifolds of the network and quantify its dynamics in different task epochs. Our approach is unique because rather than trying to embed the population dynamics in a low dimensional manifold using Machine Learning tools, we propose to extend the Maximum Entropy framework to directly capture the high-dimensional dynamics. Further, by characterizing functional dependencies among cells we can map the architecture and design of large networks in terms of subnetwork motifs and computations. Finally, we will investigate how noisy fluctuations of responses or artificial manipulation of network activity influences its dynamics and modifies or disturbs its computations. Scrutinizing the results of these experiments within our modeling framework makes headway toward addressing long-standing questions about decision-making, including the neural basis of psychological models and effects of initial state on the behavior.  Our work will have broader impacts in two domains. First, the path that we will chart for discovering functional subnetworks and their computations will be useable in various subfields of neuroscience. We will significantly advance data analysis and computational modeling tools available to neuroscientists and, therefore, will facilitate future studies of normal mental functions and mental disorders using high-dimensional neural data. Second, characterizing information encoding and response dynamics in the prefrontal cortex sheds light on mechanisms of decision-making and emergence of cognitive abilities in complex neural networks. Deficits of decision-making are at the heart of a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease. Several behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been proposed for those deficits, but we lack a clear understanding of how they work at the level of neuronal systems. To develop the next generation of therapies, we need to understand how cognitive processes emerge across multiple functional levels, from individual neurons to networks of brain areas. Our work is a step in that direction. It has the potential to advance our understanding of pathology of mental disorders and help with the discovery of better treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to develop a computational framework that accurately captures response dynamics of a population of prefrontal neurons during decision-making. We will simultaneously measure and manipulate the activity of one hundred or more prefrontal neurons and develop computational models that explain the response dynamics of the prefrontal network. Our study will facilitate a better understanding of the decision-making process, which is impaired in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's disease.",CRCNS:  Neural coding and computation in large ensembles in prefrontal cortex,9052858,R01MH109180,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dependency', 'Electrodes', 'Entropy', 'Experimental Models', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological Models', 'Reporting', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'association cortex', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive process', 'computer framework', 'design', 'insight', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'next generation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,213460,0.011766233839070443
"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.

"Shifting auditory spatial attention: cognitive and neural mechanisms ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hearing can serve as an early warning system because it can panoramically monitor the environment for events happening at a distance or out of sight. These ecological considerations make the auditory system particularly useful for studying mechanisms for shifting spatial attention. The focus of this project is on the interplay between top-down and bottom-up spatial attention biases that govern shifting auditory attention to distractors during performance of a simple spatial attention task. The overall goal of this proposal is to use an interdisciplinary approach to better understand at the cognitive and neural levels of analysis how auditory attention is distributed over space. We will test the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of auditory attentional emerges from interactions among two basic factors. The first factor is a voluntary (top-down) attention bias that weakens with distance from the current focus of attention. Conversely, the second factor is an automatic (bottom-up) bias that is tuned to shift attention to unexpected events away from the current focus of attention. The first aim tests a computational model of top-down and bottom-up attention bias in shifting auditory spatial attention. Different aspects of the model will be quantitatively tested against findings from behavioral experiments, and observations will be used to further develop the model. The computational model will incorporate artificial intelligence methods to represent human cognitive processes. The second aim uses transcranial magnetic stimulation to test the role of key right hemisphere cortical areas in shifting of auditory spatial attention. We focus on neural mechanisms of bottom-up attentional bias. The third aim tests whether auditory attention gradients become less focused over time. This will determine how gradients relate to cognitive resources and neural blood flow measures that are known to decline with extended vigilance. This project will help advance knowledge in the field of auditory attention and cognitive hearing, and also addresses general issues in attention research such as top-down and bottom-up processes, vigilance, and their relations to neurobiological attention networks. Outcomes will have practical significance because shifting auditory attention is vital for avoiding accidents at ll ages, maintaining independent living at older ages, and is applicable to neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project outcomes could have clinical in neurological and psychiatric disorders having attentional impairments (e.g. PTSD, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, stroke, dementia).

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction.

"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The processing of negative information and its often deleterious impact on behavior has been extensively investigated. Importantly, how the brain processes negative information is thought to be centrally linked to the psychopathologies of depression and the anxiety disorders. The processing of positive information, say as manipulated via reward, also has been extensively studied. In this case, how the brain processes positive information is thought to be centrally linked to drug abuse and addiction. Although a lot is known about the systems involved in processing negative and positive information, we are only starting to make progress in understanding how they simultaneously act in the brain and thus influence ""normal"" and clinically relevant behaviors. Filling this gap is important because in many real-world situations both negative and positive systems simultaneously contribute to behaviors. From a clinical standpoint, for example, in depression both systems likely play important roles. The objective of the present application is to advance our understanding of the interactions between negative and positive information processing in the brain and their impact on behavior. Critical questions that will be investigated include: do negative and positive systems interact always antagonistically as often assumed following classical theories of opponent processing? Under what conditions, if any, do they interact synergistically? What is the role of context, say as determined by which information is task relevant, in shaping the interactions between negative and positive systems? Across two aims, we will test whether the interactions between negative and positive processing are antagonistic vs. cooperative. Aim 1 will investigate interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""punctual"" (e.g., an aversive image or a CS+ stimulus presented at a specific point in time). Both the impact of negative information on reward processing and the impact of reward on the processing of aversive stimuli will be investigated. Aim 2 will investigate the interactions between negative and positive processing when aversive information is ""state"" like (e.g., aversive events linked to prolonged situations in which aversive events may occur; say, tens of seconds to minutes). Collectively, we expect to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the interactions between negative and positive processing in the brain, and make important new contributions to cognitive/affective neuroscience that have the potential to be of clinical relevance.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this proposal is to advance our understanding of how negative emotion and motivational processing interact in the human brain and their impact on behavior.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease. The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8856663,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional control', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinically significant', 'computer studies', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2015,400000,0.01077712748974797
"Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): [Depression is a common disorder with a major public health impact.] Recent research has linked [depression with abnormal function] in the default-mode network (DMN), a network of regions that is typically active at rest, and deactivates during cognitive tasks. [Depression has been linked with increased DMN connectivity] during resting-state fMRI, and a relative failure to suppress DMN when individuals view negative images. In addition, depressed individuals demonstrate enhanced and prolonged amygdala responses to negative images. [This has led to the theory that DMN abnormalities might interfere with recruitment of brain regions to regulate amygdala in depressed individuals.] [These neural markers in depressed individuals have also been related to brooding rumination, a type of maladaptive coping involving repetitive negative thoughts.] This work proposes to test this model using cross-modal comparison of fMRI data in individuals during a resting-state scan and while participants are viewing negative images. Two main hypotheses will be tested: 1) resting-state DMN [function] will predict decreased top-down regulation of emotion during viewing of negative images, and 2) increased resting-state DMN [function], and decreased top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing, will be predicted by increased trait [brooding]. Assessment of top-down emotion regulation during negative-image-viewing will be multimodal and will focus on the time period 6-12s after image offset, capturing ""recovery"" from the negative image, while controlling for initial 6 s of activity in response to the image (""reactivity""). Measures will include amygdala activity, amygdala-prefrontal connectivity, and electromyography of the corrugator supercilii, a muscle that is a reliable indicator of the experience of negative emotion. [In addition, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) will be used to classify negative vs. neutral images as an alternative measure of neural responses.] DMN [function] will be assessed in two ways. First, functional connectivity between two major nodes of the DMN (medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex) will be calculated using correlation-based methods. Second, [a metric of DMN dominance over a cognitive control network will be calculated following methods used previously by other researchers. In order to assess how resting-state DMN function predicts top-down emotion regulation, these DMN metrics will be regressed onto all of the above metrics of emotion regulation. In order to assess how these measures correspond to trait brooding, brooding will be assessed using a standardized measure (the Ruminative Responses Scale; RRS) [and also regressed onto the outcome measures above]. This work will elucidate the relationship of DMN activity, [neural correlates of] emotion regulation and [brooding] with implications for risk and treatment of affective disorders.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Depression is a common and devastating disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, but its cognitive and neural bases remain incompletely understood. The proposed study will assess a neurocognitive model of [depression] by modeling fMRI BOLD activity while participants are resting and also while they regulate emotion during a task, allowing us to make cross-modal comparisons of neural activity. [We will additionally assess individual differences in trait brooding, an important risk factor for depression.] Using these data, we will be able to explicate critical hypotheses about the neural basis of depression and its associations with emotional style and emotion regulation, which in turn will afford us further insights relevant to understanding mechanisms of risk and treatment for affective psychopathology.                ",Resting State and Task-Evoked Neural Bases of Rumination and Affective Dysfunction,8978161,F30MH106191,"['Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Electromyography', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Muscle', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive task', 'coping', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional adjustment', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'mortality', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standardize measure', 'success', 'theories', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F30,2015,33015,-0.05687277134965587
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.          ",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9029452,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2015,507375,0.0334216462770949
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8897409,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,521457,-0.04584457404494
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8898252,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory input', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2015,249000,-0.04151485741888708
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.     What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.     What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented.         Protections for Human Subjects:    Acceptable        Vertebrate Animals:    Not applicable        Resource Sharing:    Acceptable. Data management plan is reasonable. Published data will be shared upon request when practically and ethically possible.        Budget and Period of Support:    Recommend as Requested Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,8926934,R01DA038891,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Vertebrates', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'data management', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject protection', 'improved', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,329880,0.01354445277357879
"Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Psychiatric disorders, as well as normal aging, are often associated with a wide range of cognitive changes. Recent developments in neuroscience, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, can provide better understanding of neural mechanisms that underlie these changes. Mediation analysis is a popularly used statistical method to investigate neural mechanisms. However, existing statistical methods were not designed to accommodate such large-scale, multi-dimensional, and complicated data in mediation analysis. The overarching aim of my K01 Mentored Research Development Award is to acquire training that will allow me to pursue a line of mental health research related to cognition and to develop novel statistical methods to support the emerging research in cognitive neuroimaging and mental health. I propose to receive training in: 1) cognition and its relationship with aging and psychopathology; 2) neural basis in cognition and multimodal neuroimaging; 3) functional mediation and selective mediation analysis. This will provide me with the tools to conduct research that will fill significant gaps in the statistical analyses on cognitive neuroimaging, particularly focusing on aging and neurodegeneration-associated cognitive decline: First, I propose to review and develop analytic tools to examine how aging and psychopathology affect cognitive system constructs. Understanding the patterns of age-related differences in each of these cognitive constructs and the possible heterogeneity related to the psychopathology is of great importance. I will test nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the latent cognitive constructs using two independent large data. Second, I will develop and examine activation networks (reference ability neural networks (RANNs)) associated with each of the cognitive constructs. Although it is critical to understand underlying neural networks of cognition, there are many unsolved problems in investigating the presence or structure of RANNs. I will develop a method to derive underlying networks, find RANNs taking into account possible spatial overlap among RANNs, and investigate the relationship between RANNs expression and performance on the concomitant cognitive constructs. Third, I will develop selective mediation analyses to examine the relationship between imaged neural substrates of aging and psychiatric disorder, such as regional volume loss, and cognitive decline and test if the different imaged brain modalities selectively mediate cognitive aging by influencing the expression of cognitive ability constructs. In totality, this training and research will inform hypotheses for an R01 grant application to be submitted in Year 4 of the award period. While to date I have exemplified a productive research career in biostatistics and psychiatry, I need substantially more training for successful completion of the research proposed in this application and to make a lasting contribution to the field of mental health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present application develops new statistical methods to examine neural mechanisms in the context of cognitive system constructs. The training and research proposed here will form the basis for developing a new line of statistical methods to identify functional neural mechanisms related to cognitive constructs and examine the role of brain in cognitive changes associated with psychiatric disorders. These inquires have substantial promise for mental health; accurate identification of functional and structural neural system and their mechanisms is crucial to better understanding mental illness and developing new treatments.             ",Statistical Methods for Neural Mechanisms Mediating Cognitive System in Mental Health Research,8951241,K01AG051348,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Applications Grants', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'age effect', 'age related', 'base', 'brain volume', 'career', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'design', 'method development', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'pathological aging', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'tool']",NIA,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,K01,2015,131400,-3.283104616616054e-05
"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness.

"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,8710346,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,418570,-0.0021430447949496983
"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.          The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                 ",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8686083,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2014,400000,0.01077712748974797

Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8711519,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional RNA', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2014,480422,-0.04584457404494
"CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): What aspects of previous experiences guide decisions? Much research concerns how the brain computes the average, over many experiences, of rewards received for an option. But such a summary - produced by prominent models of dopaminergic incremental learning- is chiefly useful for repetitive tasks. Much less is understood about how the brain can flexibly evaluate new or changing options in more realistic tasks, which must rely on less aggregated information. This application argues that this is fundamentally a function of memory, so this project looks to the brain's memories for the most individuated experiences - episodes - to seek new computational, cognitive and neural mechanisms that could support more flexible decisions. The overarching hypothesis is that episodic memory, supported by the hippocampus, plays a central role in guiding flexible decision making and complements the wellknown role of dopaminergic and striatal systems in incremental learning of value.  What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity? By connecting the computational neuroscience of decision making with the cognitive neuroscience of memory, and bringing together collaborators from each area, this project promises to shed light on both areas. This is because the neural mechanisms supporting episodic memory are well studied, but less so their contribution to adaptive behavior. Computationally, episodic memories can support a family of learning algorithms that draw on sparse, individual experiences, such as Monte Carlo and kernel methods. These suggest novel, plausible hypotheses for how the brain solves more realistic decision problems, and in particular how it implements ""goal-directed"" or ""model-based"" choices. The proposed studies aim to differentiate the contributions of incremental and episodic learning to value-based decisions, and test to what extent episodic memories contribute to decisions previously identified as model-based. Our hypotheses are tested fitting computational models to neural activity from functional MRI experiments in humans, and also to choice behavior in healthy individuals compared to patients with isolated damage to specific neural systems. This combination of computational, neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches permits finely tracing the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning as reflected both in brain activity nd behavior, and also testing the causal role of particular brain regions in these same processes.  What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity? A striking range of psychiatric and neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and eating disorders, are accompanied by aberrant decision-making and by dysfunction in circuitry central to this proposal, such as striatal and fronto-temporal mechanisms. But understanding such dysfunction requires a better understanding of how each of these circuits separately influences decisions. A focus on untangling multiple decision systems is particularly pertinent to disorders such as drug abuse, which is hypothesized to center on the compromise of incremental reinforcement mechanisms that may support more habitual actions and underlie the compulsive nature of such diseases. At the same time, drugs may also weaken or compromise more deliberative or goal-directed choice systems that might otherwise be able to support more advantageous decisions. Formally understanding the roles played by both of these influences, and how they interact, promises to improve the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of these and other disorders. The proposed program also provides unique opportunities for training and education. By integrating multiple core tools of systems and cognitive neuroscience (computational modeling, functional imaging, patient studies, behavioral analyses), students in the labs of both PIs are trained in different approaches to a unified research question, preparing them to be effective scientists in a more interdisciplinary future. Components of this training will also be extended to undergraduate and high school student populations through existing programs at both NYU and at Columbia and through outreach to New York area schools. This project will also help promote broader representation of minorities in science, including women. As a female neuroscientist with many women trainees in her laboratory, PI Shohamy serves as a role model and the collaborative project facilitates training for women in computational neuroscience, an area in which women are particularly underrepresented. Drug abuse is acquired through learning. Much research focuses on the involvement of dopaminergic  incremental learning processes. But other learning and memory systems are likely to also contribute to  aspects, such as drug-seeking, not well explained by those mechanisms. By isolating the contribution of  different memory systems to learned choice, this project may help to guide future treatment strategies.",CRCNS: Computational and neural mechanisms of memory-guided decisions,8837113,R01DA038891,"['Accounting', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Choice Behavior', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Drug abuse', 'Eating Disorders', 'Employee Strikes', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Female', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Midbrain structure', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Nature', 'Neuropsychology', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Woman', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'dopamine system', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'outreach', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'role model', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,347054,0.012910809502713968
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8892350,R00NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'biophysical properties', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory system', 'signal processing', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R00,2014,249000,-0.04151485741888708
"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence. This in turn could advantageously reduce costs to the healthcare and criminal justice systems.                ",Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence,8782905,F32DA036959,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amphetamine Dependence', 'Amphetamines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attenuated', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Belief', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Criminal Justice', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'System', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2014,53282,-0.016510836330072564
"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.

"Machine learning discovery of patterns of self regulation in drug addiction and I    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is written in response to the RFA on Basic Research on Self-Regulation (RFA-AG-11-010). Disorders where poor self-regulation is a prominent feature involve great harm and pose a serious concern to public health, yet little is known about their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. A series of brain-behavior studies at our laboratory brought forth an empirically based theoretical model of human drug addiction, characterized by Impaired Response Inhibition (RI) and Salience Attribution (SA) (hence, I-RISA). The model posits that addiction involves assigning a lower importance (salience) to non-drug emotional stimuli (while over-valuing drug-related stimuli) with a concomitant compromise in inhibiting disadvantageous responses (e.g., compulsive drug-taking). Neuroimaging mapped these I-RISA components onto dysfunctional striatal- prefrontal cortical circuitry demonstrating the diathesis for impaired self-regulation in this disorder. In the current proposal we will test the I-RISA model in another externalizing psychopathology characterized by impaired self-regulation. Specifically, we will target Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), that similarly to addiction, is a chronic and relapsing disorder, featuring a skewed SA and disrupted RI (individuals with IED perceive provocation where none may have been intended, reacting with disproportionate anger that intermittently culminates in assault behavior and damage to property). In both disorders, we will target sensitive brain-behavior measures of self-regulation, using the theory-informed multidimensional datasets to develop novel computer science algorithms to conduct group classification (distinguishing between cocaine addicted individuals, IED, and healthy controls). This project represents a major departure from the current functional neuroimaging and mental health research paradigms in its focus on: (1) abstract reinforcement with money (a universal secondary reinforcer that acquires its value and uniquely impacts human emotional learning and self- control through social communication); (2) positive but also negative reinforcement (going beyond the reward principle to study compromised sensitivity to punishment and adversity); using both to predict (3) self- regulation during neuroimaging (going beyond self-report as further bolstered by psychophysiological measures); and (4) the multimodal platform to automatically perform group classification (and other machine- learning techniques, e.g., multitask) such that the common neurobehavioral signatures (but also discriminative properties) of impaired self-regulation can be identified, a prototype to be generalized to other disorders of self- regulation. The size of the potentially impacted community is of significant proportions: according to current estimates, up to 20% of the adult population in the U.S. suffers from psychiatric symptoms that impair ability to exercise self-regulation. Bringing forth significant gains toward the goal of liberating patients from the cycle of relapsing behaviors (drug use or assault behaviors) that bear catastrophic consequences to the patients themselves and with devastating costs to the broader society, this tool is estimated to be of great value.        In the current scientific endeavor we apply a well developed theoretical model to the study of the neurobiological underpinning of self-regulation in drug addicted individuals and those with Intermittent Explosive Disorder. In this functional neuroimaging research we will shift the research focus to abstract positive and negative reinforcers (emotional stimuli used to change behavior) and use sophisticated computer science algorithms to predict self-control. Thereby, integrating multimodal and cutting-edge behavioral and brain experimentation and analyses in humans, we will explore common signatures of disrupted self-regulation in two disorders of the most pressing public health concern.

"Automated Web-Based Behavioral Diagnostics of Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade. A critical goal of Alzheimer's disease research is to improve current methods of diagnosis so that patients can be identified sooner and, therefore, obtain greater advantage from available therapies. The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based method for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. We will build on current research that has demonstrated a clear link between performance on the Visual Paired- Comparison Task (VPC) and diagnosis of MCI, and we will extend the impact of this finding by developing a suite of software tools and analysis methods that will improve the accuracy and extend the accessibility of cognitive diagnostics with a web-based VPC task that can be widely deployed. Although the VPC task is promising as a diagnostic aid, clinical application is severely limited by the need to use an eye tracker to precisely monitor subjects' eye movements. Unfortunately, eye trackers are expensive, require trained personnel, and are not widely available. However, our preliminary findings show that it is possible to produce picture examination behavior that is similar to eye-movements, using modified versions of the VPC task that could be administered by anyone, on any computer with an internet connection. In addition, powerful machine learning techniques from computer science can help accurately analyze and diagnose the resulting behavior. An important contribution from this work will be the possibility of predicting oncoming cognitive decline in MCI patients sooner than is now possible, that is, at a time when the nervous system is less compromised and more likely to benefit from therapeutic intervention. In support of this objective, we propose three aims: 1) Develop and investigate appropriate representation of eye movement characteristics and corresponding machine learning-based classification techniques for effective identification of the patient status, 2) Develop and validate a web-based version of the VPC task, and 3) explore the feasibility of our task as an automatic screening instrument for the general elderly population. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable thousands and potentially millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.        Alzheimer's disease affects an estimated 5.3 million Americans currently, and this number is expected to grow significantly in the coming decade.

The major goal of this project is to develop and validate an automated, web-based, and widely accessible behavioral screening test for early diagnosis of cognitive decline and memory loss. Successful completion of this project has the potential to dramatically alter the current practice of clinical translational research as well as the current methods used for diagnosing cognitive deficits. This would enable millions of patients and potential research subjects to take the test as part of their routine checkup, requiring nothing more than a computer with an internet connection.

"Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Integration of dimensional parameters from brain, performance, and self and other-report measures is key towards refining intermediate phenotypes (IPs) within the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) proposal by NIMH. Currently, IPs do not align well with the disjunctive categorical diagnostic systems. In reality, the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar Disorder (BD) NOS and subthreshold conditions have significant overlap in symptoms and impact. There are likely shared disruptions in cognitive and affective systems (IPs) that may confer risk for these disruptions in negative mood. IPs link genes to brain biology and physiology; IPs also link to subsets of different mood disorder groups. The proposal is a synergistic, integrated and applied series of investigations of core domains in any mood disorders (AMD) for 120 individuals, in remission to diminish state symptom confounds, including all BD, MDD, Mood Disorder, NOS, Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood, and subthreshold Mood groups. These AMD subjects will be combined with a healthy control (HC) group of 55 individuals. Domains of the RDoC matrix are measured using self-other- report, other/clinician report, lab-based performance, and brain physiology/circuit (fMRI) biomarker measures to address two Aims and two Exploratory Aims. Scale development tools are used to demonstrate scale reliability and construct validity. Advanced modeling and stratification techniques from biomedical engineering and statistical machine learning will identify across-diagnosis subgroups that share core dimensions of dysfunction, which can be linked to domain and subdomain abnormalities and impact of illness. Aim 1 studies core (shared) dysfunction in elevated Fear to Acute Threat (1.1) using anxiety measures/Neuroticism facets, emotion processing biases, amygdala and limbic reactivity to negative faces in the Emotion Faces Matching Task, and functional connectivity approaches. There is also a core dysfunction in Loss and Loss anticipation (1.2) using negative environmental loss/stresses, negative memory biases, and NAcc and OFC activation to anticipation of loss in the Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) task, and functional connectivity approaches. Aim 2 studies core dysfunction in four Cognitive System subdomains, Attention (2.1), Working Memory (2.2), Cognitive Control (Inhibition, 2.3), and Cognitive Control (Interference, 2.4) measured with self and observer reports, performance, and VL and DLPFC and DACC activation in the N-Back and Parametric Go/No-go/Stop tasks during fMRI. An Exploratory Aim in subdomain stability is conducted in 40 AMD stratified on functional outcome plus 20 HC. Exploratory Aim 2 is collection of blood for later targeted gene experiments and/or sharing in larger GWAS studies. In summary, the present proposal uses dimensional modeling anchored in core features of dysfunction across AMD spectrum, but also pursues areas of differentiation based upon diagnosis, domain and functioning. Our strategy is optimal for the study of RDoC dimensional approaches for classification of AMD spectrum by integrating and extending the existing knowledge base, and integrating with commonly used clinical tools and genetic studies for ready translation of novel findings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Dimensional modeling is a new strategy for helping to resolve how genetics and brain function can be so disparate from current categories of psychiatric illness. The present project uses multimodal, dimensional assessment to capture and subtype, core features across diagnoses, and differentiating biomarkers in all mood disorders, including bipolar, major depressive, mood disorder, adjustment, subthreshold, and NOS categories. Use of these groups and measures from Cognitive and Negative Valence systems provide a full continuum of dimensional data for across modality evaluation of linear, dimensional relationships and determination of construct validity.                ",Dimensional RDoC Modeling across the Range of Negative Mood Dysfunction,8573671,R01MH101487,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adjustment Disorders', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Control Groups', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Illness impact', 'Incentives', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Functioning', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'disturbance in affect', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'genome wide association study', 'instrument', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'negative mood', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'research study', 'response', 'social', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2013,627944,0.008526602670853154
"Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) play central roles in learning and motivation. In tasks involving rewards, they respond in a stereotyped fashion. They are activated by unpredicted rewards. But when a sensory cue predicts reward, they instead start responding to the cue, while their response to reward attenuates. Moreover, when a predicted reward is omitted, their activity is transiently suppressed. From these observations, it has been postulated that dopamine neurons signal discrepancies between expected and actual reward, i.e., they compute the reward prediction error (RPE). However, it remains unknown how dopamine neurons compute RPE. To understand this question, it is important to know (1) what mechanisms suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected, and (2) what mechanisms are responsible for generating the response of dopamine neurons to reward-predicting cues. A previous study in our laboratory has shown that VTA GABA neurons exhibit sustained activations during the delay between a reward-predictive cue and reward. This result suggests that VTA GABA neurons suppress dopamine neurons' responses to reward when the reward is expected. In this proposal, to test this idea experimentally, the sustained activity of VTA GABA neurons will be optogenetically manipulated, and how this manipulation affects dopamine neurons' responses to reward will be examined electrophysiologically. Second, although previous studies have shown that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and the ventral pallidum(VP) provide large numbers of inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons, and NAc neurons project to VP, the exact roles of these connections in regulating the activity of dopamine neurons remain unclear. In a preliminary experiment, inactivation of unilateral NAc was found to greatly reduce dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. We will experimentally test the hypothesis that a disynaptic, inhibitory pathway from NAc to VP to dopamine neurons is responsible in generating dopamine neurons' responses to reward-predictive cues. In total, this project aims to experimentally test the aforementioned specific hypotheses using integrative approaches in mice. Malfunctions of the dopamine system are associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. By providing a detailed, circuit-level analysis of dopamine neuron firing, we will provide a framework for understanding how the brain learns from rewards, and how this system can be disrupted in disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malfunction of the midbrain dopamine system is associated with a variety of pathological conditions including depression, schizophrenia and addiction. Understanding neural circuits that regulate dopamine neurons will deepen our understanding of the etiology of these diseases and aid in the design of preventive and therapeutic approaches.            ",Experimental examinations of the mechanisms that generate the responses of midbra,8558913,R01MH101207,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agonist', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Cues', 'Disease', 'Disinhibition', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Midbrain structure', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Muscimol', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Odors', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Preventive', 'Rabies virus', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stereotyping', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'addiction', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'foot', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'optogenetics', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'theories']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,413444,-0.0021430447949496983
"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.          The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                 ",Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms,8473286,R01MH098039,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognitive', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Eye Movements', 'Family', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Organism', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Perception', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Rattus', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Visual attention', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'attentional modulation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'directed attention', 'discounting', 'expectation', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal eye fields', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lateral intraparietal area', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'oculomotor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'selective attention', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2013,384000,0.01077712748974797
"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.                ",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8452565,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional RNA', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2013,571955,-0.04584457404494
"Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   In the mammalian brain, cortical disengagement from sensory processing is observed at multiple spatial and temporal scales. During active behavior, this process may alter routing of information relevant to selective attention, while during quiescence, it may be relevant for sleep stability and memory consolidation. Several lines of evidence suggest that cortical disengagement is mediated by thalamo-cortical dynamics, including spindle oscillations. Spindles are discrete 7- 15Hz cortical oscillations linked to activty of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a group of GABAergic cells surround the dorsal thalamus. Attenuated spindles are observed in schizophrenia, and may contribute to the sensory gating deficits observed in this disorder, while hypersynchronous spindles are thought to represent spike and wave discharges (SWDs) of absence epilepsy; the inappropriate expression of sensory disengagement during active waking. Despite their discovery seven decades ago, the basic phenomenology of spindles is undergoing major revision. While surface electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in humans and local field potential (LFP) recordings in anesthetized animals have shown spindles to be coherent across cortical areas, recent human magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and implanted electrode recordings have revealed local expression of these events, suggesting that spindles have a local computational value linked to their roles in sensory filtering and memory. Using newly developed light-weight multi-electrode microdrives, I will record and manipulate electrophysiological activity across multiple sectors of the TRN in freely behaving mice. I will first refine an optogenetic approach that I have been using to determine the parameters under which local, modality-specific, control of TRN and related neocortex can be controlled (Aim I). In Aim II, I will use these parameters to causally control spindle generation and explore whether spindle type is dependent on the locus of TRN induction. In Aim III, I will test whether spindle expression attenuates sensory input in a modality-specific manner using somatosensory stimulation. These aims will directly test an important hypothesis about spindle expression and function, leading to greater insight into the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and absence seizures. In addition, insight into the principles by which thalamic firing modes contribute to routing of sensory information will be relevant to designing neural prosthetics for augmenting sensory function and cognition. Importantly, this proposal will allow me to learn optogenetic, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques in mice, under the mentorship of Drs. Christopher Moore and Matthew Wilson. I will learn statistical and analytic techniques under the mentorship of Dr. Emery Brown. My future career goal is to combine my clinical experience with rodent studies to lead a translational research program that transcends species boundaries. I will use the human model to look for electrophysiological endophenotypes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and the rodent model to perform circuit-level dissection of these processes under physiological conditions and in models of disease. This project will investigate how a certain type of cortical oscillation, spindles, are generated by thalamic mechanisms, and what functional significance their expression has on sleep and sensory function. Spindles are thought to be important for sleep stability, sensory filtering during sleep and sleep-dependent memory consolidation. Attenuated spindles are thought to contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, while excess spindles underlie the generation of spike and wave discharges of absence seizures. The proposed research, therefore, will have broad implications in understanding disease mechanisms and approach to rational correction.",Causal examination of TRN role in neocortical spindle generation and function,8424238,K99NS078115,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Astrocytes', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dissection', 'Dorsal', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'In Vitro', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Process', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'career', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'genetic manipulation', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'light weight', 'neocortical', 'neural prosthesis', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'post-doctoral training', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'role model', 'selective attention', 'sensory gating', 'sensory system', 'sleep regulation', 'somatosensory', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'transmission process']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2013,90662,-0.04151485741888708
"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology.

"Machine learning discovery of patterns of self regulation in drug addiction and I    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is written in response to the RFA on Basic Research on Self-Regulation (RFA-AG-11-010). Disorders where poor self-regulation is a prominent feature involve great harm and pose a serious concern to public health, yet little is known about their underlying neurobiological mechanisms. A series of brain-behavior studies at our laboratory brought forth an empirically based theoretical model of human drug addiction, characterized by Impaired Response Inhibition (RI) and Salience Attribution (SA) (hence, I-RISA). The model posits that addiction involves assigning a lower importance (salience) to non-drug emotional stimuli (while over-valuing drug-related stimuli) with a concomitant compromise in inhibiting disadvantageous responses (e.g., compulsive drug-taking). Neuroimaging mapped these I-RISA components onto dysfunctional striatal- prefrontal cortical circuitry demonstrating the diathesis for impaired self-regulation in this disorder. In the current proposal we will test the I-RISA model in another externalizing psychopathology characterized by impaired self-regulation. Specifically, we will target Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), that similarly to addiction, is a chronic and relapsing disorder, featuring a skewed SA and disrupted RI (individuals with IED perceive provocation where none may have been intended, reacting with disproportionate anger that intermittently culminates in assault behavior and damage to property). In both disorders, we will target sensitive brain-behavior measures of self-regulation, using the theory-informed multidimensional datasets to develop novel computer science algorithms to conduct group classification (distinguishing between cocaine addicted individuals, IED, and healthy controls). This project represents a major departure from the current functional neuroimaging and mental health research paradigms in its focus on: (1) abstract reinforcement with money (a universal secondary reinforcer that acquires its value and uniquely impacts human emotional learning and self- control through social communication); (2) positive but also negative reinforcement (going beyond the reward principle to study compromised sensitivity to punishment and adversity); using both to predict (3) self- regulation during neuroimaging (going beyond self-report as further bolstered by psychophysiological measures); and (4) the multimodal platform to automatically perform group classification (and other machine- learning techniques, e.g., multitask) such that the common neurobehavioral signatures (but also discriminative properties) of impaired self-regulation can be identified, a prototype to be generalized to other disorders of self- regulation. The size of the potentially impacted community is of significant proportions: according to current estimates, up to 20% of the adult population in the U.S. suffers from psychiatric symptoms that impair ability to exercise self-regulation. Bringing forth significant gains toward the goal of liberating patients from the cycle of relapsing behaviors (drug use or assault behaviors) that bear catastrophic consequences to the patients themselves and with devastating costs to the broader society, this tool is estimated to be of great value.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the current scientific endeavor we apply a well developed theoretical model to the study of the neurobiological underpinning of self-regulation in drug addicted individuals and those with Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

"Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications     DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)    Abstract: Can neuroscience dramatically improve our ability to design health communications? Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortaiity, both in the United Statesl and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem. Classic behavior change theories provide a foundation to develop and understand effective health campaigns and interventions;3 however there is still considerable variability in the effectiveness of such campaigns that we are unable to predict and explain. By improving our ability to understand and predict behavior change, neuroimaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl) may aid in the creation of maximally effective health campaigns. There may be important precursors of behavior change that are not easily obtained through self-reports, but that can be assessed with fMRl. In particular, people are notoriously limited in their ability to predict their own future  o. behavior and accurately identiy their internal mental processes through verbal and written self-report Our team has found that activity in a prioridefined neural regions of interest can double the proportion of variance explained in individual behavior change following persuasive messaging, beyond self-report measures (e.9. attitudes, intentions, self-efficacy).5'6 The current proposal posits a next leap: neuroimaging technology may also be applied to more accurately forecast population level responses to health communications, and could dramatically improve the way that we design and select health communications. To this end, we propose to: (1) identify the neurocognitive signatures of health communications that are successful at changing behavior at the population level; (2) use these maps to forecast the success of new health messages; and, (3) use the information gained about underlying mechanisms of message success to advance theory and to develop novel strategies for message design. We will employ sophisticated multivariate and machine learning data analysis techniques (e.9. reinforcement learning models and pattern classification) to characterize the neural systems that are involved in processing successful health messages (i.e. messages that ultimately facilitate behavior change in larger, independent groups). Such techniques will provide insight about the mechanisms that lead messages to be optimally effective for populations on average, as well as helping to understand heterogeneity within populations (i.e. for whom are given messages likely to be most effective). These techniques will also allow us to define models that optimally combine neuroimaging data with other available data sources (e.9. self-report). Achievement of our goals (to identify neural patterns that predict message success and to test the psychological meaning of these activations) will facilitate the design and dissemination of more effective health messages, and will allow more efficient translation of core theoretical advances across behavior and disease specific silos.    Public Health Relevance: Modifiable health behaviors including poor diet, physical inactivity, and tobacco and alcohol consumption are leading causes of morbidity and mortality, both in the United States1 and throughout the developed world2; yet changing these behaviors has proved an immensely challenging problem.

"Attentional control by uncertainty and reward: parietal and frontal mechanisms     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To act adaptively in complex worlds, animals require the ability identify relevant information, which helps improve their predictions and reduce the uncertainty of future actions. The selection of relevant information is accomplished by systems of attention, which have been intensively investigated in the visual domain. These studies have focused on attentional modulations of sensory perception and on mechanisms of oculomotor target selection. However, less is known about the cognitive mechanisms of attentional control: how does the brain identify stimuli that are ""relevant"" or ""attention worthy"" in a given task? Evidence from computational and behavioral studies suggests that relevance depends both on the reward associations and on the informational properties of a sensory cue. However, informational properties (uncertainty, new information) are investigated mostly in studies of learning, while studies of oculomotor control focus on the role of reward. Thus it is unknown how the brain computes relevance based on both the reward and informational constraints of a task. In the oculomotor system, two areas implicated in attentional control are the frontal eye field (FEF) and the lateral intraparietal area (LIP). However, studies of these areas have focused on their role in target selection rather than computing relevance per se. In addition, these studies reveal very similar responses in FEF and LIP, raising questions regarding their specific roles. Here we aim to answer these questions by using a combination of single neuron recordings and reversible inactivation and explicitly comparing FEF and LIP. We seek to understand (1) how is target selection in FEF and LIP influenced by reliability/uncertainty and redundancy/new information, (2) how are these variables related to expected reward and (3) whether LIP/FEF have distinct contributions to discounting redundant information and attending to reliable versus uncertain cues. The studies are innovative in that they link two topics that have been pursued in isolation, the study of attention on one hand and that of learning and statistical inference on the other, and directly compare the functions of FEF and LIP. The studies have high clinical significance since attentional disturbances are strong in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Thus, the studies will lead to an integrated theory of attentional control based on reward and uncertainty reduction, processes that are core for decision making in both health and disease.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction. Converging evidence suggests that attention is controlled jointly by reward and by the uncertainty/information a stimulus may bring, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. In addition, it is not known what the distinct contributions of parietal and frontal areas are in attentional control. Using single neuron recordings in the monkey oculomotor system, we seek to understand how uncertainty and reward interact in controlling attention and what are the distinct contributions of the parietal and the frontal lobes                   The ability to attend to relevant stimuli is critical for normal decision making and is impaired in many psychiatric disorders, including attention deficit disorder, depression and addiction.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.        The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.        Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors. We propose to build new types of instrumentation and analyses for studying the intricate link between genes and behavior in animal models of human disease.

"Learning and Compression in Human Working  Memory    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  An important, yet relatively unexplored aspect of learning and working memory is how, and under what conditions, a perceiver can capitalize on regularities in the environment to remember more information. How can our prior experiences influence how we remember our current experiences? How can such influences be exploited as tools to enhance cognitive processes in those with learning disabilities (e.g., in Autism), or to assist those with memory deficits? To address these issues, this proposal makes use of a powerful form of implicit learning known as visual statistical learning. Previous research has shown that observers are extremely sensitive to regularities in the visual environment (e.g., quickly learning that 'A' is usually followed by 'B'). Surprisingly, this learning is often completely implicit: when asked to explicitly report these regularities observers perform at chance. This implies that visual statistical learning is a powerful process that operates automatically without our intent or conscious control. However, it remains unclear what the benefits of visual statistical learning are for memory processes. In particular, statistical regularities are a form of redundancy, and to the extent that human memory compresses redundant information, learning regularities between objects should enable observers to remember information about more objects. The proposed experiments have three aims: (1) to determine whether visual statistical learning enables observers to compress information and remember more, (2) to determine the ""units"" of compression, and (3) to determine the ""level"" at which compression occurs. To investigate these issues, observers will be required to remember simple objects. Over time, some observers will see patterns in the input (e.g., 'A' often occurs with 'B'), while other observers will see random input.

"Neural Encoding of Internal Motivational States and Goal-Directed Actions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to provide advanced training in behavioral electrophysiology, while performing experiments to determine how internal motivational states are encoded in cortical-basal ganglia circuits. The proposed training program combines hands-on experience performing experimental investigations of single neuron activity with additional coursework in data analysis and statistical techniques, in a world-class environment for the scientific study of motivation.  Flexible, adaptive decision-making requires the use of information provided both by external environmental cues and internal motivational states. Altered motivational states and their influence over responses to external stimuli are central to variety of abnormal human conditions including depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, which have a tremendous impact on society. An enhanced understanding of the neural correlates of internal motivation within cortical-basal ganglia circuits would greatly inform models of normal decision-making, and provide important insights into abnormal decision-making processes in human behavioral disorders.  This proposal uses electrophysiology to explore how the activity of individual neurons and subpopulations in key brain regions is modulated by the organism's state of hunger or thirst. Internal motivation will be manipulated by selective food or water deprivation, and assessed by examining choices between these different goals during operant task performance. Recordings of single unit activity will be made in ventral striatum (VS), dorsal striatum (DS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The experiment design allows the determination of how neuronal firing reflects coding of either specific actions, specific goals (outcomes), the current value assigned to task performance (motivational drive), or combinations of these factors. Although there have been extensive prior studies of the role of value in neural representations, there has been little investigation of how deprivation state influences these core circuits for translating motivation into action.  Aim 1: To compare distinct neuronal coding of actions, goals and motivational drive in multiple striatal subregions and OFC. In brief, the major hypothesis is that action-coding will be dominant in dorsal- lateral striatum, goal-coding in dorsal-medial striatum, and drive-coding in ventral striatum. We also expect to see specific combinations of these factors such as the previously reported action-value coding.  Aim 2: To test theories of hierarchical behavioral control by examining the duration of task- related cell responses. We hypothesize that drive-coding networks organize goal-coding networks that in turn organize action-coding networks. We predict that neurons that are most strongly modulated by deprivation state will show a more prolonged response within each trial compared to neurons that principally care about specific outcomes, while action-coding neurons show the most time-limited pattern of firing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Altered motivational states and their influence over behavior underlie a variety of abnormal human conditions such as depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, all of which have a tremendous impact on society.

"Sensory based CNS diagnostics for the clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is currently a significant gap that exists between fundamental neuroscience research and translation of the findings of that research into everyday practice. Experimental findings at the genetic, cellular, molecular and systems level often take a fairly long and frequently circuitous route to make an impact on a particular neurological disease or disorder. The goal of our work is to bridge the neuroscientific gap at the systems level of study by developing standardized sensory measures that can be not only utilized in clinical or clinical research settings, but can be directly correlated with the observations obtained directly from sensory cortex in non-human primates via high resolution imaging and extracellular recording. Successful development of an experimental model that iteratively evaluates the relationship of clinical measures and systemic CNS responses to specific mechanistic alterations will be quite significant. Such an evaluation of an individual's CNS status could be directly linked to systemic mechanistic deficiencies or alterations observed in animal experimentation.  Towards that goal, we have successfully designed and fabricated a tactile sensory diagnostic device. In parallel with that development, we designed a number of protocols - based on experimental neurophysiological findings from both our non human primate research and that of others - that could be rapidly and efficiently delivered (1-3 minutes) to a number of subject populations. The tactile diagnostic system that we have developed was conceptually designed to investigate differences in cortical information processing strategies between people with autism and people without. In this proposal we ask whether or not the strategy that we have devised for investigating a population with a neurodevelopmental disorder could be broadly applied to a number of neurological disorders. In other words, we consider the changes manifested by the neurodevelpmental disorder autism to be systemic, and if systemic cortical alterations occur in other neurological disorders, could they also be detected in the same manner?  Proof-of-concept studies in a number of clinical research areas demonstrated that these newly developed metrics were sensitive to systemic cortical alterations. One question that emerges from this data is that most of these neurological disorders result in some type of altered central sensitization, no matter what the cause - whether it be neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, pharmacological or trauma induced - in which there is a significant change in the balance between excitation and inhibition. This application proposes to determine if sensory perceptual metrics, similar to those that were used to successfully distinguish subjects with autism from healthy control populations (with 90% accuracy using SVM to assess the results of a 25 minute battery of 9 protocols), could be used to reliably distinguish - on an individual basis - subjects with neurological disorders that are not neurodevelopmental in nature. Towards this goal, we target subjects from one broad category of neurological disorders - chronic pain. More specifically, we will examine the differences and commonalities from observations of pain patients diagnosed with one of the following: fibromyalgia, vulvodynia, TMJD, IBS and migraine.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research. Recently, utilizing state-of-the-art technology, we built a multi-site tactile stimulator that allows for investigation of central nervous system (CNS) health and advanced methods in sensory perceptual metrics. These metrics have been demonstrated to be sensitive to changes in centrally mediated mechanisms; and systemic alterations of cortical health (via neurodegenerational, neurodevelopmental, pharmacological or trauma induced changes) robustly change the measures. It is anticipated that clinicians will be able to utilize these measures to improve diagnostic performance and enable assessment of efficacy of treatment. The study itself will serve to validate the utility of a number of these measures in several types of pain, specifically fibromyalgia, TMJD, IBS, vulvodynia and migraine. The information from this study could aid in understanding centrally mediated mechanisms that undergo significant alterations with chronic pain.           The overall goal of the proposed work is to investigate the utility of novel sensory-based methodologies that are currently being used in both basic and clinical research.

"A new paradigm for quantifying animal behavior in a model genetic system    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Progress toward understanding and curing many human neurological diseases is hindered by a lack of methods for objective and quantitative assessment of the connections between genes and behavior. Traditional studies of animal behavior probe only a small subset of user-defined behaviors in low- dimensional data and are inappropriate for the discovery of subtle phenotypes or complex relationships between genes and behavior. To move beyond these simple representations of animal behavior, we propose to build a high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging system that can track single behaving animals. This system will quantitatively connect behavior to genetics using a data-driven method for the discovery of stereotyped motions. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a new standard for behavioral observation and automatic phenotyping to quantify the behavior of freely moving fruit flies, 2) demonstrate the sensitivity and accuracy of our new technology by studying Drosophila models of neurodegenerative diseases and the behavior of closely-related species of Drosophila fruit flies and 3) expand our system to enable simultaneous tracking and analysis of two independent flies in a single arena and test this system with assays of courtship behavior between male and female flies. The ability to measure subtle changes in behavior in a model genetic organism will bring us closer than we have ever been to understanding neurological diseases and behavioral disorders at the genetic and molecular level.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many mental health problems and neurological diseases are linked to genetic risk factors.

"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7760038,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'information processing', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2010,54367,0.006674425721796479
"Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adaptive decision making relies on the ability to evaluate and integrate potential rewards. Data from primate electrophysiology and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies implicate key structures including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum in valuation and reward-driven learning. However, how value signals from distinct rewards are integrated into a decision value remains relatively unknown. My research proposal will investigate the neural underpinnings of value computation and construction. In particular, I will conduct several experiments that will lead to a better understanding of these regions' separate contributions and functional interactions. First, I will delineate contributions of the striatum to making valuations involving only positive information, only negative information, or both (Specific Aim 1). Second, I investigate the influence of the striatum on hierarchical value computations, as necessary for complex real-world decisions (Specific Aim 2). Third, I will identify a causal role of the striatum in the manipulation of valuation processes (Specific Aim 3). Despite the large fMRI literature involving the striatum and other reward-processing regions of the brain, these aims have been unaddressed with standard fMRI analyses, which are generally limited in spatial accuracy and ill-suited to make strong conclusions regarding relationships between brain regions. My proposal will employ analytic techniques drawn from the machine- learning and biophysical literatures that are well-equipped to predict individual behavior, identify fine-scale differences in brain computational and cognitive processes, and draw conclusions about causal relationships between brain regions. These analytic techniques, combined with novel experimental designs, will allow me to make a significant contribution to an important area of the neuroscience literature. This proposal focuses on subjective value construction, deficits of which are endemic in clinical disorders. Previous research demonstrates that depressed or drug-deprived individuals differentially process positive and negative material and rewards; the research proposed here will tie those results to value computation and decisions involving risk. Additionally, a better understanding of how individuals make complex choices should prove useful for treatment of mental health disorders like depression or anxiety.           n/a",Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences,7883451,F31MH086255,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Depressed mood', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Food', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'deprivation', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2010,28699,-0.002873326292487546

This proposal uses electrophysiology to explore how the activity of individual neurons and subpopulations in key brain regions is modulated by the organism's state of hunger or thirst. Internal motivation will be manipulated by selective food or water deprivation, and assessed by examining choices between these different goals during operant task performance. Recordings of single unit activity will be made in ventral striatum (VS), dorsal striatum (DS) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The experiment design allows the determination of how neuronal firing reflects coding of either specific actions, specific goals (outcomes), the current value assigned to task performance (motivational drive), or combinations of these factors. Although there have been extensive prior studies of the role of value in neural representations, there has been little investigation of how deprivation state influences these core circuits for translating motivation into action.  Aim 1: To compare distinct neuronal coding of actions, goals and motivational drive in multiple striatal subregions and OFC. In brief, the major hypothesis is that action-coding will be dominant in dorsal- lateral striatum, goal-coding in dorsal-medial striatum, and drive-coding in ventral striatum. We also expect to see specific combinations of these factors such as the previously reported action-value coding.  Aim 2: To test theories of hierarchical behavioral control by examining the duration of task- related cell responses. We hypothesize that drive-coding networks organize goal-coding networks that in turn organize action-coding networks. We predict that neurons that are most strongly modulated by deprivation state will show a more prolonged response within each trial compared to neurons that principally care about specific outcomes, while action-coding neurons show the most time-limited pattern of firing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Altered motivational states and their influence over behavior underlie a variety of abnormal human conditions such as depression, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, eating disorders and obesity, all of which have a tremendous impact on society.

"Social Networks and Skilled Birth Attendance to Prevent Maternal Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will investigate the influence of social networks on women's decisions to use skilled birth attendants (SBA) and the criteria used in these decisions. The study aims are to 1. Explore the utility of the Network Episode Model of Utilization (NEM) in explaining women's health service utilization decision-making in the context of a normal biological event and, 2. Test the predicative power of women's self identified decision-making criteria on choice of birth attendant in the event of an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. The purpose is well aligned with the National Institute of Nursing's mission and area of research emphasis, promoting health and preventing disease. Worldwide an estimated 529,000 women die annually from pregnancy- and childbirth-related complications with a disproportionate number (99%) occurring in developing countries. Preventable and treatable conditions such as post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia and obstructed labor are the leading causes of maternal deaths worldwide. Use of a SBA to improve identification and management of these conditions is an effective means to reduce maternal mortality. However, SBA services remain underused even in settings where SBAs are available. To understand why women are using or not using SBAs during delivery, the study will employ the NEM to more fully test the influence of socio-structural context on decision making and deliniate the specific criteria used in decision-making through ethnographic decision tree modeling. The study will employ a retrospective, cross-sectional design. Face-to-face interviews using a structured interview instrument will be conducted with a representative sample of 254 women in Matlab, Bangladesh. This research will provide a model that can be used to investigate health care utilization decision-making in the context of prevention as well as illness response. The relevance to public health and the long term goal of the research is to reduce the high levels of maternal death and disability observed in vulnerable populations both in Bangladesh and the United States.

"Measuring real time decision-making about UVR Protection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of interventions to maximize consistency in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) protection rests on improved understanding of decision-making factors that contribute to daily variation in UVR protection. In this study, we use Ethnographic Decision Tree Modeling to examine decision-making regarding sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and UVR protection behavior in melanoma first-degree relatives (FDRs). In Phase I, we will generate the models via qualitative ethnographic interviews with 25 melanoma FDRs, and then will construct a composite decision-making model for each of the three UVR protection outcomes. In Phase II we will establish the validity of the models using ecological momentary assessment of UVR protection (over 14 summer days, at 1 pm and 5 pm daily) in 60 FDRs. We will recruit equal numbers of women and men, and equal numbers of those who perceive high and low advantages of tanning, given the importance of these predictors for UVR protection. Specific Aim I is to generate and establish the validity of the models explaining decision-making about three UVR protection behaviors (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, use of protective clothing) in melanoma FDRs, and Specific Aim II is to examine theory-driven affective and cognitive predictors of sun protection maintenance (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and use of sun protective clothing) assessed in real time. We adopt a theory-informed approach to decision-making, and so expect that the factors identified inductively in Phase I, as well as between- and within-subject variation in melanoma threat, efficacy beliefs, and satisfaction with UVR protection drawn from Witte's Extended Parallel Processing Model and Rothman's theory of health behavior maintenance will predict UVR protection behaviors. We will also examine gender and tanning attitudes as covariates of these effects. The study findings will increase our understanding of the decision- making context for behavioral maintenance of UVR protection, and dictate novel intervention strategies to reduce behavioral inconsistency - and increase behavioral maintenance - of UVR protection in those at high risk for melanoma.

"Category Learning in Dynamic Environments    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): On completion of training, the candidate will pursue a first tier university professorship or a position at a government research institution, and investigate human learning and decision making. His goal is to ultimately shed light on how the brain supports these behaviors to inform both clinical and neuroscientific applications. To this end, the candidate brings to bear powerful eye tracking techniques for measuring information processing of categories. The proposed research examines the interplay between the structure of the learning task and how people attend to features in the task environment. By examining such variables, the work will narrow the gap between tasks of the real world and those that are studied in the area of categories and concepts-an area that concerns the core cognitive process by which people conceive of distinct things as belonging to the same class. The proposal explores whether the effect of learning task on category representation is mediated by interplay between task dynamics and learners' sampling of the environment. To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7581008,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'information processing', 'public health relevance', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2009,51103,0.006674425721796479
"Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adaptive decision making relies on the ability to evaluate and integrate potential rewards. Data from primate electrophysiology and human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies implicate key structures including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum in valuation and reward-driven learning. However, how value signals from distinct rewards are integrated into a decision value remains relatively unknown. My research proposal will investigate the neural underpinnings of value computation and construction. In particular, I will conduct several experiments that will lead to a better understanding of these regions' separate contributions and functional interactions. First, I will delineate contributions of the striatum to making valuations involving only positive information, only negative information, or both (Specific Aim 1). Second, I investigate the influence of the striatum on hierarchical value computations, as necessary for complex real-world decisions (Specific Aim 2). Third, I will identify a causal role of the striatum in the manipulation of valuation processes (Specific Aim 3). Despite the large fMRI literature involving the striatum and other reward-processing regions of the brain, these aims have been unaddressed with standard fMRI analyses, which are generally limited in spatial accuracy and ill-suited to make strong conclusions regarding relationships between brain regions. My proposal will employ analytic techniques drawn from the machine- learning and biophysical literatures that are well-equipped to predict individual behavior, identify fine-scale differences in brain computational and cognitive processes, and draw conclusions about causal relationships between brain regions. These analytic techniques, combined with novel experimental designs, will allow me to make a significant contribution to an important area of the neuroscience literature. This proposal focuses on subjective value construction, deficits of which are endemic in clinical disorders. Previous research demonstrates that depressed or drug-deprived individuals differentially process positive and negative material and rewards; the research proposed here will tie those results to value computation and decisions involving risk. Additionally, a better understanding of how individuals make complex choices should prove useful for treatment of mental health disorders like depression or anxiety.           n/a",Neural Mechanisms for the Construction of Subjective Value and Preferences,7677589,F31MH086255,"['Affect', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Food', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'depressed', 'depression', 'deprivation', 'improved', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pleasure', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,28398,-0.002873326292487546
"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7633295,R01DA018341,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Coiled Bodies', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'System', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'egg', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'neurotransmission', 'rapid technique', 'tool']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2009,293485,-3.242453060993761e-05

"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD.

To understand the interplay between task, eye movements, and concept representation, the proposal will incorporate modern reinforcement learning techniques from the machine learning literature into a category learning model. Reinforcement learning has been used to model eye movements in other areas including reading and problem solving. Neuroscientific work has found circuits linking the basal ganglia through dopamine with the frontal cortex that appear to operate according to reinforcement learning processes (Frank and Glaus, 2006). Moreover, Yechiam, et al. (2005) showed that the parameters in reinforcement learning models appear to map to specific clinical populations as they performed in a simple gambling task. Instead of gambling tasks, or artificial category learning tasks, the goal of the proposed work is to move towards tasks that might help to understand real world behaviors and their causes. The new category-reinforcement learning model proposed here will be applied first to the candidate's existing eye movement data, a rich data set on learners' attention to category information as they learn in standard tasks. Then, the model will be applied to the proposed behavioral experiments investigating the role of task dynamics on learners' sampling behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the cognitive processes having to do with learning and attention. By exploring learning tasks that are more like those experienced in the real world, the research can improve the applicability of cognitive models for diagnosing and devising treatments for deficits from ADHD, Autism, Asperger's, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease.           n/a",Category Learning in Dynamic Environments,7408288,F32HD057695,"['Area', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computer information processing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dopamine', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Gambling', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'concept', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'research study']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2008,48739,0.006674425721796479
"Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate seeks to become independent as a neuroscientist and to work at the interface between neuroscience and physics. The Sloan-Swartz Center at UCSF provides a unique opportunity to become immersed in neuroscience at its cutting edge. While the majority of her time will be spent in research, she will attend a range of systems neuroscience and computer vision courses. The immediate goals of her research are to develop an information-theoretic method that allows for a rigorous statistical analysis of neural responses to natural stimuli, which are non- Gaussian and have strong spatiotemporal correlations; and to use this method to analyze the responses of visual cortical neurons to natural time-varying images. There are numerous indications that the responses of neurons to natural stimuli cannot be completely predicted from their responses to stimuli with simple statistical properties, such as white noise ensembles. However, existing methods for analyzing single neuron responses may be rigorously applied only to Gaussian ensembles. The information-theoretic method involves finding the stimulus dimensions that carry the most information about the neuron's response. The stimulus ensemble is not assumed to be Gaussian. The only assumption made is that the neuron is selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of the high-dimensional stimulus space: responses with respect to the relevant dimensions might be arbitrarily nonlinear. After testing the method on model neurons and verifying that it gives reasonable results for cortical neurons probed by natural scenes, the method will be used to test the categorical distinction between simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex. The method will then be modified so that a large set of directions related to each other via certain symmetry operations, such as translation or scaling, can be simultaneously found, with the goal of systematically probing neurons in extrastriate areas with natural scenes. n/a",Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli,7418710,K25MH068904,"['Accidents', 'Accounting', 'Acoustics', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Area', 'Area Analyses', 'Auditory', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Drug Formulations', 'Ear', 'Felis catus', 'Fire - disasters', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Physics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rotation', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'indium arsenide', 'interest', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'size', 'sound', 'spatiotemporal', 'vector', 'voltage']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K25,2008,97809,-0.03262966449145413
"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7440354,R01DA018341,"['Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Coiled Bodies', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Image Analysis', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Partner in relationship', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Reproducibility', 'Role', 'System', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'egg', 'genetic analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'loss of function', 'mutant', 'neurotransmission', 'rapid technique', 'tool']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2008,282792,-3.242453060993761e-05
"Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior Abstract Free-living cells display strong genome-wide transcriptional responses to changes in individual environmental parameters such as oxygen and temperature. Such transcriptional dynamics are thought to be the basis of a homeostatic response that attempts to reverse the immediate intracellular consequences resulting from the specific change in the environment. I present an alternative interpretation where transcriptional responses reflect a multifaceted behavioral program in response to global changes in the environment that are anticipated to follow the perturbation. This results from the fact that native microbial habitats are highly structured, giving rise to strong correlations between environmental parameters. Over geological timescales, such correlations can be internalized through an ""associative learning"" process that shapes the connectivity and dynamics of regulatory networks. Such internal models should allow microbes to predict the future trajectory of the environment based on immediate sensory information. We have seen evidence of this anticipatory behavior in responses of the bacterium Escherichia coli to changes in temperature and oxygen that correspond to transitions between the outside environment and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. These internal representations seem to reflect a true associative learning paradigm, since they show plasticity upon exposure to novel environments. These phenomena increasingly demand that we interpret microbial behaviors from a cognitive perspective, much as we do for understanding animal behaviors. I propose a multi-faceted research program aimed at 1) establishing that these phenomena, indeed, represent cognitive modeling of microbial habitats, 2) revealing the underlying network mechanisms, and 3) exploring associative learning of novel environments through laboratory experimental evolution. The proposed work establishes deep connections between the disparate fields of microbial ecology, regulatory network evolution, and behavior. In so doing, it challenges the dominance of the century-old notion of homeostasis, with fundamental implications for how we understand and control microbial behavior, especially in the context of disease. n/a",Towards a cognitive framework for understanding cellular behavior,7555864,DP1OD003787,"['Acidity', 'Acids', 'Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Association Learning', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genome', 'Bacteroides fragilis', 'Base Pairing', 'Basic Science', 'Beer', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Carbon', 'Cell Respiration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemotaxis', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Cyanobacterium', 'Cytochromes', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Depth', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Drops', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Employee Strikes', 'Engineering', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Enterococcus faecalis', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Figs - dietary', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genets', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Global Change', 'Growth', 'Habitats', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Homeostasis', 'Homo', 'Human', 'Hybridization Array', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Logic', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marines', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Physiology', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Detection', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'New York', 'Nitrogen', 'Numbers', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Oral cavity', 'Organism', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Output', 'Oxidases', 'Oxygen', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Perception', 'Phage Display', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Psychological Manipulation', 'Psychology', 'Pulse taking', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Salts', 'Science', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Variant', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'abstracting', 'base', 'classical conditioning', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'cytochrome c oxidase', 'day', 'density', 'design', 'electron donor', 'enteric pathogen', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'life history', 'microbial', 'microbial disease', 'mortality', 'mutant', 'novel', 'null mutation', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'programs', 'quorum sensing', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'respiratory', 'response', 'second messenger', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'transcription factor']",OD,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,DP1,2008,805000,-0.003985874491095223
"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive Enhancers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to NIMH research topic J1, neuroscience and basic behavioral science in the SBIR solicitation and PA-04-086, development of high throughput tools for brain and behavior. We aim to alleviate the bottleneck in drug discovery for cognitive dysfunction with CognoCube(tm), an automated high-throughput system of behavioral analysis of cognitive function. CognoCube(tm) will comprise innovative automated testing, computer vision, and machine-learning algorithms to capture and integrate behavioral effects of drugs affecting cognitive function. CognoCube will capture many cognitive domains of high degree of homology between humans and rodents that are relevant in CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia, attention-deficit disorder and ageing. This system will provide rapid and accurate indices of the therapeutic potential of novel cognitive enhancers. Phase I will be focused on proof of concept, namely, capture of behaviors relevant to targeted cognitive domains, sensitivity to pharmacological manipulation and robust bioinformatic analysis. The CognoCube(tm) system will expand its capacity during Phase II of the project to be able to assess a library of 1000 compounds per year. With libraries chosen to provide a high likelihood of CNS activity we expect to be able to detect up to a dozen new compounds per year with CNS activity in the area of cognition. Those compounds will be further assessed with standard tests of cognition and their mechanism of action will be studied through pharmacological means and binding profiling. Commercial value: The population that could benefit from new and improved cognitive enhancers is estimated at more than 30 million in the United States alone. Major challenges for drug discovery in this area include the lack of reliable and efficient in vivo testing systems. Although standardized objective test batteries have been developed for evaluation of human cognition, there is no such standard battery for rodents. Our automated cognitive testing system for mice will provide superior reliability, greater statistical power and higher throughput than standard cognitive tests and, with its power to screen libraries in vivo, will discover novel compounds with efficacy in cognition.         n/a",Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive Enhancers,7169555,R43MH076342,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Attention Deficit Disorder', 'Basic Behavioral Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mouse Strains', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Nootropic Agents', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Funding Mechanisms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Somatotype', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Index', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavior test', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'concept', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'tool']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2007,199963,0.012018382082323005

"Social Networks and Skilled Birth Attendance to Prevent Maternal Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will investigate the influence of social networks on women's decisions to use skilled birth attendants (SBA) and the criteria used in these decisions. The study aims are to 1. Explore the utility of the Network Episode Model of Utilization (NEM) in explaining women's health service utilization decision-making in the context of a normal biological event and, 2. Test the predicative power of women's self identified decision-making criteria on choice of birth attendant in the event of an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. The purpose is well aligned with the National Institute of Nursing's mission and area of research emphasis, promoting health and preventing disease. Worldwide an estimated 529,000 women die annually from pregnancy- and childbirth-related complications with a disproportionate number (99%) occurring in developing countries. Preventable and treatable conditions such as post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia and obstructed labor are the leading causes of maternal deaths worldwide. Use of a SBA to improve identification and management of these conditions is an effective means to reduce maternal mortality. However, SBA services remain underused even in settings where SBAs are available. To understand why women are using or not using SBAs during delivery, the study will employ the NEM to more fully test the influence of socio-structural context on decision making and deliniate the specific criteria used in decision-making through ethnographic decision tree modeling. The study will employ a retrospective, cross-sectional design. Face-to-face interviews using a structured interview instrument will be conducted with a representative sample of 254 women in Matlab, Bangladesh. This research will provide a model that can be used to investigate health care utilization decision-making in the context of prevention as well as illness response. The relevance to public health and the long term goal of the research is to reduce the high levels of maternal death and disability observed in vulnerable populations both in Bangladesh and the United States.

"Dopaminergic Mechanisms of Reward in Schizophrenia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised proposal has been developed in response to PAR-02-062 (Building Translational Research in Behavioral Science). The goal of the proposed work is to demonstrate that an explicitly translational, multidisciplinary approach to defining the role of dopamine (DA) in schizophrenia (SC), is capable of illuminating some of the most poorly understood, most treatment-resistant cognitive and motivational aspects of the illness. Specifically, recent basic research has shown that DA cell firing plays a critical role in the encoding of reward prediction and reward based learning. The proposed work will provide a rigorous test of the applicability of this hypothesis as a framework for understanding the motivational and learning impairments of SC with important implications for schizophrenia therapeutics. To test this hypothesis, we have organized a group of basic and clinical investigators into three scientific modules:1) electrophysiology, 2) neuroimaging, and 3) behavior, with the overall program designed to address different aspects of same theory of DA function. These modules are designed to develop collaborative partnerships with the results of initial pilot experiments used to refine hypothesis for further experimental testing. Initial studies are proposed to document the specific behavioral, electrophysiological, and fMRI Bold signal abnormalities of SC patients during the performance of reward learning paradigms, the impact of different antipsychotics on reward processing in animals, and the physiological sequela associated with reward-driven changes in DA cell firing. Computational modeling will be used to determine whether the experimental results in animals and observed deficits in patients are consistent with the hypothesized role of DA in reward processing. The overall program is designed to develop resources, paradigms, and proof of principle studies that illuminate the nature of DA dysfunction in SC through the application of translational paradigms and models demonstrating the critical role of DA in reward and reinforcement learning.

"CRCNS: Where to look next? Modeling eye movements in normal and impaired vision    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to gain a better understanding of the information processing and decision strategies that underlie eye movement planning in both the normal and diseased state. In patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), central areas of the retina are damaged, creating a large blind spot that forces them to rely solely on residual vision in the periphery. Rehabilitation outcomes for these patients can be successful, but are often inconsistent. Despite similar retinopathies, some patients learn to use their residual vision more effectively than others. We have developed an information-theoretic model and experimental paradigm which will allow us to objectively measure human scanning efficiency. The development of the model has naturally motivated fundamental experimental questions about eye movements and neural decision making. The answers to these questions will be used to refine the model and enhance our understanding of the system in general. We will then apply the model framework to investigate differences in eye movement behavior between AMD patients and normally-sighted individuals. The interplay of model development and experimental investigation will significantly increase our knowledge of how humans use prior knowledge and task demands to direct their gaze, and how new visual information is incorporated into an eye movement plan. The results will have broad relevance to understanding neural decision making in general.   Relevance to Public Health. The application of the model to a clinical population will bring much-needed objective measures to understanding the extent of impairment in individuals with AMD. With this understanding comes great potential for improving rehabilitation training strategies that will enhance the quality of life for these patients and their families.          n/a",CRCNS: Where to look next?

"Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is submitted in response to NIMH research topic J1, neuroscience and basic behavioral science in the SBIR solicitation and PA-04-086, development of high throughput tools for brain and behavior. We aim to alleviate the bottleneck in drug discovery for cognitive dysfunction with CognoCube(tm), an automated high-throughput system of behavioral analysis of cognitive function. CognoCube(tm) will comprise innovative automated testing, computer vision, and machine-learning algorithms to capture and integrate behavioral effects of drugs affecting cognitive function. CognoCube will capture many cognitive domains of high degree of homology between humans and rodents that are relevant in CNS disorders such as schizophrenia, dementia, attention-deficit disorder and ageing. This system will provide rapid and accurate indices of the therapeutic potential of novel cognitive enhancers. Phase I will be focused on proof of concept, namely, capture of behaviors relevant to targeted cognitive domains, sensitivity to pharmacological manipulation and robust bioinformatic analysis. The CognoCube(tm) system will expand its capacity during Phase II of the project to be able to assess a library of 1000 compounds per year. With libraries chosen to provide a high likelihood of CNS activity we expect to be able to detect up to a dozen new compounds per year with CNS activity in the area of cognition. Those compounds will be further assessed with standard tests of cognition and their mechanism of action will be studied through pharmacological means and binding profiling. Commercial value: The population that could benefit from new and improved cognitive enhancers is estimated at more than 30 million in the United States alone. Major challenges for drug discovery in this area include the lack of reliable and efficient in vivo testing systems. Although standardized objective test batteries have been developed for evaluation of human cognition, there is no such standard battery for rodents. Our automated cognitive testing system for mice will provide superior reliability, greater statistical power and higher throughput than standard cognitive tests and, with its power to screen libraries in vivo, will discover novel compounds with efficacy in cognition.         n/a",Higher Throughput Behavioral Screening of Cognitive,7054033,R43MH076342,"['attention', 'behavior test', 'bioinformatics', 'biological models', 'biotechnology', 'cognition', 'computer system hardware', 'drug discovery /isolation', 'drug screening /evaluation', 'executive function', 'high throughput technology', 'laboratory mouse', 'model design /development', 'pharmacokinetics', 'psychopharmacologic agent', 'short term memory']",NIMH,"PSYCHOGENICS, INC.",R43,2006,200000,0.012018382082323005
"Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our goal is to use neuroinformatics to help resolve the conflicting findings from which two models of olfactory coding have emerged. One model proposes that very many low-specificity neural responses represent each odorant and the other model suggests that fewer, more specific olfactory receptors bind to particular molecular features and that the combination of these specific responses characterizes each odorant. Since much of the data supporting the low-specificity model has been collected without regard for the exquisite spatial heterogeneity of the olfactory system, it is possible that the differences in conclusions could be resolved if the distinct types of data that are collected by various laboratories were placed into spatial register with one another. To that end, we have been building an archive of the spatial patterns of glomerular responses evoked by a wide range of odorants, and we have been able to test hypotheses regarding strategies of olfactory coding by calculating homologies across glomerular-layer response patterns. To facilitate our analytical task, and to make it feasible for others to place their data in register with this odorant response archive, we propose to continue to develop analytical and visualization software for olfactory bulb data. We also propose to extend this approach to both the olfactory epithelium and olfactory cortex to be able to understand both the initial coding and synthetic levels of the olfactory system.  These efforts will be freely available via the web site on which our olfactory activity archive is posted. We propose to improve the site by incorporating meta-data, as well as data from labs using other species and other types of data, such as lesions and neurophysiological data that can be located in space. Finally, the wide range of odorants that we must test to capture a sense of the system also will necessitate the use of an informatics approach to allow us to test hypotheses regarding the complex means by which chemical structure is represented in the system. The combination of these approaches should help resolve the differences between the conflicting models of olfactory coding. n/a",Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding,7068069,R01DC006516,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'bioinformatics', 'chemoreceptors', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'image processing', 'information retrieval', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rat', 'mathematical model', 'meta analysis', 'neural information processing', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'olfactions', 'olfactory lobe', 'olfactory stimulus', 'respiratory epithelium', 'sensory mechanism', 'stimulus /response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE,R01,2006,19532,-0.0016882217202855115
"Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate seeks to become independent as a neuroscientist and to work at the interface between neuroscience and physics. The Sloan-Swartz Center at UCSF provides a unique opportunity to become immersed in neuroscience at its cutting edge. While the majority of her time will be spent in research, she will attend a range of systems neuroscience and computer vision courses. The immediate goals of her research are to develop an information-theoretic method that allows for a rigorous statistical analysis of neural responses to natural stimuli, which are non- Gaussian and have strong spatiotemporal correlations; and to use this method to analyze the responses of visual cortical neurons to natural time-varying images. There are numerous indications that the responses of neurons to natural stimuli cannot be completely predicted from their responses to stimuli with simple statistical properties, such as white noise ensembles. However, existing methods for analyzing single neuron responses may be rigorously applied only to Gaussian ensembles. The information-theoretic method involves finding the stimulus dimensions that carry the most information about the neuron's response. The stimulus ensemble is not assumed to be Gaussian. The only assumption made is that the neuron is selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of the high-dimensional stimulus space: responses with respect to the relevant dimensions might be arbitrarily nonlinear. After testing the method on model neurons and verifying that it gives reasonable results for cortical neurons probed by natural scenes, the method will be used to test the categorical distinction between simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex. The method will then be modified so that a large set of directions related to each other via certain symmetry operations, such as translation or scaling, can be simultaneously found, with the goal of systematically probing neurons in extrastriate areas with natural scenes. n/a",Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli,7035246,K25MH068904,"['biophysics', 'cats', 'information theory', 'mathematics', 'method development', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'neurophysiology', 'statistics /biometry', 'stimulus /response', 'visual cortex', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,K25,2006,92195,-0.03262966449145413
"Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior and development at the molecular and cellular levels. In particular, the ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function. However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely. Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system function, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of mutant phenotypes, especially those related to behavior.       The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the phenotypic patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatments in C. elegans. By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of mutants with abnormal locomotion or egglaying, these tools will be particularly useful for correlating specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns. These analytical tools will also be used to generate a comprehensive database containing complex behavioral data on a large set of mutant strains. This database will make it possible to identify groups of mutants and pharmacological treatments that have similar effects on behavior or development. With the accumulation of increasing phenotypic data on known mutants, it should ultimately be possible to record from unknown mutant or drug-treated animals and make informed initial hypotheses about the functions of uncharacterized genes and the targets of uncharacterized drugs.         n/a",Machine vision analysis of C.elegans phenotypic patterns,7095200,R01DA018341,"['Caenorhabditis elegans', 'behavior', 'bioinformatics', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'ethology', 'molecular biology information system', 'neurogenetics', 'phenotype']",NIDA,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2006,293309,-3.242453060993761e-05
"Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Inter-observer variability in mammogram reading has been well documented in the literature. Various factors have been used to explain this variability; among them, the most significant are related to the management of perceived findings.  However, the nature of this inter-observer variability has not been explored. Namely, were the lesions that were consistently reported by the radiologists any different from the ones that yield disagreement? Furthermore, could these differences be quantitatively assessed? Moreover, were these differences in any way related with the experience level of the observer? In addition, the interpretation of perceived findings is closely related with the visual search strategy used to scan the breast tissue, because observers compare perceived findings with the background, in order to determine their uniqueness. Hence, what is the effect of visual search strategy on inter-observer variability? Can this effect be modeled using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)? Can inferences be made regarding the observers' decision patterns by analyzing the results of simulations run on the ANNs?  The work described here aims at answering these questions. We will use spatial frequency analysis to characterize the areas on mammogram cases where mammographers, chest radiologists with experience reading mammograms and radiology residents at the end of their mammography rotation, indicate the presence of a finding, or fail to do so. We will assess inter-observer agreement, as well as intra- and inter-group agreement for the various groups of observers. In addition, we will train artificial neural networks to represent each observer, in such a way that by changing the nature of the features input to the ANNs we will be able to simulate how such changes would have affected the actual observer. We will assess the effects on inter-observer variability of changing the search strategy used by the observer to sample the breast tissue. In our setting, the inter-observer variability will be assessed by comparing the outputs of the ANNs that represent each observer. In addition, the changes in sampling strategy will correspond to actual possible strategies for the human observers themselves. n/a",Perception and Inter-Observer Variability in Mammography,6924688,R21CA100107,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'breast neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'clinical research', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'human data', 'human therapy evaluation', 'mammography', 'visual perception']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2005,167063,-0.03180738351020286
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6857150,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', 'body movement', 'corticofugal system', 'electrodes', 'electronic recording system', 'laboratory rat', 'neural information processing', 'neurons', 'neuroregulation', 'sensory discrimination', 'solitary tract nucleus', 'somesthetic sensory cortex', 'stimulus /response', 'thalamic nuclei', 'touch', 'trigeminal nerve', 'vibrissae', 'wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,358050,0.0038076097434771744

Since much of the data supporting the low-specificity model has been collected without regard for the exquisite spatial heterogeneity of the olfactory system, it is possible that the differences in conclusions could be resolved if the distinct types of data that are collected by various laboratories were placed into spatial register with one another. To that end, we have been building an archive of the spatial patterns of glomerular responses evoked by a wide range of odorants, and we have been able to test hypotheses regarding strategies of olfactory coding by calculating homologies across glomerular-layer response patterns. To facilitate our analytical task, and to make it feasible for others to place their data in register with this odorant response archive, we propose to continue to develop analytical and visualization software for olfactory bulb data. We also propose to extend this approach to both the olfactory epithelium and olfactory cortex to be able to understand both the initial coding and synthetic levels of the olfactory system.  These efforts will be freely available via the web site on which our olfactory activity archive is posted. We propose to improve the site by incorporating meta-data, as well as data from labs using other species and other types of data, such as lesions and neurophysiological data that can be located in space. Finally, the wide range of odorants that we must test to capture a sense of the system also will necessitate the use of an informatics approach to allow us to test hypotheses regarding the complex means by which chemical structure is represented in the system. The combination of these approaches should help resolve the differences between the conflicting models of olfactory coding. n/a",Neuroinformatic Analysis of Olfactory Coding,6803809,R01DC006516,"['artificial intelligence', 'automated data processing', 'bioinformatics', 'chemoreceptors', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'image processing', 'information retrieval', 'laboratory mouse', 'laboratory rat', 'mathematical model', 'meta analysis', 'neural information processing', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'olfactions', 'olfactory lobe', 'olfactory stimulus', 'respiratory epithelium', 'sensory mechanism', 'stimulus /response']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE,R01,2004,20000,-0.0016882217202855115
"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy. (3) Construction of a theoretical       model of the information processing performed by the hippocampus. (4)                Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network model of the processing               performed by the hippocampus. (5) Evaluation of the ""biological computing""           capabilities of the in vivo mammalian hippocampus by presenting specific             computational problems in the form of trial-specific stimulus sequences, and         reading the solutions to those computations as a combination of hippocampal          neural activity and behavioral outcome.                                                                                                                                   n/a",ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS,6740109,R01MH061397,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior disorders', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'decision making', 'hippocampus', 'laboratory rat', 'model design /development', 'neural information processing', 'neuroanatomy', 'neuronal guidance', 'neurons', 'neuropsychology', 'online computer', 'performance', 'short term memory', 'space perception', 'stimulus /response', 'temporal lobe /cortex']",NIMH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2004,252000,-0.003266345519081663
"Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems   DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Biochemical signal transduction is a        critical basic cellular process by which information travels from the receptors      on the surface of a cell to the nucleus where responses to the signals are           generated. Originally thought to be a relatively simple system that merely           passed along signals, signal transduction has proven to be a highly complicated      system of molecules whose interactions have yet to be fully understood.              Furthermore, a number of disease states such as cancer, diabetes, and                neurological disorders have their origins in malfunctioning signal transduction      components. Until signal transduction is understood in its totality, rational        intervention of these diseases will be significantly hampered. While                 conventional laboratory methods have been used to study individual components        or pathways involved in signal transduction, they have less utility in studying      how signal transduction systems work as a whole and therefore do not detect          higher levels or organization and regulation that are known to exist in other        complex systems. In this application, it is proposed that signal transduction        systems be mathematically modeled and analyzed in order to determine the role        of complexity in the system. It is hypothesized that signal transduction             involves both the movement and processing of information in such a way as to         provide a cell the capacity for decision making, something every cell must           possess at some level. The most advanced techniques in the field of chaos            theory and neural networks (the basis of artificial intelligence) will be            applied to determine whether biochemical signal transduction systems have the        fundamental features of a complex system, how those features might be used for       cell level decision making, and how mutations in the system might affect the         higher level functions of the system. The elucidation of such higher levels of       function in signal transduction systems would greatly enhance our understanding      of this basic cellular function and make the rational design of therapy more         effective.                                                                                                                                                                n/a",Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems,6745076,R01GM067272,"['biological information processing', 'biological signal transduction', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'mathematical model', 'mathematics', 'model design /development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA OMAHA,R01,2004,314225,-0.015605224896400625
"Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate seeks to become independent as a neuroscientist and to work at the interface between neuroscience and physics. The Sloan-Swartz Center at UCSF provides a unique opportunity to become immersed in neuroscience at its cutting edge. While the majority of her time will be spent in research, she will attend a range of systems neuroscience and computer vision courses. The immediate goals of her research are to develop an information-theoretic method that allows for a rigorous statistical analysis of neural responses to natural stimuli, which are non- Gaussian and have strong spatiotemporal correlations; and to use this method to analyze the responses of visual cortical neurons to natural time-varying images. There are numerous indications that the responses of neurons to natural stimuli cannot be completely predicted from their responses to stimuli with simple statistical properties, such as white noise ensembles. However, existing methods for analyzing single neuron responses may be rigorously applied only to Gaussian ensembles. The information-theoretic method involves finding the stimulus dimensions that carry the most information about the neuron's response. The stimulus ensemble is not assumed to be Gaussian. The only assumption made is that the neuron is selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of the high-dimensional stimulus space: responses with respect to the relevant dimensions might be arbitrarily nonlinear. After testing the method on model neurons and verifying that it gives reasonable results for cortical neurons probed by natural scenes, the method will be used to test the categorical distinction between simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex. The method will then be modified so that a large set of directions related to each other via certain symmetry operations, such as translation or scaling, can be simultaneously found, with the goal of systematically probing neurons in extrastriate areas with natural scenes. n/a",Probing neural feature selectivity with natural stimuli,6774651,K25MH068904,"['biophysics', 'cats', 'information theory', 'mathematics', 'method development', 'neural information processing', 'neural transmission', 'neurophysiology', 'statistics /biometry', 'stimulus /response', 'visual cortex', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO,K25,2004,110194,-0.03262966449145413
"CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              The goal of this work is to help clarify the contribution of the hippocampus to      memory by testing the implications of a recently-developed theoretical               framework for understanding the complementary roles of the hippocampus and           neocortex in learning and memory. This framework centers around a set of             principles derived from computational neural network models, and we have             instantiated it in a specific biologically-based model. Many prominent theories      of the hippocampus assume that it contributes to memory by storing conjunctive       representations of the features that make up a particular experience. However,       this idea is too general because there are a number of reports that animals          with severe damage to the hippocampus solve problems that require conjunctive        representations. The present model recognizes that the cortical system alone         can store stimulus conjunctions. However, it is posited that the hippocampal         and cortical systems differ along two important dimensions: (a) learning             rate-the hippocampal system rapidly stores conjunctions whereas the cortical         system learns more slowly, and (b) the task demands under which the two systems      are driven to develop conjunctive representations-the hippocampal system has a       natural bias to automatically store conjunctions just as a function of the           organism sampling the environment, whereas the cortex is not naturally biased        to store conjunctions, and only does so when forced to by the demands of a           problem (e.g., reinforcement contingencies). As implemented in the present           model, these ideas provide a good account of many phenomena in the literature.       By comparing rats with damage to the hippocampus and intact rats, and                conducting additional simulations, the goal is to evaluate the proposed              theoretical framework by testing its implications for: (a) when the hippocampus      will contribute to complex nonlinear discrimination problems, (b) understanding      how the hippocampus contributes to contextual fear conditioning, (c) the role        of the hippocampus in tasks where conjunctions are automatically learned versus      those where they must be learned to satisfy the contingencies of reinforcement,      and (d) how the hippocampus mediates what some call logical reasoning                (transitive inferences). By pursuing these aims, the proposed research will          provide a more complete understanding of the role of the hippocampus in memory.                                                                                                                                                                                n/a",CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS,6639162,R01MH061316,"['artificial intelligence', ' autogenic training', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' discrimination learning', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' learning', ' mathematical model', ' memory', ' neocortex', ' neural information processing', ' neurophysiology', ' psychological reinforcement', ' startle reaction']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER,R01,2003,181110,0.013536784399976723
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6634690,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' corticofugal system', ' electrodes', ' electronic recording system', ' laboratory rat', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' neuroregulation', ' sensory discrimination', ' solitary tract nucleus', ' somesthetic sensory cortex', ' stimulus /response', ' thalamic nuclei', ' touch', ' trigeminal nerve', ' vibrissae', ' wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2003,358050,0.0038076097434771744

"Machine vision analysis of nematode behavioral patterns.  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a near complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior at the molecular and cellular levels.  The ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function such as addiction.  However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely.  Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system functions, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of behavioral phenotypes.

"Self and Consciousness: Roots of Humanity?   DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): This is a proposal for a two-day             symposium and associated book entitled, ""Self and Consciousness: Roots of             Humanity?"" The purpose of the conference is to elucidate the many ways in which      self and consciousness interrelate. This will lead to substantial increases in       the understanding of both self and identity (by identifying the ways in which        personal and social self-definition depend on consciousness, and under what          conditions, and with what effects, consciousness gives rise to                       self-consciousness) and consciousness (by specifying the diverse ways in which       self and identity are implicated in the many facets of consciousness). The           concepts of self/identity and consciousness each have recently come to the fore      in the social and behavioral sciences. However, the ways in which these              multidimensional constructs are connected has received limited attention.            Further, existing work on self and consciousness is piecemeal and fragmented,        spread across a wide range of topics and studied by scholars from diverse            disciplines. The symposium will identify, organize, and prioritize a set of          theoretical questions, investigative approaches, and empirical findings              pertaining to the role of self and identity as antecedents, accompaniments, and      consequences of consciousness. In doing so, the conference/book will set an          agenda for future research in this area and point toward prevention and              treatment strategies for mental illnesses involving disturbances of self and/or      consciousness. The symposium will be structured as follows: (1) Where we came        from - Self and consciousness in ""prehuman"" species (are humans really               unique?) and through human history (is there something special about modern          self and consciousness?); (2) Where we are now: Humans as biological beasts and      cognitive creatures - The brain and mind as biological and cognitive systems         underlying self and consciousness; (3) Where we are now: Humans as social            beings-The social underpinnings of self and consciousness, including how self        and consciousness emerge in face-to-face interactions over the course of             development and how societal belief systems impact (and often disturb) the self      and consciousness of individuals; (4) Where we might go - Where humans will          likely go in the future, including how human selves and consciousness might be       changed by interacting with computers and related electronic media and the           possibility of the construction of ""conscious computers with selves."" Each           topic will be addressed by two speakers followed by a discussant. An edited          volume based on the conference will be published by Oxford University Press.         This book will not be a simple proceedings collection. The editor and an             independent referee will read each paper. The editor will synthesize the             critiques and send them to each author, who will then revise his/her contribution.  In addition, the associated published book will have an introductory chapter that  describes the volume's themes and organization, and a concluding chapter that  summarizes the chapters and highlights emergent issues. n/a",Self and Consciousness: Roots of Humanity?,6416745,R13MH064642,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' books', ' cognition', ' computer human interaction', ' consciousness', ' evolution', ' identity', ' interpersonal relations', ' meeting /conference /symposium', ' psychological identification', ' social psychology', ' travel']",NIMH,RUTGERS THE ST UNIV OF NJ NEW BRUNSWICK,R13,2002,24550,-0.028679387877702158
"CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              The goal of this work is to help clarify the contribution of the hippocampus to      memory by testing the implications of a recently-developed theoretical               framework for understanding the complementary roles of the hippocampus and           neocortex in learning and memory. This framework centers around a set of             principles derived from computational neural network models, and we have             instantiated it in a specific biologically-based model. Many prominent theories      of the hippocampus assume that it contributes to memory by storing conjunctive       representations of the features that make up a particular experience. However,       this idea is too general because there are a number of reports that animals          with severe damage to the hippocampus solve problems that require conjunctive        representations. The present model recognizes that the cortical system alone         can store stimulus conjunctions. However, it is posited that the hippocampal         and cortical systems differ along two important dimensions: (a) learning             rate-the hippocampal system rapidly stores conjunctions whereas the cortical         system learns more slowly, and (b) the task demands under which the two systems      are driven to develop conjunctive representations-the hippocampal system has a       natural bias to automatically store conjunctions just as a function of the           organism sampling the environment, whereas the cortex is not naturally biased        to store conjunctions, and only does so when forced to by the demands of a           problem (e.g., reinforcement contingencies). As implemented in the present           model, these ideas provide a good account of many phenomena in the literature.       By comparing rats with damage to the hippocampus and intact rats, and                conducting additional simulations, the goal is to evaluate the proposed              theoretical framework by testing its implications for: (a) when the hippocampus      will contribute to complex nonlinear discrimination problems, (b) understanding      how the hippocampus contributes to contextual fear conditioning, (c) the role        of the hippocampus in tasks where conjunctions are automatically learned versus      those where they must be learned to satisfy the contingencies of reinforcement,      and (d) how the hippocampus mediates what some call logical reasoning                (transitive inferences). By pursuing these aims, the proposed research will          provide a more complete understanding of the role of the hippocampus in memory.                                                                                                                                                                                n/a",CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS,6539073,R01MH061316,"['artificial intelligence', ' autogenic training', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' discrimination learning', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' learning', ' mathematical model', ' memory', ' neocortex', ' neural information processing', ' neurophysiology', ' psychological reinforcement', ' startle reaction']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO AT BOULDER,R01,2002,217428,0.013536784399976723
"Continuous Digital Video Behavioral Analysis of Rats  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The behavioral components of electrographic seizures in rodents, primarily rats and mice, are generally used as the most fundamental basis for the presence of epileptic seizures. Numerous research grants use analysis of animal seizures as a fundamental component of the research, even research aimed at molecular and cellular mechanisms. The abnormal behaviors during a motor seizure are generally distinctive, but a certain degree of subjectivity is present from one laboratory to another. With the development of sophisticated electrodes for multiple recordings and the availability of radiotelemetry systems, the potential to combine automated studies of seizure behavior and electrographic seizure activity is now possible. We propose to develop and validate behavioral algorithms for identifying, classifying and quantifying the motor components of different types of seizures in mice and rats using digital video technology. We will define the behavioral components of different classes of seizures, and to do this in conjunction with electrographic seizures from EEG recordings. These behaviors will include but not be limited to unilateral and bilateral forelimb clonus and the assumption of a lordotic posture, with a characteristic positioning of the tail. A system that allows combined analysis of EEG and behavior will be fully developed to meet the demand from research laboratories at universities and pharmaceutical companies.   n/a",Continuous Digital Video Behavioral Analysis of Rats,6549823,R43DA015571,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior test', ' body movement', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' digital imaging', ' drug addiction', ' electron optics', ' ethology', ' laboratory rat', ' nicotine', ' posture', ' psychometrics', ' self medication', ' video recording system', ' videotape /videodisc']",NIDA,"CLEVER SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2002,113671,-0.04997961132601125
"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6516620,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' corticofugal system', ' electrodes', ' electronic recording system', ' laboratory rat', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' neuroregulation', ' sensory discrimination', ' solitary tract nucleus', ' somesthetic sensory cortex', ' stimulus /response', ' thalamic nuclei', ' touch', ' trigeminal nerve', ' vibrissae', ' wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2002,358050,0.0038076097434771744
"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy. (3) Construction of a theoretical       model of the information processing performed by the hippocampus. (4)                Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network model of the processing               performed by the hippocampus. (5) Evaluation of the ""biological computing""           capabilities of the in vivo mammalian hippocampus by presenting specific             computational problems in the form of trial-specific stimulus sequences, and         reading the solutions to those computations as a combination of hippocampal          neural activity and behavioral outcome.                                                                                                                                   n/a",ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS,6539088,R01MH061397,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior disorders', ' behavior prediction', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' decision making', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neuroanatomy', ' neuronal guidance', ' neurons', ' neuropsychology', ' online computer', ' performance', ' short term memory', ' space perception', ' stimulus /response', ' temporal lobe /cortex']",NIMH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2002,249060,-0.003266345519081663
"Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems   DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Biochemical signal transduction is a        critical basic cellular process by which information travels from the receptors      on the surface of a cell to the nucleus where responses to the signals are           generated. Originally thought to be a relatively simple system that merely           passed along signals, signal transduction has proven to be a highly complicated      system of molecules whose interactions have yet to be fully understood.              Furthermore, a number of disease states such as cancer, diabetes, and                neurological disorders have their origins in malfunctioning signal transduction      components. Until signal transduction is understood in its totality, rational        intervention of these diseases will be significantly hampered. While                 conventional laboratory methods have been used to study individual components        or pathways involved in signal transduction, they have less utility in studying      how signal transduction systems work as a whole and therefore do not detect          higher levels or organization and regulation that are known to exist in other        complex systems. In this application, it is proposed that signal transduction        systems be mathematically modeled and analyzed in order to determine the role        of complexity in the system. It is hypothesized that signal transduction             involves both the movement and processing of information in such a way as to         provide a cell the capacity for decision making, something every cell must           possess at some level. The most advanced techniques in the field of chaos            theory and neural networks (the basis of artificial intelligence) will be            applied to determine whether biochemical signal transduction systems have the        fundamental features of a complex system, how those features might be used for       cell level decision making, and how mutations in the system might affect the         higher level functions of the system. The elucidation of such higher levels of       function in signal transduction systems would greatly enhance our understanding      of this basic cellular function and make the rational design of therapy more         effective.                                                                                                                                                                n/a",Attractors of Complex Signal Transduction Systems,6583980,R01GM067272,"['biological information processing', ' biological signal transduction', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' mathematical model', ' mathematics', ' model design /development']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA OMAHA,R01,2002,209000,-0.015605224896400625
"Machine vision analysis of nematode behavioral patterns.  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The nematode C. elegans has powerful genetics, a well-described nervous system, and a near complete genome sequence; thus, it is well suited to analysis of behavior at the molecular and cellular levels.  The ability to functionally map the influence of particular genes to specific behavioral consequences makes it possible to use genetic analysis to functionally dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying poorly understood aspects of nervous system function such as addiction.  However, many genes with critical roles in neuronal function have effects on behavior that to a casual observer appear very subtle or difficult to describe precisely.  Therefore, to fully realize the potential of C. elegans for the genetic analysis of nervous system functions, it is necessary to develop sophisticated methods for the rapid and consistent quantitation of behavioral phenotypes.   The goal of this proposed work is to develop computer vision tools for quantitatively characterizing the behavioral patterns caused by mutations or pharmacological treatment in C. elegans.  By making it possible to precisely characterize the behavioral phenotypes of uncoordinated, locomotion-abnormal mutants, these tools will be particularly useful for correlation specific neurotransmission defects with characteristic behavioral patterns.  These analytical tools will also be used to precisely define the long-term effects of neuroactive drugs on behavioral, opening the possibility of genetic screening for mutants with defects in tolerance and dependence. n/a",Machine vision analysis of nematode behavioral patterns.,6569575,R21DA015823,"['Caenorhabditis elegans', ' automated data processing', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' drug addiction', ' gene mutation', ' genetic screening', ' genome', ' invertebrate locomotion', ' mutant', ' neural transmission', ' neurophysiology', ' neuropsychology', ' nicotine', ' nicotinic receptors', ' phenotype', ' substance abuse related behavior']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO,R21,2002,152000,-0.0035387804429182165
"COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Abstract)                                                                                                                              The broad objective of this proposal is to establish a quantitative              algorithmic link between cellular and molecular events involved in reward        processing and the behaviors that these events influence.  In particular, we     will focus on the nature and use of information that midbrain dopamine           systems construct and distribute to neural structures throughout the brain.      The activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral segmental area and               substantia nigra has long been identified with the processing of rewarding       stimuli.  These neurons send axons to brain structures involved in               motivation and goal directed behavior.  These same dopamine systems are          targets for disruption by disease and by drugs of abuse like heroine and         cocaine.  In alert primates, experiments show that the outputs of these          neurons encode errors between the predictions of future rewards and actual       times and magnitudes of future rewards.  The prediction errors are               apparently encoded as changes in the instantaneous spiking rates:  values        above baseline mean that the current state is 'better than predicted',           values below mean that the current state is 'worse than predicted', and no       difference means that 'things are as predicted'.  We have developed a            computational model of the behavior of midbrain dopamine neurons using a         method of adaptive optimizing control called the method of temporal              differences.  The model is consistent with electrophysiological and              behavioral data in monkeys, and also provably executes the appropriate           computational function of determining which actions maximize long-term           rewards.  The long term goal of this project is to provide a computational       connection between the action of dopaminergic mechanisms at the molecular        and cellular level and the consequences of these mechanisms on behaviors         observed in drug addiction.  Three approaches will be used to accomplish         this long term goal:  (1) human behavioral experiments, (2) mathematical         analysis, and (3) computer simulations of virtual creatures in complex           environments.  These three methods will focus on the function of                 dopaminergic systems in the primate and will be used to probe how normal         mechanisms for making decisions in the face of rewards can be disrupted in       addiction.                                                                        n/a",COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD,6495247,R01DA011723,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' decision making', ' dopamine', ' drug addiction', ' electrophysiology', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' reinforcer']",NIDA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2001,37627,-0.006319879715556911

"Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing   DESCRIPTION: In every mammalian sensory system, descending corticothalamic           projections, which originate in multiple cortical areas and reach several            thalamic relay nuclei, far outnumber the terminals of parallel feedforward           projections that carry information from the periphery to the same thalamic           structures. Despite numerous studies and a series of theories which have             attempted to illuminate the role of these massive descending feedback                projections in sensory information processing, the functional relevance of           these pathways remains largely unknown. Here, we propose to investigate the          physiological contribution of somatosensory corticothalamic projections to the       tactile responses of neurons located in the main thalamic relay nucleus of the       trigeminal system, the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Based on extensive          preliminary data, we propose that, by providing both excitatory and inhibitory       influences to the somatosensory thalamus, corticofugal projections endow             thalamic neurons with the ability to enhance the differences between orthogonal      tactile stimuli and modify the type of information transmitted to the cortex         according to the behavioral state of the animal. The functional roles of             cortical feedback projections will be assessed by a series of experiments that       combine simultaneous multi-site neural ensemble recordings and reversible            cortical inactivation, in behaving animals. The activity of large populations        of single cortical and thalamic neurons will be simultaneously recorded in the       same rat, while its facial whiskers are stimulated with complex tactile stimuli      generated either passively or during an active behavioral whisker-dependant          discrimination task. Focal regions of the primary somatosensory cortex will be       reversibly inactivated during these simultaneous thalamocortical recordings.         This will allow us to evaluate how cortical projections contribute to the            generation of thalamic sensory responses to complex tactile stimuli. We predict      that in rats cortical feedback facilitates the thalamic responses to a whisker       column stimulus, while suppressing responses to a whisker row. Modifications in      the balance of these contrasting influences should also account for the              observation that VPM neurons become capable of integrating rapid sequences of        whisker column stimuli generated during active whisker exploration. n/a",Corticofugal Modulation of Tactile Sensory Processing,6331594,R01DE013810,"['artificial intelligence', ' body movement', ' corticofugal system', ' electrodes', ' electronic recording system', ' laboratory rat', ' neural information processing', ' neurons', ' neuroregulation', ' sensory discrimination', ' solitary tract nucleus', ' somesthetic sensory cortex', ' stimulus /response', ' thalamic nuclei', ' touch', ' trigeminal nerve', ' vibrissae', ' wakefulness']",NIDCR,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2001,358050,0.0038076097434771744
"ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              Studies involving hippocampal neural ensemble recordings in rodents performing       a delayed-nonmatch-to-sample (DNMS) task have demonstrated a distinct                correlation between a sequence of external stimuli (i.e., behavioral events),        patterns of firing across hippocampal neurons in response to those stimuli, and      the animal's decision-making process which determines the response on a given        trial. Behavioral errors have been shown to correlate to neural activity             patterns (i.e. ensemble ""states"") that were at variance with the actual stimuli      or behavioral responses executed by the animal. As a model of decision making,       hippocampal activity during performance of the DNMS task can be viewed as the        result of a neural circuit that integrates information regarding task-relevant       stimuli, task demands, spatial position and trial sequence across trials, and        predicts the appropriate signal strength for encoding task-relevant information      on the next trial. Thus, ensemble firing pattern of weak to moderate strength        (as measured via information theoretic and canonical discriminant analyses) may      sufficiently encode information sufficient for correct responses on trials with      short delays, but not on long delays. In contrast, strongly encoded information      would bridge a long delay, but could interfere with the encoding of novel            information on the subsequent trial. On a given trial, the role of a prediction      circuit including the hippocampus is to determine the appropriate response           based on the prior task-relevant information. In fact, two decisions are being       performed by this neural circuit, the appropriate response, and the appropriate      signal strength for the encoding. This project is designed around the following      goals with respect to studying this hippocampal decision circuit: (1) In depth       characterization of patterns of spatial and temporal correlation between             hippocampal neurons during the decision-making stages of the spatial and             nonspatial variants of the DNMS task. (2) Identification of the temporal nature      of neural firing patterns that correlate to the decisions required for               successful behavioral response, combined with known placement of recorded            neurons with respect to hippocampal anatomy. (3) Construction of a theoretical       model of the information processing performed by the hippocampus. (4)                Implementation of an Artificial Neural Network model of the processing               performed by the hippocampus. (5) Evaluation of the ""biological computing""           capabilities of the in vivo mammalian hippocampus by presenting specific             computational problems in the form of trial-specific stimulus sequences, and         reading the solutions to those computations as a combination of hippocampal          neural activity and behavioral outcome.                                                                                                                                   n/a",ANALYSIS OF HIPPOCAMPAL ENCODING OF BEHAVIORAL DECISIONS,6392761,R01MH061397,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavior disorders', ' behavior prediction', ' behavior test', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' decision making', ' hippocampus', ' laboratory rat', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' neuroanatomy', ' neuronal guidance', ' neurons', ' neuropsychology', ' online computer', ' performance', ' short term memory', ' space perception', ' stimulus /response', ' temporal lobe /cortex']",NIMH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2001,249900,-0.003266345519081663
"COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD DESCRIPTION:  (Applicant's Abstract)                                                                                                                              The broad objective of this proposal is to establish a quantitative              algorithmic link between cellular and molecular events involved in reward        processing and the behaviors that these events influence.  In particular, we     will focus on the nature and use of information that midbrain dopamine           systems construct and distribute to neural structures throughout the brain.      The activity of dopamine neurons of the ventral segmental area and               substantia nigra has long been identified with the processing of rewarding       stimuli.  These neurons send axons to brain structures involved in               motivation and goal directed behavior.  These same dopamine systems are          targets for disruption by disease and by drugs of abuse like heroine and         cocaine.  In alert primates, experiments show that the outputs of these          neurons encode errors between the predictions of future rewards and actual       times and magnitudes of future rewards.  The prediction errors are               apparently encoded as changes in the instantaneous spiking rates:  values        above baseline mean that the current state is 'better than predicted',           values below mean that the current state is 'worse than predicted', and no       difference means that 'things are as predicted'.  We have developed a            computational model of the behavior of midbrain dopamine neurons using a         method of adaptive optimizing control called the method of temporal              differences.  The model is consistent with electrophysiological and              behavioral data in monkeys, and also provably executes the appropriate           computational function of determining which actions maximize long-term           rewards.  The long term goal of this project is to provide a computational       connection between the action of dopaminergic mechanisms at the molecular        and cellular level and the consequences of these mechanisms on behaviors         observed in drug addiction.  Three approaches will be used to accomplish         this long term goal:  (1) human behavioral experiments, (2) mathematical         analysis, and (3) computer simulations of virtual creatures in complex           environments.  These three methods will focus on the function of                 dopaminergic systems in the primate and will be used to probe how normal         mechanisms for making decisions in the face of rewards can be disrupted in       addiction.                                                                        n/a",COMPUTATIONAL SUBSTRATES OF ADDICTION AND REWARD,6174750,R01DA011723,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' decision making', ' dopamine', ' drug addiction', ' electrophysiology', ' human subject', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' neural information processing', ' reinforcer']",NIDA,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2000,154327,-0.006319879715556911
"CONJUNCTIVE REPRESENTATIONS IN CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract)                              The goal of this work is to help clarify the contribution of the hippocampus to      memory by testing the implications of a recently-developed theoretical               framework for understanding the complementary roles of the hippocampus and           neocortex in learning and memory. This framework centers around a set of             principles derived from computational neural network models, and we have             instantiated it in a specific biologically-based model. Many prominent theories      of the hippocampus assume that it contributes to memory by storing conjunctive       representations of the features that make up a particular experience. However,       this idea is too general because there are a number of reports that animals          with severe damage to the hippocampus solve problems that require conjunctive        representations. The present model recognizes that the cortical system alone         can store stimulus conjunctions. However, it is posited that the hippocampal         and cortical systems differ along two important dimensions: (a) learning             rate-the hippocampal system rapidly stores conjunctions whereas the cortical         system learns more slowly, and (b) the task demands under which the two systems      are driven to develop conjunctive representations-the hippocampal system has a       natural bias to automatically store conjunctions just as a function of the           organism sampling the environment, whereas the cortex is not naturally biased        to store conjunctions, and only does so when forced to by the demands of a           problem (e.g., reinforcement contingencies). As implemented in the present           model, these ideas provide a good account of many phenomena in the literature.       By comparing rats with damage to the hippocampus and intact rats, and                conducting additional simulations, the goal is to evaluate the proposed              theoretical framework by testing its implications for: (a) when the hippocampus      will contribute to complex nonlinear discrimination problems, (b) understanding      how the hippocampus contributes to contextual fear conditioning, (c) the role        of the hippocampus in tasks where conjunctions are automatically learned versus      those where they must be learned to satisfy the contingencies of reinforcement,      and (d) how the hippocampus mediates what some call logical reasoning                (transitive inferences).

"Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery At the end of 2020, the IARPA MICrONS program will conclude with an automated reconstruction of all neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex, along with the neurons’ synaptic connectivity and calcium-imaged responses to video stimuli. We believe that this dataset could become the most widely used resource in the field of cortical circuits, but more work is required to realize this potential. We propose to create an online community called Pyr (pronounced “peer”) that takes the result of MICrONS as its starting point. We propose to detect and correct the remaining errors in the automated segmentation through automated algorithms and human proofreading working in tandem. Automated error detection and correction will utilize hand-designed heuristics as well as deep learning and deep metric learning. Proofreading will be crowdsourced to nonscientist volunteers, a concept pioneered by Eyewire, but updated to handle a 1000x larger dataset and far more accurate artificial intelligence. We expect that Pyr will generate more cortical connections than any previous study, by orders of magnitude. This information will be accompanied by calcium-imaged visual responses of 80,000 neurons. With such an enormous and rich dataset, the primary bottleneck will become scientific discovery. We propose to crowdsource discovery by assembling a community of researchers who collaborate with Pyr and each other. Discovery infrastructure will include a “Science API” that allows programmatic access to the primary and derived data through Python functions, an automated system for “materializing” the connectome that makes the result of proofreading available to researchers with essentially zero delay, and a versioning system will insure that analyses are reproducible. We will create a framework enabling the community to contribute their own kinds of annotations, which will be included in materialization. Finally, we will build interactive discovery tools that couple Science API queries with visualization. We envision a community of researchers who will build upon the above discovery infrastructure, creating and sharing analysis tools of their own. They will investigate diverse questions about cortical structure and function, including many that we cannot foresee at all. In the future, Pyr could incorporate other cortical datasets as they become available, with much less engineering effort than the original MICrONS dataset. As with MICrONS, software will be developed in the open in public github repos. This software could be reused by others to build systems similar to Pyr. This project will create Pyr, an online community that makes scientific discoveries about cortical structure and function by reconstructing and analyzing the connections between neurons in a cubic millimeter of mouse cortex along with the activity of the same neurons. Pyr will provide fundamental knowledge about normal function of the cortex, which is expected to be useful when studying mouse models of mental disorders.",Structure and Function of a Cubic Millimeter of Cortex: Crowdsourcing for Proofreading and Discovery,10025901,RF1MH123400,"['3-Dimensional', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Caring', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Continuing Education', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Educational workshop', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Mus', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Training', 'Update', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive load', 'connectome', 'crowdsourcing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'heuristics', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'microscopic imaging', 'millimeter', 'mouse model', 'online community', 'peer', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'tool', 'visual coding', 'volunteer']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,6000000,-0.026560378594772657
"SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In recent years, human cognitive auditory neuroscience has made rapid strides due to advances in human neuroimaging, the advent of innovative machine learning/big data analytic approaches, and a greater mechanistic understanding of cognitive-sensory interactions in animal models. The dynamic landscape of this emergent field necessitates a highly interdisciplinary, human and translation-centric symposium that brings together expertise across academia and industry. This application requests partial funding for the Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) to be hosted in Pittsburgh, PA in July 2020 and 2022, as a joint venture between Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). As a biennial meeting, SCAN aims to become the premiere intellectual and professional venue for current research in the emerging field of human cognitive auditory neuroscience. SCAN will incorporate elements typical to academic conferences (research talks, posters) as well as novel ideas that promote ‘blue sky’ thinking in this rapidly evolving field. SCAN will assiduously and innovatively work towards inclusivity and creating an atmosphere that encourages intellectual and professional engagement from women, underrepresented minorities, and individuals with disabilities. Another critical aim of the SCAN is to foster industry-academic partnerships with an eye towards translation of basic research and fostering career opportunities for trainees. Pittsburgh is uniquely situated to launch SCAN. With an enviable concentration of co-located auditory neuroscience expertise, Pittsburgh is also an intellectual hub for industries/start-ups engaged in in machine learning, natural language processing, and speech recognition. SCAN will leverage these advantages to foster growth and innovation tied to core missions of the National Institutes of Deafness and Communication Disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Symposium on Cognitive Auditory Neuroscience (SCAN) has a strong connection to deafness and communication disorders through its focus on the basic science of human cognitive auditory neuroscience, and its translation. SCAN will establish an intellectual home for dissemination of cutting-edge research in human cognitive auditory neuroscience, support the development of the next generation of scientists, build a vibrant and inclusive community that engages with the grand challenges in the field, and forge new academia-industry partnerships.",SYMPOSIUM ON COGNITIVE AUDITORY NEUROSCIENCE (SCAN),9914387,R13DC018243,"['Academia', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Animal Model', 'Atmosphere', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Ear', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Eye', 'Fertilization', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hearing', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Industry', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Joint Ventures', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Otolaryngology', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Speech', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'deafness', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interest', 'meetings', 'millisecond', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open data', 'posters', 'pressure', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'sound', 'speech recognition', 'symposium', 'virtual reality']",NIDCD,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R13,2020,36183,-0.0027716275031178434
"Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia Project Summary  In an effort to intervene before psychosis onset and prevent morbidity, a major recent focus in schizophrenia research has been the identification of young people during a putative prodromal period, so as to develop safe and effective interventions to modify disease course. Over the past decade, studies at Columbia and elsewhere have evaluated clinical high-risk (CHR) individuals across a wide range of cognitive processes to try to identify core deficits of schizophrenia evident before psychosis onset. Subthreshold thought disorder and impaired emotion recognition have emerged as profound deficits that predate, rather than follow, psychosis onset and thus may be indicators of schizophrenia liability, consistent with studies in other risk cohorts, including genetic high risk. Further, subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit are significantly correlated, suggesting shared neural substrates in temporoparietal regions.  This study aims to identify the neural mechanisms that underlie subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficit in 125 CHR individuals followed prospectively for psychosis outcome. CHR cohorts are enriched with early cases of schizophrenia, as 20-25% develop schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders within 1-2 years. CHR cohorts may be optimal for studying core characteristics of illness as they otherwise have low-level symptoms, less illness chronicity and minimum exposure to antipsychotics. 25 individuals with schizophrenia and 50 healthy volunteers are included for comparison.  Subthreshold thought disorder and emotion recognition deficits will be studied across behavioral, physiological and circuit levels. For thought disorder, we will use automated speech analysis approaches developed in collaboration with IBM to identify constituent impairments in semantics and syntax, and a listening task that elicits reliable activation in language circuits. Our automated machine-learning approach to speech analysis, informed by artificial intelligence, derives the semantic meaning of words and phrases by drawing on a large corpus of text, similar to how humans assign meaning to what they read or hear. Emotion recognition will be measured using standard tasks, naturalistic tasks with dynamic face stimuli and parametric face morph tasks that discriminate between perception and appraisal; task-related BOLD activity will be used to identify relevant circuits. Associations with basic sensory impairment will be tested, including novel auditory mismatch negativity paradigms. Resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) methods will be used for circuit-level analysis of language production and emotion recognition across stages of illness, to determine unique and shared substrates of these constructs in early schizophrenia. If successful, this proposal will identify neural targets for remediation of cognitive impairments. Project Narrative Schizophrenia is an important public health concern. Core characteristics of schizophrenia that predate psychosis onset include subtle thought disorder and profound deficits in recognizing emotions in others' faces and voices. This proposal will evaluate mechanisms underlying these language and social cognitive deficits through the use of neuroimaging, electrophysiology and automated speech analysis, in order to develop new preventive strategies for schizophrenia.  ",Thought disorder and social cognition in clinical risk states for schizophrenia,9920230,R01MH107558,"['Adolescence', 'Age', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive remediation', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Production', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Semantics', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Functioning', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'auditory processing', 'automated analysis', 'career', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'deviant', 'effective intervention', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'language impairment', 'language processing', 'natural language', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'phrases', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'social', 'social cognition', 'syntax', 'visual processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,676651,-0.04153201442407017
"Closing the loop on markerless object tracking Abstract/Summary Tracking the movements of objects and parts of objects - referred to as pose estimation - is critical for understanding the mechanisms underlying complex behavior. Characterizing dynamic behaviors of animals (and other systems) is central to many disciplines, including computer science, physics, ethology, kinesiology, and sports medicine. Here we focus on neuroscience, where linking brain activity to associated dynamic behaviors is critical for both understanding normal function as well as effects of injury, disease, or degeneration. Invasive methods for measuring behavior are highly accurate, but require placement of sensors that may themselves interact with behavior and which may be susceptible to deterioration or infection. Video provides a non-invasive approach to characterizing behavior over time. Extracting behavior from video streams has, historically, been a slow and laborious process. Recent work in machine learning and artificial neural networks (ANNs), though, has revolutionized this process, making the analysis of complex video far easier and more accurate. While these systems are highly flexible, they were not designed for real time use, meaning that large video files must first be stored to disk for subsequent analysis. This poses two problems that this proposal will attempt to address. First, there is significant cost and management challenges associated with storage of large video stores, forming a practical barrier for adoption of this important technology for characterizing behavior. Second, estimates related to behavioral state are not available in real time so they cannot be used to control the experiment. We will develop a research methodology for “closing the loop”, by taking the networks trained by an existing and highly successful markerless object tracking system (DeepLabCut) and optimizing them for real time inference. After the system is functional, verified, and benchmarked, it will be shared with the community through open source repositories. Project Narrative Understanding the neural basis underlying complex behavior requires careful analysis of the dynamics of moving objects. Recent advances in computer vision has greatly facilitated our ability to track objects from video, but these tools are currently limited to offline analysis. Here we propose to build a system that addresses this problem by “closing the loop” using real time inference to be freely shared with the public to enhance ongoing research across the neuroscience spectrum.",Closing the loop on markerless object tracking,10047656,R03MH123990,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Ethology', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Freezing', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Kinesiology', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Movement', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'haptics', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'sensor', 'time use', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,162500,-0.012053873210175533
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,9984554,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,384007,-0.022086905033240827
"Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use  Project Summary A reliable and valid automated system for quantifying human affective behavior in ecologically important naturalistic environments would be a transformational tool for research and clinical practice. With NIMH support (MH R01-096951), we have made fundamental progress toward this goal. In the proposed project, we extend current capabilities in automated multimodal measurement of affective behavior (visual, acoustic, and verbal) to develop and validate an automated system for detecting the constructs of Positive, Aggressive, and Dysphoric behavior and component lower-level affective behaviors and verbal content. The system is based on the manual Living in Family Environments Coding System that has yielded critical findings related to developmental psychopathology and interpersonal processes in depression and other disorders. Two models will be developed. One will use theoretically-derived features informed by previous research in behavioral science and affective computing; the other empirically derived features informed by Deep Learning. The models will be trained in three separate databases of dyadic and triadic interaction tasks from over 1300 adolescent and adult participants from the US and Australia. Intersystem reliability with manual coding will be evaluated using k-fold cross-validation for both momentary and session level summary scores. Differences between models and in relation to participant factors will be tested using the general linear model. To ensure generalizability, we further will train and test between independent databases as well. To evaluate construct validity of automated coding, we will use the ample validity data available in the three databases to determine whether automated coding achieves the same or better pattern of findings with respect to depression risk and development. Following procedures already in place for sharing databases and software tools, we will design the automated systems for use by non-specialists and make them available for research and clinical use. Achieving these goals will provide behavioral science with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes; and clinicians to improve assessment and ability to track change in clinical and interpersonal functioning over time. Relevance For behavioral science, automated coding of affective behavior from multimodal (visual, acoustic, and verbal) input will provide researchers with powerful tools to examine basic questions in emotion, psychopathology, and interpersonal processes. For clinical use, automated measurement will help clinicians to assess vulnerability and protective factors and response to treatment for a wide range of disorders. More generally, automated measurement would contribute to advances in intelligent tutors in education, training in social skills and persuasion in counseling, and affective computing more broadly. Narrative Observational methods of measuring affective behavior have yielded critical insights into emotion, socio-emotional development, and psychopathology. A persistent barrier to their wide application is that they are labor-intensive to learn and to use. Our interdisciplinary team of behavioral and computer scientists will develop and validate a fully automated system for measuring affective behavior from multimodal (face, gaze, body, voice, and speech) input for research and clinical use.",Automatic Multimodal Affect Detection for Research and Clinical Use ,9912818,R01MH096951,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Australia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Computers', 'Persuasive Communication', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Verbal Behavior', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Voice Quality', 'Work', 'affective computing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'conduct problem', 'deep learning', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent tutoring system', 'interpersonal conflict', 'multimodality', 'protective factors', 'psychological distress', 'shared database', 'social skills', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,581743,-0.024436616174321513
"Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo Project Summary Developing new methodological and analytical tools to address currently insurmountable experimental questions is crucial to the future of neuroscience. While recent advances in two-photon microscopy and activity sensors have revolutionized our understanding of the cellular and circuit basis of behavior, many barriers still exist that preclude fully exploring the molecular basis of these processes in vivo. This is an important question, as modulating synaptic strength is thought to underlie higher brain functions such as learning and memory, whereas synaptic degradation is observed in many neurological pathologies. Despite the clear significance of synaptic communication, a large-scale analysis of how synapses across the brain are distributed and change during learning has not been performed, mainly due to technical difficulties arising from the immensely complex nature of synaptic networks. Here, we present a suite of novel methodologies that breaks through these barriers. Our novel approach leverages CRISPR-based labeling of endogenous synaptic proteins, in vivo two-photon microscopy to visualize fluorescently tagged synapses in behaving animals, and deep-learning-based automatic synapse detection. Using these minimally invasive methods, we will be able to longitudinally track how the strength of millions of individual synapses change during learning. By developing and enabling new strategies to automatically detect and track vast numbers of synapses across entire brain regions, this pioneering approach has the potential to provide us with an unprecedented view of synapses in behaving animals, enabling new discoveries regarding how dynamic regulation of synaptic strength encodes learning and memory. Project Narrative This multi-disciplinary proposal leverages molecular labeling, machine learning, and in vivo microscopy to develop a suite of first-in-class tools to automatically detect synaptic plasticity in intact animals. By employing these novel tools we seek to explain how dynamic modulation of synaptic networks encodes learning and memory. Disruption of synaptic plasticity has been shown to be tightly associated with several neuropsychiatric diseases and the proposed research may reveal novel therapeutic approaches for several disorders including schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability and Alzheimer's disease.",Developing Molecular and Computational Tools to Enable Visualization of Synaptic Plasticity In Vivo,10009886,RF1MH123212,"['AMPA Receptors', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Investigation', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Silicon', 'Speed', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain volume', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'density', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'interest', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurological pathology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'open source', 'postsynaptic', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'synaptic function', 'tool', 'two photon microscopy']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,1757079,-0.013364328656910736
"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10024094,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'comorbidity', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,422740,-0.015344807227065821
"Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication. Rett Syndrome (RTT) is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by partial or complete loss of acquired spoken language, acquired motor skills and stereotypic hand movements. Mutations in X-linked gene methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), a chromatin remodeler and gene regulator, is the causative gene for typical RTT. RTT is hypothesized to be the result of altered synaptic connectivity and plasticity caused by abnormal experience-dependent synapse development and maintenance. However, few experimental paradigms have explored how synaptic plasticity in RTT is affected over time and physiological changes with cellular, circuit and behavioral level granularity. Using Mecp2-null and heterozygous mouse models, we have previously shown that MECP2 regulates the timing of experience-dependent plasticity in the adult auditory cortex in a learned maternal behavior paradigm. We found that Mecp2-heterozygous females (SurHet) were inefficient gatherers, likely due to atypical auditory perception, caused by an abnormal, transient increase in numbers of mature perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs are extracellular matrix structures that act as physical barriers for plasticity, and form predominantly around cortical parvalbumin GABAergic neurons. Major questions remain: Pup retrieval behavior is a complex sequence of events involving auditory, tactile, olfactory senses and goal-directed motor events. How do different sensory inputs (pup vocalizations, feel and smell of pups) contribute to the motor outputs (adult vocalizations, goal-directed search and carrying pups by mouth to the nest)? Our aims in this R15 proposal are to (1) characterize vocalizations/syllables and interactions between pups and adult females during pup gathering task, using integrated analysis of audio and video recordings with new machine learning algorithms; (2) identify the time line of altered PNN expression in piriform cortex, a brain region thought to be important for olfactory coding and a relay station for multisensory integration using immunostaining/imaging and then, surgical manipulations of piriform cortex. We hypothesize that expression of mature PNNs in the piriform cortex is regulated by MECP2 and contribute to proper integration and functioning of distinct components of pup retrieval behavior. The results from this study aims to identify novel circuits and mechanisms involved in multisensory integration of vocal communication during complex social behavior, which are one of the most striking yet underexplored phenotypes in RTT. Relevance to health: Rett Syndrome is diagnosed as a neurodevelopmental disorder with sensory, motor and social impairments; however, it is currently unknown where and how these impairments develop and change over time in adulthood. This proposal aims to understand how plasticity, the ability of the brain to incorporate and adapt to changes in its environment and surroundings, is affected by mutated genes in RTT and associated neurological disorders. Rett syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). The overall goal is to determine how MECP2 deficiency results in altered experience-dependent plasticity, critical for learning and navigating one's social environment, and to observed stereotypic RTT phenotypes.",Role of Piriform Cortex Perineuronal Nets in Mouse Social Communication.,10045956,R15MH124042,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Smell Perception', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Tactile', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Ultrasonics', 'Video Recording', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Work', 'chromatin remodeling', 'deep learning algorithm', 'differential expression', 'endophenotype', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'girls', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'middle age', 'motor control', 'mouse model', 'multisensory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'piriform cortex', 'programs', 'pup', 'sensory input', 'social', 'social cognition', 'social communication', 'stereotypy', 'undergraduate student', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R15,2020,450753,-0.028658182776943722
"Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies   Project Summary Decades of psychology research have shown that working memory is limited, and humans can only hold a few items in mind at the same time. However, cognitive tasks like planning and problem solving require access to many pieces of information at once. To overcome this constraint, we enlist mnemonic strategies, for instance grouping pieces of information into chunks, as we commonly do to remember telephone or social security numbers. Mnemonic chunking allows us to flexibly organize information on line, providing a fundamental building block for advanced cognitive abilities. Chunking impairments occur when damage or dysfunction involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), for instance in patients with schizophrenia, and severely compromises overall cognitive function. Thus, determining how the brain organizes information is a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms of advanced cognition, and how these go awry in disease states. A key challenge is that strategies for organizing information are self-generated and highly variable in a laboratory setting. A central innovation of this proposal is the novel computational approach used to identify spontaneous mnemonic chunking in macaque monkeys. This is critical because animal models allow us to interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools. Here, we will use high-density, multi-site recording and targeted neuromodulation to understand the circuit mechanisms that chunk mnemonic information. Previous theoretical work suggests that chunks arise from compressed working memory representations that act as neural shorthand, economizing on processing resources at the cost of degrading some original information. Neurons in dlPFC encode items in working memory, and their dynamics are shaped by recurrent interactions with the basal ganglia. Thus, we hypothesize that corticostriatal interactions promote the efficient reorganization of working memory that underlies chunking. To test this we will investigate dlPFC- striatal dynamics when monkeys spontaneously chunk information in a self-organized working memory task. We will record large numbers of single neurons and local field potentials, and dynamically decode representations held in working memory to assess how mnemonic codes and corticostriatal interactions change when items are or are not chunked. In addition, exogenous stimulation will test the causal role of striatal circuits in promoting the formation of mnemonic chunks. Together, these experiments will determine how the brain establishes mnemonic chunks to optimize working memory performance. This will shed light on a fundamental feature of advanced cognition, and how dysfunction in these mechanisms could give rise to disorders of thought and memory. Finally, understanding mechanisms that optimize cognitive function in a biological system may fuel creative advances that optimize performance in artificial intelligence systems.   Project Narrative This project focuses on understanding circuit dynamics in the prefrontal cortex that mediate mnemonic chunking, a critical strategy for improving working memory performance in advanced cognition. Specifically, we will assess how mnemonic information is bound together in the dynamics of frontal and striatal circuits, and whether these processes can be enhanced with targeted circuit modulation. Our results could provide insights into core deficits in cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, and open the door for novel approaches that enhance cognitive function in the setting of working memory deficits.",Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies,9862969,R01MH121480,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Security Number', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Work', 'behavior test', 'biological systems', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'density', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'memory recall', 'microstimulation', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,479816,0.008519309912665883
"Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation Project Summary This project’s long-term goal is a fuller understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of olfactory sensory adaptation that facilitate odor discrimination in the natural world. To confront the wide fluctuations in intensity and temporal variability that are characteristic of natural odor environments, animals have evolved refined neurosensory mechanisms for parsing behaviorally-relevant signals such as pheromones from background nuisance odors. This project seeks to elucidate how adaptive mechanisms in the olfactory periphery play a central role in this discrimination task. The project will utilize a novel behavioral assay that permits precise quantification of the logic used by insects in navigating complex, temporally dynamic odor environments. By combining this assay with data analytic methods and machine learning, a comprehensive lexicon of archetypal navigational strategies of insect odor navigation will be derived. Importantly, since both odors and insects can be simultaneously tracked in this assay, the project will uncover strategies employed by insects in not just static, but also fluctuating odor landscapes. By quantifying how these strategies modulate in time, the role of memory in shaping navigational strategies will also be determined. The project will then leverage this dictionary of navigational logic to quantify how various mechanisms of adaptation in Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons can shape odor discrimination. Importantly, this project will examine the role of olfactory sensory adaptation in an ethologically-relevant way, by connecting mechanisms that operate at the level of sensory input with neural computations that affect output behavior. Further, since the behavioral assay tracks complex odor environments simultaneous with freely-moving insects, the impact of behavior on future signal acquisition – behavioral feedback onto odor stimuli – is fully maintained. The behavioral experiments and data analysis in this project utilize the tractable, highly-characterized system of Drosophila melanogaster, in which a wealth of existing genetic tools will allow directed experimentation of specific adaptive mechanisms in olfaction. The results of this project will elucidate how insects effectively navigate complex odor environments, and how olfactory systems maintain sensitivity despite odor conflicts and temporal variability. Project Narrative This project will contribute to our understanding of how the olfactory sensory periphery and neural circuitry have evolved to effectively encode our vast and varied chemical environment. The project will help reveal how odor discrimination capability is maintained in natural odor landscapes, leading to practical interventional strategies for the control of disease vectors such as tsetse flies and mosquitos, who rely critically on their sense of smell to navigate. Chemical sensing is the only shared sensation among organisms as simple as bacteria and as complex as humans, and this project will enhance our fundamental knowledge of this universal sensory modality.",Quantifying the role of adaptation in olfactory coding through the logic of navigation,9868821,F32MH118700,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Cues', 'Culicidae', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Dictionary', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Vectors', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Insecta', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Left', 'Logic', 'Lymph', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Odors', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Olfactory Receptor Neurons', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pheromone', 'Photosensitivity', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tsetse Flies', 'Walking', 'analytical method', 'disorder control', 'environmental change', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'light intensity', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mutant', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurosensory', 'novel', 'odorant-binding protein', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIMH,YALE UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,69554,-0.0032232566770905623
"Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties Project Summary/Abstract The collective dynamics of the network of neurons in the brain drive its primary holistic function — control of organismal behavior. Pathologies of the nervous system that disrupt this coordinated activity result in dysfunctional patterns of motor output and gross behavior. However, it is unknown how patterns of coordinated activity arise from the properties of single neurons and their connections. In the next five years we seek to develop a rigorous theory and biologically realistic model of the emergence of coordinated dynamics in a complete network of neurons, similar to the current level of understanding of how the dynamics of interacting molecular species produce goal-directed motile behavior in single-cell bacteria. We focus on the relatively simple nervous system of C. elegans; with precisely 302 neurons, it is a natural choice for such fundamental neurodynamical studies. To attack this problem, the research in our lab utilizes a fusion of experimental and computational approaches including advanced microscopy, genomic engineering, machine learning based image processing, quantitative behavior, and dynamical systems analysis. We have developed novel approaches to quantitatively probe and characterize the signal processing properties of single neurons as well as record and quantify the activity of the entire C. elegans nervous system at single-cell resolution using volumetric calcium imaging under genetic perturbation. We are now exploring the relationship between the microscopic properties of cellular signaling and the macroscopic function of collective network dynamics. A mechanistic model of the composition and maintenance of structured, controlled brain dynamics would provide a framework for understanding how gross neurological disease states arise from cellular and molecular dysfunction. Project Narrative A basic theory and data driven model of the emergence of collective, coordinated network dynamics based on the properties of neurons is lacking. Such a theory would provide a framework for understanding how dysfunction at the cellular or molecular level leads to gross neurological disease states. The work proposed here will inform approaches and therapeutic targets to restoring healthy brain dynamics.",Emergence of Functional Network Dynamics from Single Cell Properties,9991858,R35GM124735,"['Bacteria', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Data', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motor output', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Work', 'base', 'cell motility', 'dynamic system', 'image processing', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel strategies', 'signal processing', 'theories', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R35,2020,396250,-0.024242775751728955
"Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The proposal responds to RFA-MH-16-510 by focusing on the domain of “Cognitive Systems” and constructs “cognitive control” and “working memory” and integrating units of analysis “brain circuit” and “behavior”. These constructs are subsumed under executive function (EF), the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals. Among pediatric psychiatric categories, EF deficits define Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and are comorbid with a variety disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders, disruptive behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, Tourette's/tics, and learning disabilities. Across these disorders, EF deficits limit adaptive functioning and success of behavioral intervention. Ameliorating EF deficits is a challenge, however, because current EF nosology falls short of capturing heterogeneity within and across disorders. The primary challenge then is identifying the dimensions of EF that capture the specific nature of impairment across disorders. Most past approaches utilize dimension- reducing methods that are sensitive to shared variance, but exclude unique variance. Here, we address this challenge through novel data-driven generation of behavioral profile-based EF dimensions derived from graph theory community-detection (following [1, 2]), applied to common clinical parent-report measures (ADHD Rating scale, inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, 8 Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function subdomains, Child Behavior Checklist internalizing, and externalizing). Community-detection applied to N=322 (8-13 yrs; IQ>70; no “medical” diagnosis) presenting at Children's National Medical Center neuropsychology clinics identified three EF profiles distinguished by deficits and relative strengths: 1) poor working memory; good flexibility and inhibition; 2) poor inhibition; good working memory; 3) poor flexibility and emotion regulation; good working memory. We will recruit from this growing cohort to examine: Aim 1 – seek replication by testing a new larger cohort with support vector machine classification trained on preliminary data. Aim 2 - characterize functional networks distinguishing the 3 profiles, by group comparison and dimensional analysis. Task-based functional connectivity will test hypothesis about specific circuits distinguishing the novel EF dimensions using fMRI during: 1) N-back working memory; 2) Response inhibition; and 3) Adaptive socio-emotional cognitive control. Task-free resting-state fMRI will test hypothesis about large-scale network interaction differences between EF dimensions. Aim 3 - test the hypothesis that the novel EF dimensions are associated with specific domains of adaptive function, mediated by specific functional networks. Results will: 1) provide neurobiologically validated EF dimensions for re- conceptualizing pediatric psychiatric nosology, and 2) identify treatment targets and increase precision in measuring treatment effects – i.e., who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response and outcome, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Problems with executive function, the ability to voluntarily constrain thoughts and actions in the service of goals are ubiquitous across psychiatric childhood disorders, but heterogeneity within and across diagnostic categories make them intractable, posing a major challenge for their amelioration. Using a novel data-driven method, we will generate dimensions of executive function that cut across disorders and identify underlying neural circuitry with task-based and task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging. Results will provide neurobiologically validated behavioral dimensions necessary for revising diagnostic criteria and aiding decisions about who should receive what treatment and how to best measure response, both of which are essential to the success of a personalized approach to clinical practice.",Characterization of executive function dimensions across pediatric psychiatric disorders,9949794,R01MH110512,"['13 year old', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disruptive Behavior Disorder', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mood Disorders', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Parents', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Tic disorder', 'Training', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive system', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparison group', 'dimensional analysis', 'disease classification', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'graph theory', 'inattention', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'teacher', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,385524,0.024940623991910493
"Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses As the population continues to age and rates of late-life cognitive impairment rise, early detection of cognitive impairment is increasingly important for the timely implementation of interventions and safety initiatives. This may be particularly important in individuals found to have high brain amyloid burden, putting them at particular risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) of the brain. Performance changes in challenging, complex, high-stakes daily activities, such as driving, and accompanying physiological responses may together provide an inexpensive avenue for early detection. This may serve the dual purpose of alerting individuals or health care providers to early cognitive impairment, as well as to potential safety issues. Sophisticated in-car technology that is increasingly becoming standard in new vehicles may provide the means to unobtrusively capture sensitive information about naturalistic driving behaviors and potentially assist with early detection of cognitive impairment. The proposed study will apply a novel approach to unobtrusively monitor older drivers in (a) naturalistic, (b) fixed course, and (c) simulator driving situations. Machine learning approaches will be used to select key features of driving behaviors and physiological measures of arousal in all driving scenarios and eye tracking measures from fixed and simulator drives to predict drivers’ clinical diagnosis: young adult drivers, healthy older drivers with and without high amyloid burden, and drivers with mild cognitive impairment with evident amyloid burden. The participants will be followed longitudinally in the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) with annual cognitive and neurological evaluations, as well as repeat driving and physiological testing at two years from baseline. Understanding and identifying changes in driving behaviors and how these predict who will develop clinically identifiable cognitive impairment will lead to the development of a model for early detection of cognitive decline and ADRD. This study will examine everyday driving behaviors and physiological measures obtained by in-car monitors during common driving situations (e.g., intersections, freeway ramps). The goal is to build a model that uses features from these in-car measures to detect small driving changes that may be the earliest indicators of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. Utilizing data gathered unobtrusively from vehicles is cost effective, readily available, and may alert individuals and health care providers of early cognitive concerns, as well as potential safety issues.",Identification of cognitive decline and dementia: Prediction by everyday driving behaviors and physiological responses,10044799,R01AG068338,"['Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amyloid', 'Arousal', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breathing', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Funding', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Rate', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language Development', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychology', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Ramp', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Skin Temperature', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cost effective', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'driving behavior', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel strategies', 'older driver', 'programs', 'psychological aspect of aging', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'response', 'smart watch', 'social', 'visual tracking', 'young adult', 'β-amyloid burden']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,1506851,-0.0481672184580012
"Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth Project Summary/abstract Public attention has often been drawn to the relationship between violence and mental health issues, but violent behavior is a very complex phenomenon undergirded by myriad social, psychological, environmental, and biological influences. This project intends to investigate these influences among a large sample of previously incarcerated youth, following up with them and collecting valuable longitudinal data. Our team worked with these youth and their families collecting detailed psychological, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures as part of a previous NIH-funded investigation. The current project aims to re-assess these individuals (now young adults) to examine long-range positive (i.e., desistance from drug use/antisocial behavior) and negative (relapse to drugs, antisocial behavior) outcomes. We will collect new neuroimaging scans, which combined with prior MRI data, will be useful for quantifying trajectories of change that map to persistence and desistence from externalizing outcomes. Advanced machine-learning approaches will be utilized in conjunction with structural, functional, network, and dynamic network brain measures in addition to behavioral and psychological measures. Machine learning approaches are capable of identifying patterns in high-dimensional data and delineating the unique combinations of variables that are most predictive of specific outcome variables. Using these methods, we intend to define neural mechanisms that predict outcomes. We also aim to identify combinations of variables that confer greater risk for persistent antisocial behavior and violence. The translational value of this work will be to clarify informative patterns of data that may indicate preventable outcomes. Furthermore, neural measures indicative of specific vulnerability will be identified as specific targets for treatment and novel intervention strategies. By identifying specific vulnerabilities and the changes that accompany positive outcomes, we will be closer to understanding the best way to recognize and prevent costly violent behavior. Project Narrative Recent attention has been drawn to the relationship between mental health issues and potentially preventable forms of violence, antisocial behavior, and substance abuse. This project aims to investigate neural, psychological, and life-course variables that may help predict divergent trajectories for persistent antisocial behavior and desistance by applying advanced statistical models in conjunction with longitudinal data from a unique sample of antisocial youth. Identifying variables that predict these outcomes will further help us to develop more efficacious treatment and intervention strategies.",Externalizing outcomes in high risk youth,9709107,R01HD092331,"['Academia', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Crime', 'Criminology', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Drug usage', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Family', 'Firearms', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Property', 'Psychological Factors', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Security', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'behavioral outcome', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'convict', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'developmental psychology', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'relating to nervous system', 'repeat offender', 'social', 'social factors', 'structured data', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,706182,-0.00029946827218942193
"Parsing Neurobiological Bases of Heterogeneity in ADHD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, with multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of symptoms, comorbidities, and long-term trajectories. An approach to parsing such heterogeneity is to move beyond symptom ratings toward clinically meaningful phenotypic measures that have well-theorized relations with neurobiological systems. This approach serves as the basis of the NIH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework. In the proposed study, we will explore attention in an attempt to understand heterogeneity within children with ADHD. Reaction time variability (RTV), an index of attention, is the cognitive correlate that typically demonstrates the largest effect size when comparing ADHD to non-ADHD children. However, while RTV is considered a robust correlate of ADHD, its etiology is unclear and individuals with ADHD themselves vary considerably on indices of RTV. Thus, first establishing the neurobiological basis for RTV and then exploring if it can be used to understand heterogeneity in ADHD is critical. The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unparalleled opportunity to examine disordered attention, as indicated by RTV, in a large sample of children recruited at ages 9 to 10 and followed longitudinally. ABCD measures include attentional tasks, diagnostic interviews, and extensive neuroimaging. At baseline, 1079 children in ABCD met diagnostic criteria for ADHD. We propose to utilize machine learning to explore the neurobiological basis of RTV using the entire ABCD neuroimaging sample (n=9,598). We will also explore heterogeneity within ADHD by identifying groups of individuals diagnosed with ADHD who are characterized by unique RTV and neuroimaging profiles. To establish the validity of these profiles, we will examine their association with functioning. Machine learning focuses on learning statistical functions from multidimensional data sets to make generalizable predictions about individuals; it allows for inferences at the level of the individual and is sensitive to subtly distributed differences. Thus, it is an ideal approach for deriving subject-level biomarkers. The first aim is to determine which neuroimaging data are associated with each reaction time variable derived from Gaussian, ex-Gaussian, and drift diffusion models. The second aim is to explore corresponding developmental trends in RTV and neuroimaging data. The third aim is to a) identify groups of ADHD subjects with similar attentional profiles and, b) explore the neurobiological signature of these attentional profiles using the data we derived in aim 1. The fourth aim is to examine the clinical correlates of empirically-determined attentional profiles. Conceivably, identifying mechanistic biomarkers of disordered attention reflected by RTV could refine pharmacological, cognitive, and behavioral interventions; this could lead to a higher probability of success for treatments directed toward that particular mechanism for individuals within specific ADHD subgroups. This work could also be relevant for disordered attention in other disorders characterized by high levels of RTV (e.g., Autism). PROJECT NARRATIVE Psychiatric disorders pose challenges to neurobiological analysis as they are complex, routinely co-occur, and are operationalized using behavioral symptoms. We propose to examine the neurobiological basis of reaction time variability in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study in order to explore heterogeneity in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

"Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition Project Summary The septohippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in multiple cognitive Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains, including memory, attention, anxiety, and sensorimotor processing. This circuit is comprised primarily of the medial septal nucleus (MSN), hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pharmacological and genetic models targeting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction within this circuit result in memory deficits, difficulty with attention, and social interaction impairments. Therefore, we are studying the relationship between MSN-mPFC- hippocampal oscillatory activity in NMDA receptor hypofunction models to better create treatments for disrupted theta and gamma oscillations which are altered in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be one such promising treatment modality for circuit disorders. This NIMH K08 Career Development Award will provide the necessary foundation for Darrin J. Lee, MD, PhD to pursue the development of novel DBS techniques for septohippocampal circuit disorders. The project and training plan are rooted in the electrophysiological and molecular underpinnings of NMDA receptor hypofunction, while concomitantly enabling the candidate to collaborate with and learn from his mentors and consultants. This program will enable him to supplement his current skillsets in areas where he has identified gaps in his knowledge base, including relevant research methodology, study design, machine learning, and structural connectivity. The proposed research will focus on 1) characterizing neural oscillations within the septohippocampal circuit in two complementary models of NMDA receptor hypofunction (pharmacological: chronic MK-801 administration and genetic: parvalbumin interneuron-selective NR1 knockout); 2) evaluating the cognitive effects of DBS in these rodent models, and 3) evaluating the relationship between electrophysiological biomarkers and behavior using machine learning. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of specific electrophysiological aspects of impaired brain function in septohippocampal circuit disorders and serve as a catalyst for a research program centered on neuromodulation for these disorders. Moreover, data collected, skills procured, and collaborations developed will enable Dr. Lee to seek R01 funding and obtain career independence. Taken together, the data collected, and training developed will ultimately facilitate development of an investigator with unique skills in service of ameliorating suffering caused by septohippocampal circuit disorders. Project Narrative Current treatments for psychiatric disorders with deficits in cognitive and emotional Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains have limited efficacy, necessitating more effective treatment strategies. Disorders with NMDA receptor hypofunction lead to septohippocampal circuit dysfunction and circuit-specific cognitive dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) alters focal and diffuse networks and has recently been posited as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. This project aims to evaluate the the role of electrophysiological networks involved in NMDA receptor hypofunction and utilize DBS to improve cognitive behavior.",Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition,10054745,K08MH121757,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'MK801', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Medial Septal Nucleus', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'N-methyl-D-glutamate', 'NR1 gene', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pacemakers', 'Parvalbumins', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'basal forebrain', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'effective therapy', 'functional restoration', 'genetic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prepulse inhibition', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'septohippocampal', 'skills', 'targeted biomarker', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K08,2020,196326,-0.004986744605070082
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,9980718,R01NS107357,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Experiments', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'direct application', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory recognition', 'memory retrieval', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'recruit', 'success', 'theories']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,356032,-0.02873926566300621
"Can fidgeting lead to enhanced attention and emotional regulation in adult ADHD? Fidgeting is a highly common behavior, with excessive fidgeting associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies from our laboratory (1) and colleagues (2) suggest physical movement can enhance cognitive performance in children with ADHD. Hyper-sensorimotor behavior may be related to impaired regulation of arousal in the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems (3). This project will assess if frequency and characteristics of sensorimotor behavior relates to cognitive and emotional response in adults with ADHD, in a fine-grained manner, unlike other studies. We will test if intrinsic fidgeting (Aim 1) and access to a specially designed fidget device (Aim 2) modulates behavioral and physiological response in cognitively and emotionally-demanding contexts. The hype of the commercially available Fidget Cube, its competitors and fidget spinners suggest it might, but there is no systematic evidence to inform consumers, a gap, we aim to fill. ADHD is a significant problem in adulthood, with estimates of 4.4% in the population (4). It is associated with higher rates of substance use disorders, traffic accidents and employment challenges and a national annual economic impact ranging from $143 to $266 billion (5). While overt hyperactivity is mostly associated with childhood, subtler, finer-grained frequent movements (e.g., leg movements, doodling, clicking objects, tapping) are highly common in adult ADHD. Little is known about the characteristics of fidgeting in adulthood or whether it can be harnessed to enhance self-regulation with the use of an external device. Our aims are as follows: Aim 1: Assess in a randomized controlled study if a) intrinsic fidgeting and b) use of a smart fidget device improves attention, working memory, processing speed and emotional regulation in adult ADHD; Aim 2: Identify specific touch characteristics associated with cognitive and emotional regulation in adult ADHD using behavioral coding and a prototype fidget ball (developed by Co-I Isbister) with embedded pressure sensors on the fidget surface transmitting real time data to a computer for data analysis; Exploratory Aim 3: Conduct a machine learning analysis of fidgeting behavior in relation to cognitive performance and emotional regulation to: 1) automate recognition of touch features present in fidgeting in adult ADHD; 2) correlate touch sequences with cognitive performance measures and; 3) recommend fidgeting strategies that should prove effective in a given situation. This project will build upon prior work by PI Schweitzer, with her expertise in ADHD, clinical translational research and cognitive neuroscience and Co-I Isbister, with expertise in computer science and engineering, who developed sensor-enabled, smart fidget devices with the goal of improving self-regulation of mood and attention (6-9); Co-I Shapiro (10) with machine learning expertise in analyzing fidgeting behavior. This project is highly responsive to NIMH Strategic Plan Objective 3 as it will inform researchers working to develop new interventions based on behavioral and physiological markers, tailored to the individual. This project will study how fidgeting relates to cognitive and emotional functioning in adults with attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It will determine, in a laboratory setting, whether movement and access to a “fidget device” providing sensory and motor stimulation can improve cognitive and emotional regulation (including on physiological measures) in adult ADHD. We will also acquire pilot data for machine learning analyses to be used in future, large scale studies to identify gestures and touch characteristics associated with improved cognitive and emotional regulation to see if we can predict and subsequently develop recommendations to improve performance and emotional control in natural settings (e.g., home, office, college classroom) for adult ADHD.",Can fidgeting lead to enhanced attention and emotional regulation in adult ADHD?,10064501,R21MH121901,"['Accidents', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Boredom', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Emotional Stress', 'Employment', 'Engineering', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leg', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microprocessor', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Readability', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Taxes', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Toy', 'Traffic accidents', 'Translational Research', 'Update', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'alertness', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'college', 'computer data analysis', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'economic impact', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'mood regulation', 'noradrenergic', 'novel', 'pressure sensor', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'randomized controlled study', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensorimotor system', 'social relationships', 'success', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2020,417969,0.018312823070899893
"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is a heterogeneous condition with varying degrees of severity and different etiologies that contrib- ute to variability in course trajectory and psychosocial functioning. About a third of adolescents with depression exhibit manic symptoms and as such, this substantially increases the risk for psychosocial impairment and sui- cidality. Yet, few studies have examined the pathophysiology of manic symptoms in adolescent depression and how alterations in key neural systems may be associated with changes in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. This project will address this important gap by employing a dimensional approach and a longitudi- nal design to examine neural, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral substrates of manic symptoms in (non- bipolar) depressed adolescents. Given evidence that manic symptoms implicate dysregulation of emotion and behavior, the current project will test the overarching hypothesis that alterations in connectivity of fronto- striatal-limbic (FSL) circuitry underlying cognitive control of positive emotion and reward and associated altera- tions in RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures of functioning in Cognitive and Posi- tive Valence Systems could differentiate depressed adolescents with from those without co-occurring manic symptoms. We aim to test this model in a longitudinal study of 180 mid-/post-pubertal adolescents (12-17 years old), including 140 adolescents with clinically significant depressive symptoms varying in manic symp- toms and 40 age- and sex- matched healthy youth. In accordance with the NIMH RDoC initiative, all depressed adolescents will be recruited from treatment settings based on the presence of clinically significant depression symptoms, irrespective of their categorical depressive disorder diagnosis. The project includes at baseline: a) fMRI paradigms measuring functioning of FSL circuitry associated with cognitive control of positive emotion and reward, b) resting state and diffusion tensor imaging, and c) out-of-the scanner neurocognitive tasks (e.g., approach-avoidance). RDoC domain-related emotional (e.g., elated mood), cognitive (e.g., delay discounting), and behavioral (e.g., impulsivity) functioning and levels of arousal will be assessed using a multi-method ap- proach (e.g., computer tasks in the lab and ecologically-valid web-based mood and actigraphy measures) at baseline and repeated bi-annually over 2 years post-scan. In addition, using machine learning algorithms, ex- ploratory analyses will be performed to identify patterns of baseline neuroimaging data and trajectories of RDoC domain-related (emotional, cognitive, behavioral) measures that can predict levels of mood symptoms and functional impairment at 2 years. Findings from this study could help distinguish subgroups of depressed adolescents based on brain-behavioral relationships, improve early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth, and inform personalized interventions (e.g., antidepressant vs. mood-stabilizer, type of psychotherapy). PROJECT NARRATIVE Early identification of manic symptoms (e.g., impulsive and risk taking behavior, mood lability) and its trajectories can decrease the huge and chronic burden of depressive disorders on youth, families, and society. This pro- posed longitudinal study has the potential to identify neural and behavioral markers of manic symptoms in de- pressed adolescents (without bipolar disorder). Identifying such markers has important clinical implications such as improving early detection of manic symptoms in depressed youth and informing personalized interventions for depression with mixed features (e.g., antidepressant versus mood-stabilizer or tailoring psychotherapeutic ap- proaches).  ",Positive Valence Systems and Manic Symptom Trajectories in Adolescent Depression,9812223,R01MH111600,"['17 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anisotropy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Computers', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Depressive disorder', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Label', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood stabilizers', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Online Systems', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positive Valence', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Process Assessment', 'Psychotherapy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'discounting', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mood symptom', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'pleasure', 'positive emotional state', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,687420,0.007118015544033888
"Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding Project Summary Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre- clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females and was predictive of improved extinction retention. A better understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We propose here to define the neural circuitry that drives the selection of conditioned darting vs. freezing, and how that integrates with known extinction circuits to promote extinction retention. Our preliminary data implicate the infralimbic cortex (IL) in this role, and we will use pharmacological, chemogenetic, and viral techniques to probe how descending IL projections to the dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray (PAG) may mediate a strategic switch between active and passive responding and drive long-term behavioral flexibility through putative collaterals in the amygdala. We will then use sophisticated machine vision and machine learning-based tools to define the broader behavioral repertoires within which darting exists, thereby identifying a multifaceted phenotype that could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability. Project Narrative Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the risk factors that promote disease susceptibility may be distinct in men and women. This project explores the neurobiological basis of divergent (active vs. passive) fear responses in males and females, which could help identify novel ways to prevent or treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding,10033671,R01MH123803,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Crete', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dorsal', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FOS gene', 'Female', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Rattus', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sex Differences', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'male', 'men', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress resilience', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,503268,0.0033116417580565435
"The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The cerebral cortex mediates all of human and animal cognition, encompassing a diverse set of abilities including sensation, perception, decision making, and motor planning. Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. A major obstacle both to understanding normal behaving and to treating pathology is the high degree of complexity of cortical circuitry, which has remained largely enigmatic. The conventional view of neocortex has been that sensory processing begins in layer 4 (L4), which was identified a century ago as the principal target of thalamic axons carrying information from our sensory organs. Sensory transforms are widely believed to occur as excitation spreads serially along the densest axonal pathways (thalamus→L4→L2/3→L5/6). Recently we discovered that the cerebral cortex, rather than being a monolithic structure, may contain two entirely separate processing systems, activated by the same signals arising from the thalamus. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two distinct “strata” of cortex in parallel.  This proposal's goal is to identify the behavioral and computational roles of the upper (L2-4) and lower strata (L5/6) as well as the interactions between them. We will investigate the behavioral roles of these layers in the mouse whisker system. Specific layers will be optogenetically disrupted in a series of tactile behavioral tasks, in which task complexity is progressively increased. Interlaminar interactions will also be studied by recording electrophysiologically from specific layers during behavior and using novel machine learning techniques designed to identify the type of computation performed in different levels of “deep networks”. The dimensionality of the representation in a layer will be estimated under normal behaviors and when specific layers are inactivated.  Identifying fundamental functions of upper versus cortical layers will likely pave the way for future studies in other neocortical systems and in higher-order species. Moreover, as the different layers contain molecularly and biophysically distinct cell types and project to distinct downstream targets, specific neurological disorders may involve dysfunction of specific pathways, cell types, and layers. Establishing the behavioral and computational roles of these elements may contribute to development of targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Dysfunctions of the cerebral cortex are thought to underlie numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the behavioral and functional roles of cortical layers and cell types are unknown. Identifying the contributions of specific cortical layers to normal circuit function will lead to better treatment of pathological conditions.     ",The behavioral functions of upper and lower cortical layers,9914374,R01NS094659,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Esthesia', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Organ', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Physiology', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tactile', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'biophysical properties', 'cell type', 'design', 'expectation', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'object shape', 'optogenetics', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatial integration', 'targeted treatment']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,350000,0.019566413769669028
"CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics A key computation that all mammals perform is determining the value of different outcomes. People and animal models evaluate outcomes as gains or losses relative to an internal reference point, likely  reflecting their experience-based expectations. For example, if someone is told they will receive a particular salary at a new job, but when they start, they find that the salary is substantially less, they will view that salary (which is a net increase in wealth) as a loss relative to their reference point. Reference  dependence is a consequential, ubiquitous phenomenon, driving decisions about insurance, financial products, labor, and retirement savings. The proposed work seeks to uncover how large populations of neurons represent a cognitive variable –the reference point- during value-based decision-making. This work involves complementary, synergistic interactions between experimentalists and theorists in the labs  of Dr. Christine Constantinople and Dr. Cristina Savin, respectively.  This proposal will develop a novel behavioral paradigm for studying reference dependence in rats, enabling application of powerful tools to monitor large-scale neural dynamics. High-throughput behavioral training will generate dozens of trained subjects for experiments in parallel. We will also develop a  behavioral model to quantify key aspects of rats' behavior, including individual differences in behavior across animals (Aim 1). We will use new silicon probes with high channel counts (“Neuropixels” probes) to record from populations of neurons in dozens of rats during behavior. Recordings will be obtained from  the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), a key brain structure implicated in value-based decision-making. We will develop novel latent dynamics models that will infer the reference point directly from populations of simultaneously recorded neurons in OFC, without any knowledge of the task or rats' behavior. This model will also be able to identify aspects of neural dynamics that are common across dozens of rats, and  aspects that are variable across animals, reflecting individual differences in behavior (Aim 2). Finally, we  will use complementary, state-of-the-art machine-learning techniques to train recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on our behavioral and neural data. This approach will generate concrete hypotheses about the  neural circuit architectures performing reference-dependent subjective valuation in our task (Aim 3). Decision-making is disrupted in psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia & bipolar disorder.Moreover,  all major classes of psychiatric disorders are associated with disordered reward processing in the brain.  Therefore, a circuit-level understanding of how the brain computes and represents the reference point  during value-based decision-making has enormous consequences for human health, and may hold  promise for improving treatments for mental health disorders in which decision-making is impaired.",CRCNS: Inferring reference points from OFC population dynamics,10153974,R01MH125571,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Birds', 'Brain', 'Capuchin Monkey', 'Choice Behavior', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Theory', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Population', 'Population Dynamics', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Retirement', 'Rewards', 'Savings', 'Schizophrenia', 'Silicon', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Wages', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral economics', 'dynamic system', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'preservation', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'tool']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,337222,0.006350499500124811
"Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making ABSTRACT Evaluating risk and reward potential in the execution of motivated behaviors is important in decision-making. Positive valence systems in the brain encode positive stimuli and play a key role in motivation, reward expectance, and appetitive behavior. Negative valence systems, on the other hand, encode negative stimuli such as fear and anxiety, and drive avoidance. Critically, an imbalance in these valence systems is thought to underlie many core symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Recent studies have shown that the brain regions responsible for encoding these divergent valence systems have anatomical and functional overlap. This raises the hypothesis that differences in network-level activity involving these overlapping areas may discriminate information of positive and negative valence. Here, I propose to employ in vivo recordings of electrical activity across multiple brain regions concurrently as mice perform a behavioral task designed to probe both reward and aversion. This task, modeled after the classic elevated plus maze and sucrose preference tasks, will directly quantify the impact of anxiogenic stimuli on reward-motivated behavior. Using machine-learning techniques, I will then generate neural models that reflect the network-level activity engaged during the performance of this task. I anticipate that this strategy with discover an independent network that corresponds with the positive valence system, and another independent network that corresponds with the negative valence system. I also anticipate that I will discover a network that directly integrates network-level activity in these two systems to drive decisions making. Lastly, the structure of these networks will be validated in a cohort of mice that will be subjected to chronic social defeat stress. A validated model of MDD, chronic social defeat stress induces increased anxiety-like phenotypes and decreased reward drive in a subset of mice (stress-susceptible mice) while only increasing anxiety-like phenotypes in other animals (stress-resilient mice). Thus, successful completion of the proposed work will lead to a network-level understanding of positive and negative valence systems. Furthermore, the framework discovered through this study has the potential to facilitate the development of new revolutionary approaches for diagnosis and treatment of MDD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Network Dynamics of Negative and Positive Valence Systems in Decision Making Valence systems in the brain are responsible for encoding the response to positive and negative experiences. Altered interaction between positive and negative valence systems may play a role in the maladaptive behaviors observed in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Using in vivo recordings of electrical activity across key brain regions, we will uncover how the brain encodes reward and punishment at the network level.

"ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES Specific Aims: Anxiety and depressive disorders are common, comorbid, and challenging to treat, ranking them among the greatest contributors to human suffering. An early-life extreme inhibited or anxious temperament, characterized by behavioral inhibition and extreme physiological responses to novel and/or potentially threatening contexts, is among the strongest predictors of the later development of anxiety and depressive disorders. Understanding the neurobiology of this early-life risk will identify treatment targets and provide a unique opportunity to develop scientifically founded behavioral and pharmacological interventions to treat and prevent stress-related psychopathology. Here, we propose a prospective longitudinal study in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to understand how inborn risk-factors and early-life inhibition lead to anxiety and maladaptive social behavior during adolescence and early adulthood. We will do this by leveraging the resources at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), including previous early-life assessments of behavioral inhibition, a multi-generational family pedigree, and large outdoor housing, alongside cutting-edge tools and analysis techniques, including multimodal neuroimaging and neural network-based animal tracking and behavioral analyses. We will use a prospective longitudinal design, and select 176 NHPs (88 F) previously phenotyped for early-life inhibition (3-4 months old) from the CNPRC’s large, multi-generational family pedigree. To study the emergence of anxiety- and depression-like symptomatology, half of the NHPs will be ""adolescents"" and half will be ""young adults"". We will perform in-lab behavioral and neuroimaging assessments, and longitudinal large-scale monitoring as animals navigate the entirety of their socio-geographic environment. First, we will examine how heritable-risk and early- life inhibition contribute to maladaptive socio-emotional behaviors in ecologically-valid contexts during adolescence and early adulthood (Aim 1). Starting in puberty, the risk for anxiety disorders is greater for girls than boys. Therefore, we also aim to demonstrate adolescent and young-adult sex differences in anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 2). To understand how these factors are mediated by alterations in relevant brain circuitry, including the extended amygdala, each animal will undergo multimodal structural and functional neuroimaging assessments. Using these data, we will test specific hypotheses regarding the extent to which extended amygdala circuits link early-life inhibition to the progression of anxiety- and depression-like behaviors (Aim 3). This combination of approaches promises to provide unprecedented insight into the neural substrates of maladaptive socio-emotional behavior during the transition to adulthood. PROJECT NARRATIVE A key challenge for psychiatry and clinical psychology is to discover, understand, and ultimately treat the root causes of the most common mental illness, including anxiety and depressive disorders. This project will harness an innovative combination of longitudinal measures and state-of-the-art tools—including a multi-generational pedigree, brain imaging, and deep neural networks—to objectively identify and prioritize the pathways that contribute to maladaptive social behavior as individuals mature into adults. This proposal promises to identify new treatment targets for the prevention of stress-related psychopathology.",ORIGINS AND EMERGENCE OF MALADAPTIVE SOCIOEMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR DURING THE TRANSITION TO ADULTHOOD IN PRIMATES,10051127,R01MH121735,"['5 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brothers', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Code', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Depressive disorder', 'Development', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Heritability', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Inherited', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Primates', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Puberty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Environment', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxiety-like behavior', 'anxious temperament', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'biobehavior', 'boys', 'brain circuitry', 'child depression', 'comorbidity', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'depressive symptoms', 'emerging adult', 'emotional behavior', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genetic pedigree', 'girls', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'mature animal', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'preadolescence', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2020,100000,-0.024814353728467367
"Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention PROPOSAL SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sustained attention – the continuous allocation of cognitive resources to respond to infrequent but behaviorally relevant stimuli – is impaired in many psychiatric disorders and represents an important aspect of cognitive control. Sustained attention requires top-down control and engagement with the external world, which is linked to both frontoparietal and thalamic controlling signals on primary sensor cortices. Despite the extensive behavioral characterization of sustained attention in animal models using the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), very little is known about the oscillatory interaction between the dorsal attention network and thalamo-cortical dynamics and its potential as a stimulation target for enhancing sustained attention. The objective of this project is to dissect the causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic stimulation. I will focus on three regions in the visual thalamo-cortical network: higher-order visual thalamus (lateral aspect of lateral posterior nucleus, LPl), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and primary visual cortex (V1). I will test the central hypothesis that LPl-cortical theta (4-7 Hz) functional connectivity causally coordinates PPC-V1 functional connectivity to facilitate sustained attention. The rationale of this work is that the proposed temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetic perturbations will directly test the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention. Accordingly, the two specific aims are: (1) Delineate the functional role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention, (2) Determine the causal role of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity in sustained attention via temporally-precise rhythmic optogenetics. This work is significant because it will causally test a convergent model in which higher-order visual thalamus coordinates the parietal top-down control signals onto visual cortex that is crucial for developing circuit- based therapies to enhance sustained attention. The work is innovative due to its integration of closed-loop optogenetics circuit interrogation, multisite electrophysiology, freely-moving sustained attention task, and machine-learning tools for the investigation of the causal role of oscillatory synchronization. The overall positive impact of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive map of how the higher-order visual thalamus interacts with the frontoparietal control signal to modulate V1, and thus mediates sustained attention, a transdiagnostic cognitive function that shows impairment in many psychiatric disorders including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. The implication of this study is that it may reveal a general mechanism underlying the interaction between two higher-order processing structures signaling to lower sensory cortices during cognitive processing. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sustained attention enables us to focus our cognitive resources on an activity for a prolonged period of time, and when impaired causes profound deficits in both cognition and behavior. Sustained attention is modulated by the thalamo-cortical rhythms. The research generated in this proposal will investigate (1) what oscillatory feature in the higher-order thalamo-cortical circuit is crucial for sustained attention, and (2) how the temporally- precise enhancing or disrupting of a thalamo-cortical oscillatory feature alters the functional connectivity in the circuit and behavioral outcomes mediated by sustained attention.",Causal role of higher-order thalamo-cortical oscillations in sustained attention,9970165,F31MH118799,"['Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Attentional deficit', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Exhibits', 'Ferrets', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Impulsivity', 'Investigation', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Lateral posterior nucleus of thalamus', 'Length', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area striata', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'functional disability', 'innovation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'sensory cortex', 'signal processing', 'sustained attention', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2020,37032,-0.03384675367415293
"Impaired Astroglial Glutamate Signaling in Rett Syndrome ABSTRACT  Rett syndrome (RTT) is a leading cause of severe intellectual disability in women. Individuals with RTT develop  typically  until  6-­18  months,  when  autism-­like  behaviors  as  well  as  deficits  in  purposeful  hand  use  and  speech  start to develop. Loss-­of-­function mutations in the X-­linked transcriptional regulator methyl-­CpG-­binding protein   2 (MECP2) occur in >95% of RTT cases. Initially, MeCP2 deficiency in neurons was considered as the exclusive  cause of RTT, but recent studies have revealed that glial cells lacking functional MeCP2 also have a significant  pathological role in RTT etiology. However, specific cellular mechanisms of glial cell dysfunction underlying this  role  or  its  behavioral  consequences  have  not  been  identified.  In  this

"Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing public awareness has accompanied recent scientific progress understanding the relationship between mental illness and some forms of persistent antisocial behavior. This has incited calls for research into possible interventions and preventive measures. A critical barrier to research in this arena has been an outdated, descriptive taxonomy of psychiatric constructs with overlapping symptomatology and little integration of emerging knowledge from neuroscience research. An array of traits and symptoms characterized within the framework of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology are features of several psychiatric constructs common in forensic settings. It will be essential for continued progress to identify basic features of pathology that are closely aligned with specific neurobiological systems underlying domains of cognitive processing. Among these, systems governing social processing, including emotion-related cognition and perspective-taking are particularly relevant in antisocial outcomes due to psychopathology. Our research team has previously explored the domains of social-affective processing as they relate to psychopathic traits in a large, forensic male sample. Here we propose to extend this work in a female forensic sample. Further, we integrate a wider array of dimensional constructs of pathology in socio-affective processing by examining features of psychopathic traits as well borderline personality disorder.  Our research strategy utilizes functional magnetic resonance imaging for the investigation of neural circuits involved in dynamic facial affective processing, inferring affective states from social situations, and emotional perspective-taking. These data will provide us with essential information about gender differences in these processes, and whether critical features of pathology are uniquely related to variation in these circuits. Furthermore, we will examine the utility of variation within these circuits to predict poor behavioral outcomes of interest including antisocial behavior, substance abuse, and suicide. Importantly, to determine key features predictive of poor outcomes, we plan to compare traditional hierarchical modeling procedures with more advanced data-driven approaches. Traditional approaches utilize regions of interest identified through prior neuroimaging work, combined with psychological traits of interest and other key demographic variables. Advanced data-driven approaches utilize Independent Component Analysis for determining key functional networks of brain activity, and utilize machine learning approaches for selecting features essential for building appropriate models. Comparing these approaches will inform our planned future efforts for developing remediation strategies and evaluating efficacy at both a neurological level as well as behavioral level. These are essential, incremental steps toward a larger translational goal to develop improved, targeted treatment strategies informed by emerging neuroscience. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Public and scientific attention alike has been increasingly engaged by the relationship between some varieties of persistent antisocial behavior and treatable mental health issues. With recent large-scale research initiatives in forensic settings, we have begun to understand the disrupted neural mechanisms involved in abnormal social and emotional processes in the severely antisocial, and it is imperative to extend this work in female samples in order to better understand gender differences. With an ultimate goal of developing more effective, targeted treatment strategies, this work addresses a major public health issue in an underserved and understudied population.",Socioemotional processing in female offenders - Resubmission 01,9889999,R01MH109329,"['AODD relapse', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affective', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antisocial Personality Disorder', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Face Processing', 'Female', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Personality', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive measure', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopath', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Structure of superior temporal sulcus', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Sulcus', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'falls', 'gender difference', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'male', 'mental state', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'offender', 'psychologic', 'psychopathic personality', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'remediation', 'response', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social situation', 'specific biomarkers', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,680053,-0.01859833028661906
"Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Working memory (WM), the cognitive entity that allows for temporary storage and manipulation of informa- tion, is crucial for much of what gives life subjective meaning, and enables an individual to participate in larger society. This includes following a conversation, finding a supermarket item, planning, driving, learning new skills—most anything that requires holding in mind information from long-term memory and/or sensory input for use requires WM. As a result, WM dysfunction has devastating effects, and regrettably, millions—individuals with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, dementia, and more—experience varying degrees of WM impairment, which is almost totally treatment resistant. Given its role in neurocognitive health and disease, understanding the mechanisms of WM is imperative. Correspondingly, this project will explore in depth the circuit basis for WM.  The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be a primary orchestrator of WM, processing input from other brain regions for WM instantiation. In spatial working memory (SWM), a WM subdomain regularly studied across species, interactions of the PFC with the ventral hippocampus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) are considered essential, with PFC-MD interactions undergirding neural maintenance of WM content and subsequent action selection. Notably, the PFC is quite heterogeneous, being composed of layers that differ both in their cellular composition and in their connectivity. Yet the possibility that these laminar subregions might uniquely contribute to the multifaceted ways in which the PFC empowers WM is only now being explored: recent studies suggest that superficial PFC layers support WM content maintenance, while deep PFC layers support post-maintenance action selection. This proposal expands upon these studies by using novel technology to explore cellular-resolution laminar representations in WM.  Specifically, this proposal examines what WM content is encoded in the activity of individual cells vs. popula- tions in the different PFC layers (Aim 1) and assesses the dependence of these laminar WM representations on input from the MD (Aim 2). To do so, calcium imaging will be performed through microendoscopes in mice genetically and surgically specified to express calcium indicators in particular PFC layers. These mice will perform a trial-based delayed nonmatch to sample WM task in a custom-built, automated 8-armed radial maze, and for Aim 2 will have MD input to the PFC optogenetically silenced during behavior and imaging (to simulate the MD-PFC hypoconnectivity regularly observed in those with WM deficits). Finally, for rigorous mapping of behavior to neural activity, novel machine learning behavioral classification paradigms will be used.  WM provides the cognitive building blocks for the very fabric of quotidian life—sustaining social relationships, maintaining a job, living independently, learning new things and more. Given such complexity, detailed interrogation of WM circuit mechanisms is required. Accordingly, this proposal uses emerging technologies to explore circuit mechanisms of both WM function and dysfunction, advancing pursuits of therapeutic innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Working memory, the cognitive entity through which information can be temporarily held in mind for processing, is fundamental to many essential human activities, from holding a conversation, to walking home from the bus stop, to introspecting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been known to undergird working memory, with information maintenance empowered by input from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), but how the different PFC layers support this complex and versatile capability remains largely unclear. This proposal will assess the neural representations in PFC layers during spatial working memory, and how they depend on MD input, to better establish circuit mechanisms for working memory instantiation, to the end of moving us closer to eventual therapies for the millions affected by working memory impairment.",Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze,10067892,F31MH124323,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Critical Thinking', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medial', 'Medial Dorsal Nucleus', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Mind', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opsin', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Supermarket', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Textiles', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'arm', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'empowered', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'long term memory', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'microendoscope', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'self-directed learning', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social relationships', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2020,45520,0.00023357275662295605
"Mapping connectomes for disordered emotional states PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our objective is to use HCP protocols to acquire and make public a large dataset of imaging, behavioral, and symptom data from patients with disordered emotional states. We will also develop and make public new methods for examining how connectome disorganization gives rise to these disordered states at the level of the individual patient. Psychopathology arising from enhanced negative emotion or from the loss of positive emotional experience affects over 400 million people globally. Such states of disordered emotion cut across multiple diagnostic categories and are compounded by accompanying disruptions in cognitive function. Not surprisingly, therefore, these forms of psychopathology are a leading cause of disability. To address these issues our investigative strategy is informed by the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative spearheaded by NIMH. We focus on three RDoC domains and constructs: 1) acute threat within the Negative Valence System (NVS) domain, a construct relevant to automatic reactions to fear and physical symptoms of anxiety; 2) reward valuation and responsiveness within the Positive Valence System (PVS) domain, a construct involving incentive salience, hedonic responses and symptoms of anhedonia; and 3) working memory within the Cognitive System (CS) domain, a construct that implicates top-down regulation of cognitive rumination and worry. Our approach is grounded in strict adherence to HPC protocols and a strong commitment to data sharing. We unite complementary expertise, including (1) state-of-the-art MRI technology and data management systems; (2) a field-leading Center for Reproducible Neuroscience; (3) a track record in leading large-scale neuroradiology consortia; (4) leaders in RDoC-informed approaches to large-scale imaging in depression and anxiety; and (5) pioneering statistical approaches for high-dimensional data. Our aims are to (1) use the HCP protocols to acquire multi-modal data for 300 people aged 22-25 years of age who are experiencing varying degrees of acute threat, loss of reward valuation/responsiveness, and difficulties in working memory, (2) elucidate the nature of the relations among connectomes, symptoms, and behavior based on networks related to the RDoC constructs of interest, and (3) to develop data-driven, machine-learning methods to discover how connectomes for these constructs combine together to form naturally organized clusters of people. Our data will advance a neurobiological model that maps network dysfunctions to specific behaviors and symptoms. This model will provide a foundation for ultimately guiding more classifications and treatment choices according to types of neural dysfunction rather than relying on diagnostic categories that are agnostic to neurobiology.

"Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans Chronic dysregulation of physiological systems manifests systemically as allostatic load (AL) and in abnormal stress reactivity profiles, which are features of psychopathological conditions that increase future disease risk. But the biological basis underlying inter-individual differences in stress regulation and reactivity remains unknown. Even among populations of healthy individuals exposed to standardized laboratory challenges, such as the Trier social stress test (TSST), there are substantial differences in the magnitude of responses in multiple physiological systems, including but not limited to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and cardiovascular system, metabolic changes, and immune and pro-inflammatory systems. One common factor to all stress systems is their dependence on energy supply, which fuels every aspect of the stress response including molecular, cellular, systemic and cognitive/psychological functioning. At the cellular level, energy is provided by mitochondria, unique organelles that populate the cell cytoplasm and contain their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that is essential to mitochondrial health. MtDNA defects cause dysregulation of multiple aspects of mitochondrial structure and function, known as mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL). Three main lines of evidence suggest that MAL contributes to AL and regulates stress responses in humans: i) we recently discovered that the mtDNA is released following psychological stress in humans (PNEC 2019), ii) experimentally-induced MAL in animals caused specific alterations in the multisystem physiological responses to psychological stress (PNAS 2015), and iii) mitochondria are the source of stress hormones, including cortisol that is synthesized in mitochondria within the adrenal glands (Nat Genetics 2012). Together, this evidence suggests that MAL may alter both baseline AL and stress reactivity profiles, potentially providing new insight into the source of interindividual differences in stress regulation and health in general. In this project, we perform the first comprehensive assessment of MAL, systemic AL, multisystem stress reactivity to a laboratory challenge (TSST) in three groups of individuals who have rare genetic mtDNA defects that selectively causes different forms of MAL and in a healthy control group. Multisystem stress biomarker profiling under fasting baseline and stress reactive conditions will provide a comprehensive test of pathways linking MAL to stress physiology in humans. The resulting high-dimensionality data will be treated using integrative data analytic approaches and classifying algorithms, including cross-validated machine learning models, to identify resting and stress-reactive biomarker signatures responsive to MAL. In parallel, assessments of executive function and key domains of psychosocial functioning including mood, stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and well-being will contribute to provide a comprehensive picture of novel mitochondrial psychobiological pathways. NARRATIVE There are large unexplained inter-individual differences in systemic allostatic load and stress reactivity, which may in part be explained by mitochondria. Here we study the effects of chronic dysregulation of mitochondrial function – mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL) – on multisystem stress regulation in humans. This project will establish the influence of MAL on baseline AL as well as multisystem stress reactivity profiles, defining novel psychobiological pathways by which mitochondria may contribute to the maintenance of health and resilience, and to disease risk.",Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans,9947362,R01MH122706,"['Adrenal Glands', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catecholamines', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Control Groups', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Energy Supply', 'Esthesia', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fasting', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gatekeeping', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hematology', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'IL6 gene', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inflammatory', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial DNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Organelles', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pituitary Gland', 'Ploidies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychophysiology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Respiratory Chain', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Saliva', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trier Social Stress Test', 'allostatic load', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cognitive function', 'cytokine', 'depressive symptoms', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'executive function', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'negative affect', 'negative mood', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'resilience', 'respiratory', 'response', 'stress reactivity', 'trait', 'urinary']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,815629,-0.01732890975166889
"Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a problem of growing importance given the trend toward increased lifespan and the importance of cognitive function in determining risk for neurodegenerative disease. Despite the importance of this problem, the cognitive and molecular changes that mediate it are still poorly understood. While there are competing theories for the mediators of cognitive aging at both psychological and molecular levels, theories on aging and the research supporting them have typically focused on a single level of analysis. As our understanding of the biological basis for behavior grows, this divide becomes less sensible. Instead, psychological theory should be constrained according to its known biology, and biology should in turn inform psychological theory. Here I propose to learn neural network modeling and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques in order to bridge human psychological theory that has been the focus of my recent work to the molecular level theory that was the focus of my post-baccalaureate training at the NIA. I will build from my recent work that highlights a key statistical problem faced by the brain: how to selectively pool information across relevant sources but partition information across irrelevant ones. I will closely examine the cognitive and molecular mechanisms that allow for efficient pooling and partitioning to test the overarching theory that, due to impaired glutamate and dopamine signaling, older adults develop a selective deficit in pooling relevant sources of information. I will test this theory in two separate paradigms: visual working memory (K99) and learning and perceptual inference (R00). During the K99 phase of the award I will examine how pooling information from visual targets with similar features can 1) improve effective memory capacity, 2) be achieved by a neural network model, and 3) be impaired by simulated molecular deficiencies (glutamate, dopamine, norepinephrine). This bridge between cognitive and molecular levels of analysis will be used to test whether age-related memory deficits are due to inefficient pooling and mediated by molecular deficits in glutamate and dopamine (as measured through MRS and behavioral proxy, respectively). During the R00 phase of the award I will use the training in neural networks and MRS provided in the K99 phase to examine how 1) pooling sequential pieces of information affects learning and perceptual bias, 2) efficient pooling and partitioning can be achieved by a neural network model and 3) these processes are disrupted by specific molecular deficiencies. The established relationships between statistical properties (sequential pooling and partitioning), psychological measurements (learning and perceptual bias) and molecular factors (glutamate, dopamine, and norepinephrine signaling levels) will be used to test whether age-related differences in learning and perceptual bias reflect deficient pooling mediated by local glutamate deficiency (as measured through MRS). Overall, this work will contribute a deeper and more detailed understanding of the psychological and molecular factors that interact to mediate age-related cognitive decline. In addition, the K99 training will provide me the tools necessary to link psychological and molecular levels of analysis and the R00 phase will build the foundations of my independent research laboratory allowing me to develop a successful scientific career driven by experiments that build and refine a unified understanding of cognitive aging. Project Narrative This project will explore how changes to basic information processing in the brain occurring over the course of healthy aging may contribute to age-related deficits in learning and memory. The work will also examine the biological underpinnings of these changes and may inform future research into interventions that could slow the cognitive aging process.",Cognitive and Molecular Challenges to Statistical Inference Across Healthy Aging.,10005106,R00AG054732,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Arousal', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Comparative Study', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Dopamine', 'Elderly', 'Electroencephalography', 'Foundations', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Norepinephrine', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Psychological Theory', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral study', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'comparative', 'emerging adult', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'glutamatergic signaling', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'information processing', 'lens', 'neural network', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend', 'visual information', 'young adult']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,248038,-0.003685443714752925
"PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry Project Summary Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research, there has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. Such sharing, evaluation, and integration are necessary if computational modeling efforts are to be useful not only in generating reliable and accurate accounts of how brain subsystems operate, but also of how they interact to give rise to higher cognitive functions, and how disruptions of such interactions may give rise to disturbances of mental function observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders. This proposal seeks to meet this need by developing PsyNeuLink: an open source, Python-based software environment that makes it easy to create new models, import and/or re-implement existing ones, integrate these within a single software environment that will facilitate head-to-head comparison of comparable models, the assembly of complementary models into system-level models, and serve as a common repository for the documentation and dissemination of such models for both research and didactic purposes (i.e., publication, education, etc.). These goals will be pursued under two Specific Aims: 1) Extend the scope of modeling efforts that PsyNeuLink can accommodate by: i) enhancing its application programmer interface (API) used to add new components and interfaces to statistical analysis tools and other modeling environments (such as PyTorch, Emergent and ACT-R; ii) enriching its Library by adding PsyNeuLink implementations of influential models of neural subsystems; and iii) developing a publicly available workbook of simulation exercises as both an introduction to PsyNeuLink and for use in Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry curricula. 2) Accelerate PsyNeuLink by developing a custom compiler that preserves its simplicity and flexibility, while dramatically increasing its speed, to make it suitable for simulation of large and complex system-level models, and for parameter estimation, model fitting, and model comparison. This project will exploit the power and accelerating use of Python, and modern just-in-time compilation methods to develop a tool designed specifically for the needs of systems-level Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. This promises to open up new opportunities for research at the systems-level — a level of analysis that is crucial both for understanding how human mental function emerges from the interplay among neural subsystems, and how disturbances of individual neural subsystems impact this interplay, disruptions of which are almost certainly a critical factor in neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative Paralleling the growth of neuroscience research has been an explosion in the development of computationally explicit models of the functions of core brain subsystems. Unfortunately, however, there has not been a commensurate development of the tools needed to share, validate, and compare such models, or integrate them into models of system-level function. This proposed project seeks to address this need by developing a standard software platform for the construction, documentation, sharing, and integration of computational models of brain function, that promises to accelerate the study of how system-level interactions give rise to mental function and, critically, the kinds of disruptions of such system-level interactions produced by disturbances of individual subsystems — disruptions that are sure to be a complex but critical factor in neurological and psychiatric disorders.",PsyNeuLink:  A Block Modeling Environment for Cognitive Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry,9976610,R21MH117548,"['Acceleration', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Attention', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Environment', 'Episodic memory', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Libraries', 'Literature', 'Maintenance', 'Manuals', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Perceptual learning', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Time', 'Writing', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'flexibility', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'learning network', 'memory encoding', 'memory retrieval', 'mental function', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'open source', 'parallelization', 'preservation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'repository', 'simulation', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,197545,-0.012100427907459637
"The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative Music is a powerful memory cue that can reliably transport us to our past -- in  effect, strengthening the associative bond between our present and our past. Modern  neuroscientific investigations of episodic memory could benefit from the use of music due to its  role as a potent memory cue. In this proposal, my goal is to understand how music shapes memory   for past events and how these associations between events are represented in the brain.  The proposed work builds on recent functional MRI studies that have used naturalistic experimental  paradigms such as movie watching and recall to test and refine theories of memory  that (previously) had only been tested under highly-controlled conditions. Here we explore how film  scores shape memory for movies. In movies, film scores sometimes have recurrent structure where a  particular theme song will be repeated throughout, potentially bringing back to mind information  from previous events in which that theme song had been played. Based on prior work showing   that retrieval of a memory strengthens that memory, we predict that the presence of  recurrent musical structure in a film will trigger retrieval of previous events during  movie-watching, which (in turn) will boost memory for these events on a later recall test. In our  study, two groups of participants are recruited: The first group watches a version of a movie in  its original form (with the film score intact) and the control group watches the same film with the  entire film score removed (while preserving dialogue and ambient sounds). Participants from both  groups are asked to return the following day to recall the entire movie in chronological order. By  comparing neural activity between scenes containing music and previous scenes containing the same  (or similar) music between the two groups, we expect to find evidence of neural reinstatement of  past scenes in the music group; furthermore, we predict that higher levels of reinstatement during  movie-viewing will be associated with better subsequent recall of the movie in the music group  relative to the control group. This work will provide basic-science insight into how memory works  in real-world contexts. It will also shed light on how musical cues can strengthen memories and  improve recall; if the predicted cueing effects are observed, these techniques could be used in  future work to boost performance in memory-impaired clinical populations. The effects of music on memory in naturalistic settings are not yet well understood. In this  project, we aim to study how memory for films is affected by the presence or absence of the film  score and whether these effects can be measured neurally. This work will help develop new  neural measures of music-evoked episodic memory as well as expand our understanding of music's  effect on memory under natural conditions.",The effects of film music on neural activity in higher-order brain areas and comprehension for the film narrative,10071610,F99NS118740,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Association Learning', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Brain', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Comprehension', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Distant', 'Electroencephalography', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Music', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'markov model', 'memory recall', 'memory retrieval', 'movie', 'novel', 'portability', 'preservation', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F99,2020,46520,-0.00022661977915675938
"Neural signatures of learning complex environments in the amygdala-prefrontal network The ability to learn and think about complex situations is central to a range of human cognitive functions, including navigation, reasoning, and decision making. Numerous theories across these domains rely on representations of states of these external and internal environments, but how they acquire such representations remains unknown. My overall goal is to understand how animals, including humans, can reason and learn in such complex environments. In this project, we propose to investigate how animals are able to learn these representations in a complex sequential decision making task in monkeys. Using a novel behavioral task inspired by the board game battleship, monkeys search for hidden shapes on a screen. There are millions of possible shapes, and yet monkeys are capable learners, vastly outperforming classic reinforcement learning algorithms. How monkeys can learn the shapes so quickly remains mysterious. In addition to these unknown computational foundations for learning, the neural mechanisms that support this behavior are also unexplored. Recent studies including electrophysiology and lesion research have found signatures of state representations in the amygdala (AMYG) and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, these studies have only used very few states that only require associations to learn. Moreover, the interactions and computational roles of the regions have not been characterized. In light of these gaps in our understanding of learning in complex tasks, we will use the battleship task to elucidate 1) the aspects of the environment that drive learning representations of complex states, 2) the computational foundations of this learning using behavioral model fitting and deep neural networks, and 3) the neural mechanisms that underwrite this capacity in the AMYG-OFC circuit. We hypothesize that OFC represents hidden task states, those that cannot be fully defined in terms of perceptible stimuli and outcomes. We further hypothesize that AMYG plays a central role in learning and updating these representations by constructing an online representation of the current environment using input from OFC as well as from sensory processing and memory regions, representing current stimuli, outcomes, and associations. We posit an observer-critic architecture underlies learning representations of complex tasks, with AMYG activity computing and sending a teaching signal to OFC that learns and updates task state representations. As part of this planned research, I will be trained in advanced modeling and neural analysis techniques, and complete a course of study on the use of deep neural networks. This training will take place under the guidance of Dr. Stefano Fusi and Dr. C Daniel Salzman in the Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute at Columbia University. Despite broad relevance to understanding the mind, how people are able to learn and adapt to changes in their environments remains unknown.

"Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value A range of behavioral, physiological, and cognitive responses (e.g. approach and avoidance, autonomic reactivity, and subjective feelings) reflects a subject's emotional state. The cognitive regulation of emotion refers to the capacity to regulate these emotional responses in a flexible manner according to a cognitive operation. Deficits in the cognitive regulation of emotional processes characterize many psychiatric disorders. In everyday life, however, particular sensory stimuli and/or actions can elicit different emotional responses depending upon the situation or context. Contexts often rely on a cognitive understanding of one's current situation in the absence of explicit cues. These types of contexts may be referred to as “abstract” contexts. This grant studies a type of abstract context where the context is determined by a task set. A task set is the set of stimulus- response-outcome mappings (or rules) that dictate correct performance for trials within a particular block. Previous research demonstrates the capacity of primates to learn these abstract contexts, and neural representations of abstract contexts exist in the amygdala and two areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices (ACC and OFC). This grant seeks to understand the mechanisms that underlie the formation and maintenance of these representations of contexts. In contrast to supervised learning driven by error signals, we hypothesize that the occurrence of temporally associated trial types triggers unsupervised learning, presumably through a Hebbian mechanism involving activity-dependent plasticity. This learning could underlie formation of representations of abstract contexts defined by task sets, which will be explored with electrophysiological recordings in Aim 1. The creation of a representation of a task set requires combining information about the current trial with information about the trials that have occurred recently. Brain structures that provide memory traces of recent events and/or that combine information over time could create representations of a task set prior to the emergence of the representations observed in amygdala, OFC, and ACC. Our next experiments therefore target the hippocampus and dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC), which are implicated in memory processes, working memory, and executive functions. We will compare and contrast the encoding of task sets in hippocampus, DLPFC, OFC, and ACC during and after learning about task sets (Aim 2). Finally, we will use causal methods to determine if PFC input to the amygdala and the hippocampus acts to maintain these context representations, which could be a vital mechanism for the cognitive regulation of emotion (Aim 3). Overall, these experiments promise to illuminate neurophysiological mechanisms critical for normal adaptive emotional health. ! The aim of this proposal is to understand brain mechanisms responsible for the cognitive regulation of emotion. Since many psychiatric disorders, like anxiety and mood disorders as well as schizophrenia, autism, and addiction, involve cognitive dysfunction mediated by neural circuits in the brain areas under study, this project promises to provide new insights about neural network function critical for developing new treatments.",Neurophysiology underlying neural representations of value,9819777,R01MH082017,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Cues', 'Development', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Feeling', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Mood Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'executive function', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'memory process', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurophysiology', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,698101,0.015338966022297961
"Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The brain is able to form learned associations between stimuli and the rewards or punishments they predict, which then guide appropriate behavioral responses to maximize survival. However, responses to environmental stimuli are severely altered in neurological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. Understanding the neural circuits which mediate learned associations and motivated behavior is therefore of crucial importance both from a basic science and human health perspective. The amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) has circuit connectivity which suggests a role in these processes, but the function of this region is almost completely unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the ASt acts as a parallel circuit to the amygdala to mediate associative learning and behavioral responses. In the mentored phase (K99) experiments, a combination of optogenetics, in vivo electrophysiology and advanced computational analysis will be used to identify subpopulations of neurons in the ASt that encode stimulus information and specific behaviors. The independent phase (R00) experiments will determine the contribution of inputs from the thalamus, cortex and lateral amygdala to ASt activity encoding cue information, and determine whether synapses from these projections onto ASt neurons are strengthened in associative learning. Preliminary data for this study show that 1) genetically distinct populations of ASt neurons have opposing responses to cues predicting rewards or punishments, and 2) optogenetic inhibition of one of these populations results in a striking reduction in conditioned fear responses. This suggests that the ASt may indeed play a critical role in behavioral responses traditionally attributed to the amygdala. A successful outcome of this proposal could therefore result in a major conceptual revision of current models of the circuit mechanisms underlying associative learning. The study will also provide new insight into the long-standing open question of how significant behavioral responses to conditioned stimuli still persist even following bilateral loss-of-function manipulations targeting the amygdala. This will not only increase our fundamental knowledge of the circuits underlying motivated behavior, but could also identify ASt circuits as vital new targets of interest for neurological disorders where normal behavioral responses to stimuli are disrupted. All proposed research will be conducted Dr. Fergil Mills in the lab of Dr. Kay Tye at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which is fully equipped for the proposed experiments. The proposal also includes a comprehensive training plan to facilitate Dr. Mills's career development, and will prepare him to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator studying neural circuit mechanisms underlying normal and pathological behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Normal responses to environmental stimuli are disrupted in many neuropsychiatric disorders, leading to damaging behavioral outcomes. This study will determine the role of the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) - an almost completely unstudied structure - in mediating learned behavioral responses to stimuli that predict rewards or punishments. The proposed research project will increase our knowledge of the fundamental neural mechanisms underlying associative learning and motivated behaviors, and could identify ASt circuits as novel targets of interest for psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.",Determining the role of amygdalostriatal transition zone circuits in associative learning and motivated behaviors,10015338,K99MH121563,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event', 'Health', 'Human', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor output', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Punishment', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'career development', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'loss of function', 'motivated behavior', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'response']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2020,126090,-0.013901739110202998

The basal ganglia (BG) and in particular the input nucleus of the BG, the striatum, is critical for the proper sequencing and selection of actions. At a cellular level, the striatum is comprised of spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that constitute the direct pathway (dSPNs) and indirect pathway (iSPNs). Under the center-surround model of action selection, dSPNs are thought to facilitate the expression of an action while iSPNs are thought to inhibit the expression of other actions. However, it is not clear how each pathway contributes to action selection due to methodological constraints in acquiring an objectively quantitative description of behavior. Our lab has recently developed a pipeline, known as MoSeq, that acquires high-resolution behavioral data and uses an unsupervised algorithm to model stereotyped pose dynamics (actions or “syllables”). Here I propose to combine this state-of- the-art behavioral acquisition and detection technology with both cellular-resolution imaging and optogenetic perturbation to study the population dynamics underlying action selection in the striatum. I hypothesize that SPNs exhibit syllable-specific tuning, where dSPNs are tightly tuned to facilitate the expression of related syllables, while iSPNs are more broadly tuned to suppress the simultaneous expression of other syllables. I will dissect these two processes by recording and manipulating each SPN class during specific syllable expression. In aim 1, I will perform cellular-resolution recordings of the direct or indirect pathway using genetically encoded calcium indicators and miniaturized microendoscopy in the striatum. I will examine the differential roles of the direct and indirect pathways in the context of behavioral tuning. My preliminary data suggest that dSPNs are more sparsely tuned than iSPNs. In aim 2, I will functionally test the center-surround model via direct and indirect pathway inhibition. I will use the inhibitory anion-conducting rhodopsin, ACR2. Using a system capable of detecting syllable expression in real-time, I will perturb each pathway triggered upon the expression of specific syllables to compare the same selection context across many trials. In summary, the experiments proposed here will contribute to a mechanistic understanding of how the BG performs action selection on a moment-to-moment timescale. This proposal is the first to test the predictions made by the center- surround model and will advance our understanding of how the BG encodes actions. Behavior is constructed from actions that are placed into sequences that enable animals to achieve ethologically relevant goals. The striatum, the input nucleus of the basal ganglia, is critical for the proper selection and expression of actions.

"Guiding next steps for SPRINT-MIND implementation: Identifying high-benefit subgroups and comparative effects of ARB- vs. ACEI-based regimens PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the leading cause of dependence and disability in the elderly population worldwide, costing the US healthcare system over $200 billion annually. Because ADRD represents a continuous irreversible physical and cognitive decline, identifying effective approaches for its prevention is imperative. Hypertension, particularly in midlife, is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline and ADRD. Recent data from the randomized Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) Intervention Trial (SPRINT) Memory and cognition IN Decreased hypertension (SPRINT MIND) demonstrated that intensive SBP control (<120 mmHg) reduced the combined incidence of adjudicated mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable dementia, as well as abnormal white matter lesion (WML) volume compared to standard BP control (<140 mmHg) over five years follow up. To maximize public health impact, it is critical to identify which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and if cognitive benefits were due to direct effects of specific antihypertensive medications on cognition independent of, or in addition to, their BP-lowering effect. Prior animal and human studies, as well as our preliminary data, suggest that angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) have greater effects on cognition than angiotensin-converting- enzyme inhibitors (ACEI). If verified, this finding would be significant since ARBs and ACEIs are currently among the medications most commonly prescribed to older adults and are thought to be equivalent in benefit and safety. Our objective is to answer remaining questions of how to safely implement SPRINT in older patients most likely to derive cognitive benefits from intensive SBP treatment. With its large sample size, 5 years follow-up, and high-quality repeated measures of rigorously adjudicated cognitive outcomes, brain imaging, and antihypertensive medication use, SPRINT MIND provides a unique, cost-efficient, and ideal setting to answer these questions. We aim to: (1) develop and validate a prediction tool that quantifies patients’ expected cognitive benefits and net (overall) benefit incorporating cognitive and cardiovascular benefit and risk of SAEs under intensive SBP treatment, and (2) determine comparative effects, including dose-response, of ARB- vs. ACEI-based antihypertensive medication regimens on cognitive and brain structure outcomes independent of SBP-lowering effects. Though SPRINT MIND is among the first randomized trials to demonstrate a beneficial preventive effect on cognition, it is uncertain how SPRINT-MIND should be implemented and in which patients. Successful completion of this project will guide next steps for implementation by determining: (1) which patients derive the greatest cognitive and net (overall) benefit from intensive SBP treatment and (2) if ARBs have greater beneficial effects on cognitive outcomes and WML volume than ACEIs, independent of their similar SBP lowering effects.

"The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning - Project Summary. This project explores how humans learn at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this supports human intelligence. Human decisions are typically hierarchically structured: we make high-level decisions (making a cup of coffee), which constrain lower level decisions (grinding coffee beans, boiling water, etc.), which themselves constrain simpler and simpler decisions and motor actions. This hierarchy in decisions is paralleled by a hierarchy in our representation of our environment: some sensory signals trigger simple decisions (a red light signals a stop), while other signal a broader, more abstract behavioral change (rain signals a set of adaptations when driving). Thus, complex hierarchical structure underlies the way we respond to our environment in seemingly simple, everyday tasks. This ability is supported by the prefrontal cortex, which represents states and decisions at multiple degrees of hierarchical abstraction. My previous work shows that hierarchical representations support transfer and generalization while learning, an ability that artificial agents still struggle to match human performance in. However, how we learn to form these hierarchical representations is poorly understood, despite how crucial it is for human intelligence. The proposed work will examine how multiple, parallel hierarchical loops between prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia support reinforcement learning at multiple hierarchical levels in parallel, and how this promotes flexible behavior. To this end, we will address three aims: 1. We will show that the same reinforcement learning computations happen in parallel at multiple levels of abstraction, as hypothesized by our computational model of prefrontal- subcortical networks. 2. We will demonstrate that humans partition learning problems into multiple sequential subgoals so they can learn multiple simple strategies instead of one complex strategy, and that reusing these simple strategies promotes fast exploration and learning. 3. We will show that hierarchical learning does not rely exclusively on rewards, but that novelty signals are crucial for identifying subgoals and learning through curiosity. Across all three aims, we will use behavioral experiments in conjunction with computational modeling to characterize how humans learn hierarchically. In addition, we will use EEG and fMRI to identify the neural computations underlying the cognitive systems inferred from behavior and modeling. This project will provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to learning, and thus provide a better handle on the sources of learning dysfunction observed in many psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, ADHD, and OCD. Additionally, it will provide new tools, in the form of experimental protocols and precise computational models, for studying learning across populations and species. Project Narrative This proposal will explore how learning hierarchically structured representations of our environments helps humans adapt flexibly and efficiently to new situations. We will record how people learn to make simple decisions, observe changes in brain activity, and use mathematical models to study how hierarchical learning happens in the brain. This will help explain how human learning can be so efficient and flexible, how mental conditions such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety cause learning and decision-making impairments, and will help develop better treatments.",The neural computations supporting hierarchical reinforcement learning,9894854,R01MH119383,"['Address', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Curiosities', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Rain', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Variant', 'Water', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'bean', 'cognitive system', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2020,381213,-0.007545949206246122
"CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit Dopamine (DA) neurons are fundamental to many aspects of behavior, and dysfunction of the DA system contributes to a wide range of disorders, including drug addiction. How does DA contribute to such a diversity of functions and dysfunctions? Part of the answer may relate to recent discoveries that DA neurons respond to a wide range of behavioral variables - not only to reward and reward-predicting cues, as traditionally examined, but also to other variables including position, movement, and behavioral choices. However, to date, the relative contributions of these behavioral variables to DA responses have not been examined quantitatively, in part because cellular resolution DA recordings have not been performed in behavioral settings with sufficient complexity and quantification to examine these diverse variables simultaneously. To address this gap, we propose to perform two-photon imaging from ensembles of midbrain DA neurons and their target neurons as mice learn to perform a complex decision-making task. However, characterizing the relationship between neural activity and behavior in this complex dataset presents a number of statistical challenges. These include the autocorrelation of the calcium indicator, the correlation between behavioral variables, the possibility of changes in the relationship between neural activity and behavior over time, and the need to leverage the availability of simultaneously measured neurons in order to improve statistical efficiency. Thus, we propose a suite of new statistical tools to address all of these challenges. These tools will be broadly applicable to the analysis of datasets throughout the addiction circuits (and the nervous system more broadly). Dopamine neurons are implicated in a wide range of normal behavioral functions, as well as a wide range of neuropsychiatric diseases, including addiction. The identification of sub-populations of dopamine neurons with different functional properties could provide much-needed insight into how dopamine neurons contribute to the neurobiology of addiction.",CRCNS: Theory and Experiments to Elucidate Neural Coding in the Reward Circuit,9983641,R01DA047869,"['Address', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Normal Range', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pythons', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'addiction', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'neural correlate', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'software development', 'theories', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user-friendly', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,279706,-0.00463383596618892
"The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay Project Summary The hippocampus is a critical site for rapid memory formation and retrieval, with extensively documented functions representing spatial and navigational variables, yet less is known of the means by which it guides behavior. Bursts of hippocampal activity identified in many species as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events are promising neural mechanisms to link hippocampal activity and behavioral function, since during SWRs hippocampus can represent positions the animal previously experienced, or will traverse in the near future. This proposal considers the food-caching behaviors of chickadees, who use a hippocampal-dependent, one- shot memory to guide cache retrieval. This behavior is exceptionally promising to link hippocampal activity to individual experiences, which has been a barrier to determining the nature of representations during SWR and their function in previous studies. These studies will develop a comprehensive account of how chickadee behavior is affected by cache site memory, determine whether SWRs are related to memory-specific components of caching behavior, and determine whether SWRs represent individual cache sites to assist later retrieval. I hypothesize that memory-guided behavior is distinguishable from random foraging. I will use video tracking to measure the behavioral microstructure of chickadee caching behavior, including postural and gaze time series, and develop quantitative models of behavioral motifs and their temporal structure. Using these tools to compare memory-guided and random foraging behaviors, I will develop decoders that indicate precisely how and when behavior appears memory-guided. I hypothesize that SWRs occur more often, and are more predictive of behavior, when behavior is memory- guided. I will use electrophysiology in freely moving chickadees during caching to relate SWRs to the microstructural analysis of behavior and decoding of behavioral strategy. I hypothesize that SWRs reactivate representations of previous, individual caching events, and that this reactivation improves subsequent retrieval for that individual site. Using electrophysiological recordings in caching birds, I will relate reactivations to the accuracy of retrieval behavior. Using online SWR detection and suppression, I will further determine if SWRs causally affect later retrieval behavior. Project Narrative Food caching birds are a unique model system for dissecting the fundamental principles of hippocampal function. Thorough characterization and computational modeling of this behavior, and the specific contribution of hippocampal memory, will allow insight into the neural mechanisms by which hippocampal representations guide behavior. We expect the principles resulting from this study to illuminate dysfunctions of memory present in many neurological disorders.",The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay,9991327,F32MH123015,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Future', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Series', 'Site', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'way finding']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2020,73106,0.02494761561813345
"Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization Project Summary: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization A recent White House initiative titled Advancing American Kidney Health outlines the current administration's plans to increase the supply of kidneys in the US, along with other measures that attempt to correct the imbalance between supply and demand for kidneys. In alignment with this White House initiative, the principal investigator (PI) of this project will develop algorithms to assist Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) make donor disposition decisions with the goal of increasing the supply of transplantable organs. The PI will harness the vast amount of data collected by OPOs, and customize as well as develop new Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify good donors. These algorithms will reduce case coordinators workload and improve the accuracy of their decisions. The PI's objective is to quantity the impact of AI-assisted decision-making on increasing the supply of kidneys by ﬁnding missed opportunities on account of the current manual processes. Even a few more potential donors per OPO will help reduce the organ shortage problem when scaled to all 58 OPOs across the country.  This project will leverage unique data sets to generate and test hypotheses concerning which fac- tors aﬀect donor disposition decisions, and which information processing protocols produce greater referral-to-donor conversion rate. It will also customize classiﬁcation algorithms to assist case co- ordinators make donor disposition decisions. The focus will be on improving both the accuracy and speed of such decisions. As a follow up of this project, the PI will conduct a broader study involving at least ﬁve additional OPOs. The ﬁve OPOs will be selected to represent the diversity in size, population, and geography among the 58 OPOs across the country. Results of this and the follow-up study will be shared freely with all OPOs. The proposed research has the potential to increase the number of donors, free up staﬀ time, and lower OPO labor costs.  The potential impact of this project lies in the formulation and testing of hypotheses that can beneﬁt OPO decision-making and people on transplant wait list, customization of existing machine learning algorithms and computational techniques for sequential decision-making in a novel setting, and laying the groundwork for the development of new methods in the future.  The PI has the necessary disciplinary expertise, and management and leadership experience to succeed in the proposed eﬀorts. He has access to advanced computing resources and administrative help from the University of Texas. Finally, he has obtained the necessary IRB approval to proceed with this project. 1 Project Narrative: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization The widespread use of electronic medical record systems by hospitals, and electronic capture of referrals data by the organ procurement organizations (OPOs) makes it possible to harness large amounts of data to augment human decision-making and ask whether this can increase the supply of organs, speciﬁcally kidneys. The PI in this project will focus on improving the speed and accuracy of case coordinators' donor-disposition decisions by developing and testing customized machine learning and sequential decision-making algorithms using data from two OPOs. These eﬀorts will help quantify the potential beneﬁt of leveraging OPO data to increase kidney supply and pave the way for a larger study focusing on multiple OPOs.",Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization,10042096,R03HS027671,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,41981,-0.027646475492318853
"Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness Project Summary    The focus of this proposal is a 3-­year training plan that will allow me to build on my prior research on the  cognitive neuroscience of empathy and altruism to take a neuroeconomic approach to understanding  excessively selfish social preferences. Supervised by experts in neuroeconomics (Dr. Kable) and transcranial  magnetic stimulation (TMS) (Dr. Oathes), I will examine how deficits in affective and cognitive empathy may  independently contribute to selfish behavior, at both the behavioral and neural levels. Clinical disorders  including psychopathy and narcissism are characterized by empathic deficits and pathological selfishness, in  which social choices are abnormally self-­interested. Further, affective and cognitive empathy have been found  to be dissociable behaviorally and neurally. The proposed research will build on these findings in several  important ways. First, behavioral modeling approaches common in neuroeconomics will be used to quantify  selfish social preferences and examine how both decreased generosity and decreased advantageous inequity  aversion are associated with empathic deficits. Second, advanced cognitive neuroscience methods will be  used to examine how affective and cognitive empathy networks independently contribute to selfishness. This  will be accomplished through both individual-­level cross-­task decoding via multivoxel pattern analysis and the  use of TMS to disrupt neural activation to causally implicate neural regions in selfish behavior. Across three  research aims, a modified dictator game (DG) will be utilized to quantify both generosity and inequity aversion.  The first aim is to characterize excessive selfishness behaviorally through the use of economic paradigms and  trait self-­report questionnaires. It is expected that highly selfish individuals will have lower trait empathy and  higher levels of psychopathic and narcissistic traits. The second aim is to characterize excessive selfishness  neurally through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging during social preference choices and  empathic processing. It is hypothesized that individual variation in selfish behavior in the DG will be  independently predicted by decreased expression of brain-­wide multivariate patterns associated with affective  and cognitive empathy, centered on anterior insula (AI) and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). The third aim is to  examine the causal roles of the AI and TPJ in social preferences through the use of brain stimulation. Through  the use of TMS, we can disrupt neural processing in these regions, thus allowing for causal inference about the  roles of these regions in selfishness. It is expected that disrupting neural activation in the TPJ will cause an  increase in selfish behavior in the DG via the disruption of cognitive empathy, while indirect disruption of the AI  will cause an increase in selfish behavior via disruption of affective empathy. Better computational  understanding of how affective and cognitive empathic deficits independently contribute to excessively selfish  tendencies, and how these deficits map to psychopathic and narcissistic traits, could inform individualized  clinical interventions utilizing excitatory brain stimulation to enhance the implicated empathic neural networks.  Project Narrative    While cooperation is a norm of human behavior, some individuals are excessively selfish, engaging in harmful  antisocial behavior with profound public health consequences. How deficits in affective and cognitive empathy  independently contribute to selfishness at the behavioral and neural levels is not well quantified. This research  will combine behavioral modeling and advanced cognitive neuroscience methods to computationally  characterize the processes that lead to pathological selfishness like that seen in psychopathy and narcissism. ",Neural mechanisms of pathological selfishness,9989900,F32MH115661,"['Address',

"The role of memory reactivation in emotional memory suppression and regulation Project Summary  Over the course of our lifetimes, we are bound to experience distressing, negative events we would rather not remember over and over again. Importantly, there is variability in people’s ability to cope with these memories. How do people regulate negative emotional memories, and why are some people better at dealing with negative memories than others? For my dissertation, I will investigate these questions through the lens of cognitive neuroscience, specifically looking at how memory reactivation strength can predict one’s ability to deal with negative memories. Prior work from the Norman Lab has postulated a U-shaped relationship between memory reactivation strength and the fate of a memory: Moderate reactivation leads to memory weakening while strong reactivation leads to strengthening. This proposal examines the impact of memory reactivation strength in 3 studies: In Study 1, I focus on memory suppression, a coping strategy where people try to stop an unwanted memory from coming to mind after it has been triggered by a cue in the environment. I will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to relate the neural measure of memory reactivation during a memory suppression task to subsequent memory reactivation. In this study, for which data collection should be completed by the start of the F99 Phase, I will also examine the impact of inter-subject differences in depression level; prior research has shown that depressed participants appear to demonstrate a negative bias, which might be relevant to how strongly memories are reactivated. In Study 2, I will shift my focus to study cognitive reappraisal, an alternative strategy whereby participants reframe the interpretation of a negative event to mitigate the emotional intensity tied to its memory. Although this strategy requires bringing a memory to mind so that it can be reinterpreted, the impact of memory reactivation on cognitive reappraisal has not been well studied. I will use fMRI to investigate this gap in the literature, using data from a study for which data collection is already underway in the Ritchey Lab. Finally, in Study 3, I will use the eye tracker to study whether the application of temporally targeted visual stimuli can be used to modify subsequent memory performance by modulating memory reactivation strength. Prior research has demonstrated the relevance of using eye-tracking, which has finer temporal resolution and is more accessible than fMRI, to examine memory reactivation. Put together, this work will provide more insight into how memory reactivation strength influences the fate of negative memories, specifically after engaging in memory suppression and cognitive reappraisal. It will also elucidate ways in which memory reactivation can be leveraged and optimized in different coping strategies for dealing with unwanted, negative memories. The expertise of my sponsor, co- sponsor, and collaborator will be pivotal to my development as a researcher and the success of my dissertation work. In the K00 Phase, I will expand my knowledge of mental health disorders so that I can be equipped to become an independent researcher at the intersection of cognitive neuroscience and mental health disorders. Project Narrative  For my dissertation, I will investigate inter-subject and inter-trial differences in memory reactivation strength and how this variability affects memory suppression and cognitive reappraisal efficacy. This work will help to identify ways in which memory reactivation can be optimally leveraged to help people cope with negative, unwanted memories.

"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,9911141,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,37429,-0.06700306602046165
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9989897,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,204080,0.03710362047613451
"Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence Project Summary/Abstract The long-term goal of our investigations is to understand how neural circuits in the frontal cortex support decision- making. Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in decision-making under uncertainty and is thought to enable humans and other animals to make predictions about outcomes more accurately. The objective of this proposal is to determine the algorithms responsible for confidence-guided behaviors and their neural basis in the mammalian brain.  Previous work from our laboratory has shown that `decision confidence', a cognitive variable, is encoded in single OFC neurons and OFC inactivation specifically impairs a confidence-guided behavior, time investment. The proposed experiments are designed to determine the computational and neural algorithms responsible for two confidence-guided behaviors: time investment and choice strategy updating (learning). Our central hypothesis is that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence, independent of sensory evidence, that supports multiple confidence-guided behaviors. To test this idea, we have designed a quantitative psychophysical task for rats, adapted from human and primate work, that enable behavioral readouts of confidence, as a post-decision temporal wager. Simply, after each perceptual decision (olfactory or auditory) rats invest time waiting for a delayed, uncertain reward. These graded- duration time investments serve as a behavioral report of confidence that the perceptual decision just made will result in the success of the perceptual decision. First, we will develop computational algorithms to explain confidence-guided time investment and learning, and second we will identify neural substrates of these algorithms in the OFC. Third, we will determine if OFC representations are sensory-modality and behavioral-output general and test the causal role of OFC using inactivations. Finally, we will map a sensory route for auditory information to inform OFC representations and test the hypothesis that auditory cortex lesions lead to deaf-hearing, the ability to discriminate sounds without perceptual confidence.  These contributions are significant, in our opinion, because they will provide critical missing information about the algorithmic and neural foundations of decision confidence, a key cognitive variable. Our approach is innovative, chiefly because we have developed a computational and behavioral framework to study confidence in rats. Beyond these mechanistic studies, the proposed work will advance knowledge about the frontal cortical logic of cognitive variable representations and inform an improved framework for understanding how impairments in a single brain area can lead to a wide range of psychiatric disorders, as seen in depression, obsessive- compulsive and psychotic disorders. Project narrative This proposal aims to identify the computational algorithms of two confidence-guided behaviors, time investment and choice strategy updating, and the neural processes underlying these. We will use a combination of electrophysiology, viral tracing, optogenetics in a quantitative confidence-reporting behavior in rats, interpreted with computational modeling and statistical analysis. We aim to test our central hypothesis that OFC generates an abstract representation of decision confidence that supports multiple confidence-guided behavioral processes.",Behavioral and neural algorithms for decision confidence,10058676,R01MH097061,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Auditory area', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral trial', 'Belief', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Logic', 'Maps', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Neurons', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Psychophysics', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sensory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Viral', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Wages', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'deaf', 'design', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'frontal lobe', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory cortex', 'sound', 'success']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,500079,-0.007952212847278964
"Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this project is to understand the circuit mechanisms underlying neuronal sequence coordination across hippocampus and neocortex and their role in learning and memory. Cells that participated in a recent experience are reactivated in the form of ordered sequences that recapitulate behavior in a temporally compressed manner. These reactivations are coordinated by synchronous network events known as sharp-wave ripples (SWRs) that originate in the hippocampus and propagate to the neocortex. It has been proposed that SWRs and associated neuronal sequences mediate memory consolidation, planning and learning but a direct proof of these functions is still lacking. Additionally, several brain disorders characterized by learning and memory deficits have been related to disrupted SWRs. To guide behavior and decision making, the neocortex is believed to generalize across individual experiences encoded in the hippocampus to infer environmental regularities and rules. SWRs entrain neocortical activity, but how downstream cortical areas read out the hippocampal code transmitted during SWRs and use this information to guide goal-oriented behavior is unknown.  I will perform silicon probe recordings and optogenetic manipulations in the hippocampus and its main cortical target regions of behaving rats and mice to test the functional role and circuit mechanisms of SWR sequences during the different phases of goal-oriented behavior. First, I will use a novel optogenetic approach for closed-loop manipulation of SWRs to directly test whether SWRs associated sequences support memory-guided behavior. My preliminary data supports the hypothesis that SWRs became longer with increased memory demands thus allowing extended replay events, and that those prolonged sequences are necessary and sufficient for memory-guided navigation and spatial learning. Second, I will examine the impact of SWRs on downstream cortical targets, in the context of goal-oriented spatial behavior. I will test if there is a specific functional topography of hippocampo-cortical interactions, with dorsal and ventral hippocampal SWRs propagating preferentially to retrosplenial and prefrontal cortices. I hypothesized that hippocampo –cortical synchrony during SWRs will gradually increase with learning and that this process could lead to the generation of abstract representations, or schemas, in the cortex that will facilitate future decisions. Finally, I will test whether SWR-associated cortical sequences are locally generated or inherited from the hippocampus and how different classes of interneurons contribute to them. To achieve this, I will record and optogenetically manipulate different cell sub-types in transgenic mice.  By using an innovative experimental approach, the proposed project will provide novel insights into the circuit mechanisms and behavioral role of neuronal sequences involved in learning and memory. This knowledge will also shed light into the mechanisms underlying memory deficits in neural disorders such as Alzheimer disease, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. It may also open new avenues for more targeted, closed-loop interventions in these disorders.  The scientific skills developed during the training period of this project will be crucial for the accomplishment of the immediate scientific goals and become the pillars for the research I will develop in my future independent laboratory. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to understand how distributed brain circuits generate neuronal dynamics that support learning and memory. It will directly test if the sequential reactivation of cell assemblies that recapitulate experience is necessary for memory-guided behavior and elucidate how these sequences are coordinated on a global scale. These experiments will not only be important for understanding the physiological mechanisms of learning and memory in healthy brains but also how neuronal disorders such as Alzheimer or schizophrenia lead to their impairment.",Hippocampo-cortical circuit mechanisms of neuronal sequences during learning,9994009,K99MH120343,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Spatial Behavior', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Viral', 'cell assembly', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'goal oriented behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory consolidation', 'neocortical', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K99,2020,129087,0.010979333247917736
"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",9891099,R01MH119421,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endoscopes', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Opsin', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Virus', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'data analysis pipeline', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fear memory', 'graph theory', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'neuronal excitability', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2020,355558,-0.005248664274726447
"Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention The understanding of the brain mechanisms of emotion and motivation has grown steadily in the past two decades. The majority of the work in the rodent and human literatures has relied heavily on particular paradigms, such as the perception of faces with emotion content in humans, and aversive conditioning procedures in both humans and animals. The present application proposes a series of experimental paradigms that are ecologically inspired, semi- naturalistic, and dynamic.  The objective of this application is to investigate the dynamics of threat processing during escape behaviors, as well as the dynamics of threat/reward processing during approach- avoid conflict paradigms. Across experiments, we seek to both characterize and test specific hypotheses centered around a set of brain regions implicated in aversive and appetitive processing. We seek to characterize their contributions individually but also as distributed circuits that collectively and dynamically support behaviors.  The proposed work is organized around two aims. Aim 1 investigates the circuits supporting threat escape. Rodent studies suggest that the ventral striatum/accumbens is an important node during escape behaviors. Whereas some work in humans (e.g., avoidance conditioning) supports this notion, other work with ethologically inspired paradigms has also revealed the participation of regions such as the mid-cingulate cortex and the anterior hippocampus. Experiments will test the contributions of these and other brain regions to escape mechanisms. Aim 2 investigates the circuits involved in aversive and appetitive interactions during dynamic threat and reward processing. Experiments will employ dynamic stimuli where the proximity to threat and reward vary dynamically.  Collectively, the work addresses a set of basic research questions aimed at understanding how emotion/motivation circuits outlined in the past decades supports dynamic processing. The potential results may inform the clinically-oriented human literature, which has been heavily informed and inspired by research with standard experimental paradigms. This project aims to study emotion and motivation in the human brain of typical participants with functional magnetic resonance imaging. We will study mechanisms of escaping from threat and approaching reward and how they interact. The project attempts to contribute to the understanding to processes that support many human behaviors, and may inform potential treatments of conditions such as anxiety disorders and substance abuse.",Interaction of Emotional Perception and Visual Attention,10058351,R01MH071589,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Coin', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Neurons', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Series', 'Stimulus', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Vision', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'aversive conditioning', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'face perception', 'gang', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'reward processing', 'stem', 'virtual']",NIMH,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,719764,-0.04900163232289326
"The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning As animals move about in the environment, they must be able to rapidly assess and update the meaning of cues around them in order to approach reward and avoid danger. Reversal learning, a paradigm commonly used to test behavioral flexibility, involves switching the association between a stimulus and its outcome. For example, a tone that initially predicted a sweet tastant can come to predict a bitter tastant. Two brain regions, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA), are involved in tasks that demand flexible responses to the changing significance of stimuli during reversal learning. While several studies have provided evidence that the OFC and BLA interact during reversal learning, little is known about the specific mechanisms of this interaction. In this grant, we propose to use a combination of genetic and cellular imaging techniques in mice to identify and characterize the physiological response properties during reversal learning of BLA neurons that project to OFC. The reversal learning task we employ involves stimuli of multiple modalities that predict outcomes of both positive and negative value to thoroughly elucidate the differential response properties of BLA neurons to stimuli that change their associated reinforcement outcome (Aim 1). In these experiments, the physiological response properties of neurons identified as projecting from BLA to OFC will be compared to the response properties of the overall population. Then, using an optogenetic approach, we will test the causal role of OFC input onto BLA neurons during reversal learning by inhibiting the specific projections from OFC to BLA to test their causal role on behavioral flexibility and on the nature of representations in BLA (Aim 2). The data analysis for both aims involves collaboration with theoretical neuroscientists to use linear classifiers and other sophisticated techniques to understand the nature and dynamics of neural encoding in BLA and its relation to behavior. These experiments promise to shed light on the mechanisms by which cortico-amygdalar circuits mediate flexibility critical for adaptive emotional responses and behavior, an ability that is impaired in individuals with psychiatric disorders. This grant investigates the dynamic interactions between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala during a reversal learning task involving both rewarding and aversive outcomes. The study promises to elucidate mechanisms fundamental to the flexible updating of emotional behavior, mechanisms that likely become dysfunctional in psychiatric disorders.",The interactive roles of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during reversal learning,9842566,R21MH116348,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quinine', 'Research', 'Reversal Learning', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Update', 'Virus', 'anatomic imaging', 'behavior test', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'emotional behavior', 'expectation', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'fluorophore', 'genetic approach', 'insight', 'lens', 'neurotoxic', 'optogenetics', 'outcome prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virus genetics']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2020,202500,0.007547529635297793
"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity.

This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning.

"Socioemotional Processing and Aggression Project Summary/Abstract Complex relationships exist between mental illness and aggression, particularly interpersonal aggression that can lead to antisocial behavior. Unfortunately, conducting high-impact mental health research among those who have committed serious aggressive acts against persons has been strategically challenging for many reasons. This research plan employs unique resources that enable advanced cognitive neuroscience research to be conducted in forensic environments. Here we leverage these resources to examine impaired functioning of neural circuits that contribute to specific varieties of serious aggressive behavior. Callous and unemotional traits, impulsive/disinhibited behavior, and appetitive desire to harm others, all have identifiable roots in neurocognitive function. We will examine how clinical levels of these latter traits are related to abnormalities in the neural circuits involved in affective perspective taking, moral decision-making, and behavioral inhibition. Normative neural responses for each of these processes have been well-characterized by our prior work. We seek to differentiate between unique pathophysiological etiologies that contribute to specific behavioral tendencies. We further aim to elucidate the modifying influence of early childhood trauma in these neurocognitive domains. Understanding these differences will promote more sophisticated prevention and intervention strategies that incorporate specific knowledge of neurocognitive vulnerabilities and remedial approaches for improving long-range outcomes for individuals and for the public. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Aggressive behavior is a major public health concern that intersects with challenging venues of mental health research. This research plan implements unique resources to carry out cognitive neuroscience research among highly aggressive inmates with mental illnesses to differentiate among several etiological trajectories promoting these behaviors. The outcomes of this work will foster more sophisticated strategies for recognizing the potential for aggression and implementing more effective interventions, with the ultimate goal of preventing aggression and victimization in society.",Socioemotional Processing and Aggression,9831645,R01MH114028,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Desire for food', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Modeling', 'Morals', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Paraphilias', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Plant Roots', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Secure', 'Self Perception', 'Social Processes', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'aggression prevention', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'base', 'callous unemotional trait', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'data structure', 'early childhood', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'mental state', 'morphometry', 'multimodal data', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'offender', 'pediatric trauma', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'symptomatology', 'trait', 'trait impulsivity', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2020,698835,0.014764128011899039
"Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control This project focuses on understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms that give rise to cognitive control. Cognitive control processes are a component of human mental function that is fundamentally important in a wide range of domains, including attention, working memory, episodic memory, and decision making. Cognitive control disruptions are thought to be a major source of functional impairment for individuals suffering from a variety of mental health disorders and neuropsychiatric diseases, which is why they feature prominently in the NIMH RDoC matrix. Over the last decade, we have developed a theoretically coherent and mechanistic model, the Dual Mechanisms of Control (DMC) framework, which has the following core tenets: 1) cognitive control can operate in distinct modes, proactive and reactive; 2) these modes are associated with unique dynamic neural signatures, involving a shift between sustained and transient engagement of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and its interactions with the cingulo-opercular network (CON) and fronto-striatal circuitry; 3) they represent a core dimension of variability, present across a range of cognitive domains (i.e., indicating a psychologically coherent construct); 4) this variability is both state-related (and thus affected by task/situation and endogenous factors) and trait-related (a key component of individual variation); and 5) the variation encompasses cognitive control function in healthy young adults, but also in more extreme forms, contributes to dysfunction present in various impaired populations (e.g., schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, aging). Under a current MERIT award, we have been directly testing these core tenets of the DMC framework, through a large-scale project, which samples monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and participants from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and to comprehensively characterize proactive and reactive control at the behavioral, neural, and genetic levels. The current proposal takes full advantage of the extensive infrastructure we have already developed for this project to dramatically expand its scope, explanatory depth, and utility to the scientific community. Specifically, we propose a rigorous, multi-pronged study, that integrates our optimized cognitive control task battery with mindfulness skills training (MT), a longitudinal design with repeated neuroimaging assessments, comprehensive “neuro-psychometric” characterization of individual variation utilizing state-of-the-art analytic techniques, and incorporation of current best practices (i.e., following Open Science Framework [OSF] recommendations), to maximize the transparency, reproducibility, and ease of dissemination of project tools and findings. Success is in this effort will have important theoretical and clinical implications, by providing a clearer understanding of the sources of normal human variation, and even more importantly, highlighting potential risk vulnerability factors for a range of mental health disorders. This project will provide detailed information regarding the brain-basis of normal human variation in higher mental functions such as attention, memory and decision-making, and how such functions are impacted by positive lifestyle interventions (i.e., mindfulness training). This information has high relevance for public health by furthering our understanding of the relationship between mental health and illness (e.g.,  schizophrenia, depression) and of the vulnerability and protective factors that contribute to mental illness risk.",Dual Mechanisms of Cognitive Control,9906925,R37MH066078,"['Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Educational Intervention', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Ensure', 'Episodic memory', 'Equation', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Insula of Reil', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mindfulness Training', 'Modeling', 'Monozygotic twins', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychometrics', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resource Sharing', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'causal model', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive enhancement', 'connectome', 'dynamic system', 'flexibility', 'functional disability', 'improved functioning', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'longitudinal design', 'machine learning method', 'mental function', 'mindfulness', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'program dissemination', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills training', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'young adult']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R37,2020,660316,0.011147925025055214
"ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits Project Summary The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix delineates general constructs, that reflect basic dimensions of human behavioral functioning that can range from normal to abnormal. The RDoC matrix organizes these constructs by domains (e.g., positive valence and social processing systems) and units of analysis (i.e., from genes, to molecules, cells, circuits, physiology, behavior, self-report, paradigms) such that they can be systematically studied at multiple levels of analysis. Most clinical research studies, to date, have employed standardized symptom assessments, which are often disorder specific and not directly linked to RDoC constructs. In schizophrenia (SZ), negative symptom domains, including avolition, anhedonia, asociality, alogia, and blunted affect (5 factor model), have been studied in some detail. Recently a theoretical mapping between negative symptom domains and RDoC constructs linked avolition, anhedonia, and avolition to positive valence system, and alogia and flat affect to the social processes system. However, the proposed mappings between behavior (negative symptom domains) and brain structures/circuitry have not been tested or validated; either in SZ, or in other neuropsychiatric illnesses such as bipolar disorder (BD) or major depressive disorder (MDD). Earlier work suggested a more parsimonious 2-factor model of negative symptoms, in which avolition, anhedonia, and asociality were linked to a motivation and pleasure (MAP) factor, and and blunted affect andalogia linked to an expressive (EXP) factor. Of note, with the exception of asociality, these factors appear to map onto positive valence and social processes systems in the RDoC matrix; lending additional support to the proposed RDoC matrix structure related to negative symptoms. Mappings between different interpretations of negative symptom domains (e.g., 5-factor and 2-factor models) and brain structures/circuitry have also not been conducted. Leveraging the worldwide collaborative ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium and the COINSTAC (Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation) computational platform, this proposal will combine neuroimaging and clinical measures of negative symptoms across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD), to validate and extend the RDoC matrix representation of negative symptom domains in major mental illness. We extract joint multimodal features for each separable (sub)construct, evaluate them for their relationship with the behavior, and then use them in a subsequent cross-validation analysis. Subsequently, we evaluate their single subject prediction power. Through these powerful computational methods, we will map structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of brain structures/circuitry to negative symptom behavioral measures. Successful completion of this proposal’s aims will identify distinct and overlapping neural circuits associated with negative symptom domains, will test integrative models of functioning, and identify dysregulation in psychopathology-related mechanisms that cut across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Project Narrative This study is an unprecedented effort that leverages multiple worldwide working groups along with machine learning via a sophisticated decentralized analysis framework. The study findings will validate and extend the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) matrix framework that links negative symptom domains (behavior) -via positive valence and social processing systems and their subconstructs- to brain structures/circuitry (physiology). The findings will yield novel classification approaches for negative symptom severity, may identify novel treatment targets (circuitry), and may yield classifications to stratify patients to treatment conditions.",ENIGMA-COINSTAC: Advanced Worldwide Transdiagnostic Analysis of Valence System Brain Circuits,9988505,R01MH121246,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Aphasia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Face', 'Factor Analysis', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Informatics', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positive Valence', 'Psychopathology', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Social Processes', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Superior temporal gyrus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'computational platform', 'dimensional analysis', 'disability', 'druggable target', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'mood symptom', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient stratification', 'pleasure', 'quality assurance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'social', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'working group']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,932115,-0.0032496971097116635
"Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD Overall Summary The overarching goal of the proposed center is to leverage molecular and circuit biomarkers to advance the understanding of mechanisms and personalized treatment of topiramate treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder comorbid with PTSD. We propose an integrative translational focus on alterations in excitatory and inhibitory signaling, focusing on GABA and glutamate and related circuitry, to model the neurobiology of PTSD comorbid with PTSD and the mitigating effects of topiramate. We will characterize excitatory and inhibitory molecular markers in an animal model of AUD comorbid with PTSD, utilizing genomic markers in the brain and plasma markers in rodents. In clinical trial participants we will characterize excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signaling by ascertaining plasma markers, GRIK 1 genotype and neural circuit markers utilizing TMS evoked potentials in EEG, task-based functional MRI and MR spectroscopy. This goal will be achieved through the activities of three research projects supported by two research cores, the administrative core and the Scientific Advisory Board (Figure1). In Project 1 lead by Silvia Fossati Ph.D. and Jorge Manzanares Robles Ph.D. we will study the behavioral and molecular effects of two doses of topiramate vs. vehicle in animal models of AUD alone, PTSD alone and AUD+PTSD. In Project 2 lead by Michael Bogenschutz M.D. and Joshua Lee M.D. we will study the behavioral, genetic and plasma biomarker effects of topiramate vs. placebo in 150 participants with co-occurring AUD and PTSD. In project 3 lead by Amit Etkin M.D., Ph.D. and Charles R. Marmar M.D. we will ascertain multi-modal imaging markers including task based fMRI, TMS evoked potentials in EEG and MRS. Imaging markers will be used to characterize excitatory and inhibitory circuits in Project 2 clinical trial participants with AUD+PTSD to determine predictors and mechanisms of topiramate vs. placebo treatment outcomes. Plasma biomarkers in Project 2 will be related to the same or homologous plasma biomarkers in Project 1. Circuit markers from Project 3 will be related to genomic markers in the same or homologous brain regions in Project 1. The Biofluids Biomarker Core (BBC) lead by Dr. Fossati will support collection of plasma biomarkers (GABA, glutamate, HPA axis, neuropeptides, neuroinflammatory and oxidative stress) in animals in Project 1 and clinical trial participants in Project 2. The Analytics and Biostatistics Core (ABC) lead by Eugene Laska Ph.D. and Carole Segal Ph.D. will support experimental design, formulation of hypothesis, power calculations, and data integrity, management and analysis for Project 1, 2 and 3, implementing advanced statistical models for individualized prediction of response to topiramate in Project 1 and Project 2. Overall Narrative We aim to advance personalized topiramate treatment for comorbid AUD and PTSD by focusing on network excitatory and inhibitory imbalances underlying heightened negative emotions and impairments in executive function and emotion regulation. Excitatory and inhibitory targets will be assessed with brain, plasma and circuit markers, where possible harmonizing the approach for optimizing discovery of mechanisms and prediction of topiramate treatment in animal models and in clinical trial participants. We will achieve this aim with a center driven approach to discovery with three integrative design elements and four cross-project center aims, creating translational bridges among animal model, clinical trial and imaging studies.",Leveraging biomarkers for personalized treatment of alcohol use disorder comorbid with PTSD,9996319,P01AA027057,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data Analytics', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Equilibrium', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Experimental Designs', 'Formulation', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Placebos', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rodent', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol cue', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical trial participant', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comorbidity', 'data integrity', 'data management', 'design', 'drinking', 'dual diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'genomic biomarker', 'hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein expression', 'response', 'source localization', 'topiramate', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,P01,2020,1202772,-0.019006239656796924
