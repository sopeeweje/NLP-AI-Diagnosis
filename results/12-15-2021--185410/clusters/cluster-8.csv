"DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL HEARING FOR THE DEAF The effort to develop artificial hearing systems for the deaf has recently been focussed on tactual vocoders, devices that transduce acoustic energy into vibratory or electrocutaneous signals which are then applied to the skin.  Current tactual vocoders, however, are based largely upon untested assumptions about optimal filter configurations for speech processing.  In a study which carefully controls device variables (through use of software filters and computer driven displays) while systematically varying filter configurations, perception of critical features of the speech code will be studied.  Using psychophysical techniques, the research seeks to describe the tactual perception of speech features based on signals processed through filter banks with linear, logarithmic and composite spacings for both 32 and 16 channel displays.  The studies will:  1. determine discrimination and identification of speech contrasts along various speech-simulating continua for each of the filter configurations;  2. provide an empirical basis for the design of tactual vocoders with optimal filter configurations; and  3. lay the foundations for a miniaturized tactual vocoder design to be implemented in succeeding phases of the work.  This work is directed toward the development and ultimate manufacture of a portable, wearable, cosmetically acceptable, artificial hearing prosthesis for the deaf.

"AN INTERACTIVE BIOMEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSOR/ANALYZER Current morphometry and image analysis systems can be broadly divided into those which display an image and require the user to trace the points or lines considered significant and those which apply complex algorithms to locate significant objects autonomously.  We have developed a prototype of an intermediate type of system in which the user can rapidly indicate the approximate location of significant objects after which the system applies an edge following algorithm to determine the exact boundary of the object. This system will be much faster to use than ""dumb"" morphometry systems and much less costly than ""intelligent"" image analyzers costing hundreds of thousands of dollars.  This system uses a new VLSI microprocessor specialized for signal processing tasks and innovative image processing circuitry we have designed.  We believe we can design a system of this type to sell for approximately $10,000.  This would bring powerful image processing technology within the reach of many more investigators.

"PHASE II RESEARCH ON SOUND-MAKING PRODUCTS FOR INFANTS The visual ""mobiles"" attached to infant cribs are devices designed to provide the infant with visual stimulation.  There are no devices currently on the market that provide infants with complex and interesting auditory stimulation.  Yet, studies by this research team show that very young infants have a keen sense of hearing and are capable of discriminating fine differences in complex sounds such as speech.  More importantly, our work suggests that infants like listening to speech, particularly when it conforms to the kind of speech that is addressed to them by caretakers. The particular kind of speech has many special properties, and has been given the name ""Motherese.""  Our laboratory research indicates that infants prefer to listen to Motherese over the kind of speech that is addressed to adults.  Moreover, the work shows that the main feature attracting infant attention towards Motherese is its unique acoustic characteristics, indluding an increase in pitch, exaggerated pitch contours, and a slower tempo.  This Phase-I research project proposes to examine the feasibility of creating an ""Auditory Mobile"" for infants--a device that presents Motherese and other complex signals that mimic its salient acoustic characteristics to infants.  The special features of this device include the fact that it is programmable and activated by the infant's vocalizations.  The proposal requests support for research that would further specify the parameters of auditory signals that should be contained in an Auditory Mobile and begin work on the technical problems of speech synthesis and recognition required by the device.

"FISH VENTILATORY BEHAVIOR AS A TOXIC'S MONITORING TOOL The long term objective is to develop a fish monitoring tool capable of rapidly screening chemicals for toxicity, protecting public drinking water supplies and wastewater receiving systems, and identifying the causative toxic agent(s).  Non-invasive electrode techniques receive signals from fish generated bioelectric fields.  Electronic components filter the signals generated from independently monitored fish such that the ventilatory components may be amplified and interfaced to a microcomputer. This and other laboratories have demonstrated that, upon exposure to acutely toxic chemical concentrations, several changes occur in the ventilatory components of fish, such as, frequency, amplitude, and gill purge or cough, including three major and eleven subcategories of the types of gill purge.  It is anticipated that the Phase I research will demonstrate that, upon exposure to chronically toxic chemical concentrations, the combinations of ventilatory components occurring will be unique to a given category of the chemical (e.g., concepts of structural activity relationships, heavy metal vs. pesticide, etc.).  Many chemicals that are toxic to humans and other mammilian systems are toxic to aquatic organisms.  If the long term objective is successful, this inexpensive monitoring tool would have commercal applications for the chemical manufacturing, drinking water and wastewater treatment industries, municipalities, and regulatory agencies, as well as the academic research community.

"STEPPED-CARE COLLEAGUE:  AUTOMATED THERAPY REVIEW IN HYP Clinical decision support systems and medical information systems are both of great interest in medical informatics.  Ideally these two types of systems should be closely linked to provide maximum educational and clinical utility.  Usually medical informatics development emphasizes one type of system to the exclusion of the other.  The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a generic, linked system in which medical knowledge represented in the decision support module is applied in the clinical setting in the context of an existing information system.  The major advantages are practical:  the data required by the decision support system is already available; no special data collection or entry is needed.  The advice given by the decision support system is presented in clinical ""real-time"" to optimize its effect.  The second objective is to maximally exploit non-artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM) systems for representing medical knowledge and decision making processes when appropriate.  This is cost effective and, if sufficiently robust, may be adequate for many types of medical decision problems.  In this proposal we plan to develop general methods and apply them to a single clinical setting:  hypertension care.  The specific work will test the hypothesis that an automated therapeutic management review system may be created, using a non-AIM rule-based structure coupled with a system designed to frequently gather pertinent clinical information, to provide sophisticated analysis of current medical management for providers.  The system will survey current clinical data and, following a stepped care approach to the treatment of hypertension, advise providers as to when they should increase therapy, modify therapy, or reduce therapy in appropriate circumstances.  The prototype system will be studied in a general medicine practice. Testing will involve the examination of its performance in terms of reliability and validity, its psychological impact on providers and their perception of benefit and satisfaction, and its cost and impact on stepped care therapy.  If this development and feasibility project is successful, we will consider submitting a proposal to subject the developed system to more definitive study.

"ARRAY PROCESSOR FOR MEDICAL IMAGE PROCESSING A powerful array processor to be attached to our existing VAX 11/780 computer is requested.  This instrument will be dedicated to research in medical imaging and image processing.  Specifically, four projects are proposed, two each in digital radiology and nuclear medicine.  In digital radiology, the goal of the proposed research is to deblur subtraction angiograms by using sophisticated image processing algorithms, thereby facilitating the visualization of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary arteries.  Two distinct processing algorithms will be investigated.  Both of these algorithms are well known in the image processing leterature, but have not yet been applied to large medical images for lack of sufficient computer power.  The nuclear medicine projects have as their goal earlier detection and more accurate characterization of small neoplasms.  In one of these projects, three-dimensional images will be reconstructed from coded-aperture data.  This approach allows true tomographic reconstruction without any motion of the detector or aperture.  The other nuclear medicine project involves automated feature extraction and pattern recognition of liver scans.  In addition, it will include an attempt to optimize the design of nuclear imaging systems for most accurate extraction of the relevant features.

"COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISE IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS COMPUTER-BASED EXERCISES IN PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC DIAGNOSIS is a research project that aims to develop computer-assisted instructional tools for clinical science education in medicine.  A computer system will be developed that consists of two related programs:  DSS, a user-friendly decision support system, based on the concepts of clinical decision analysis and medical cost-effectiveness analysis; and PLAN-ALYZER, an interactive critiquing system based on the concepts of automated transition networks.  Methods to be employed in the development of the system will arise from decision theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.  The primary computer system that will be used for the project is the Apple Macintosh.  The computer system will be applied to clinical problems in two content areas of second year medical education:  the workup of anemias in hematology and the evaluation and management of suspected coronary artery disease in cardiology.  Databases will be developed for each of these areas, drawing upon the resources of clinical medicine, community and family medicine, and laboratory medicine.  The effect of the computer tool in these two areas will be tested through a randomized, controlled crossover trial in three medical school classes.  Students will be stratified by sex and MCAT Verbal and Quantitative scores into two randomized groups.  The first group will undergo the hematology intervention, and serve as a control group for the cardiology exercise. The other group will serve in reverse.  Experimental subjects will undergo a laboratory exercise using the DSS and PLAN-ALYZER programs; control subjects will receive refined textual material that is equivalent in content.  Performance will be measured by patient evaluation problems built into the examination mechanism of the medical school in the randomized design.  Additionally, student performance will be measured over time, both within the second year intervention and through two repeat interventions in the clinical years of medical school.

"ANALYSIS OF PROBLEMS IN OCULAR INFLAMMATORY DISEASE The major goals of this proposal are the prevention of blindness and of morbidity associated with inflammatory eye diseases, particularly trachoma and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections.  In the studies of trachoma, we will (1) develop improved techniques for treating it, (2) elucidate the role of Chlamydia trachomatis as an agent of systemic illness, particularly childhood pneumonia, in trachoma endemic areas, (3) evaluate new techniques for the rapid, inexpensive diagnosis of chlamydial infections, (4) attempt to further define the immunological response to C. trachomatis infections in trachoma through the use of specific chlamydial antigens.  The hypothesis underlying these studies is that blindness and morbidity associated with endemic trachoma can be prevented, but that will involve new technologies for detection and treatment.  While these studies on ocular chlamydial infection will be directed at practical, applied goals, we also will examine at a basic level the pathogenesis of chronic trachoma.  By defining the antibody response to specific chlamydial antigens and the patterns of cellular response in the eye, we plan to develop a means to identify cases who are at risk of the blinding complications or who will not respond well to chemotherapy.  This knowledge will be needed as a basis for the evaluation of possible subunit trachoma vaccines.  The studies on ocular herpes simplex virus infections will focus on improving the management of this condition by the development of a computer based, artificial intelligence model of HSV eye infections that can be used as an expert consultant for management of herpetic eye disease.  Continued development of this model will elucidate specific problems in the complex management of the disease.

"ULTRASOUND HYPERTHERMIA SYSTEM FOR CANCER THERAPY The goal of this program is to design, develop, and evaluate a state-of-the-art system for ultrasonically inducing local hyperthermia in humans for use in cancer therapy.  The program is composed to several interconnected subgoals which are:  1) To continue development of existing computer programs used for transducer design and beam pattern evaluation, thermal exposure calculations and resulting temperature distributions.  2) To design and evaluate ultrasound transducers that are optimised for inducing hyperthermia.  3) Install transducers with appropriate power supplies and controllers in a modified diagnostic ultrasound scanner.  The central unit is a commercial OCTOSON digital ultrasound imaging system.  We will add a number of additional heating transducers to the gantry in out-rigger fashion.  Each transducer will be separately driven by its own power amplifier and driver.  The drivers will be driven by a micro-processor based control unit.  Temperatures at varius important sites within the patient will be measured with thermocouples or other devices and made available to the operator and to the control unit by means of a data acquisition system.  4) Design and install a hardware and software link between temperature monitoring devices on subjects and the microprocessor controllers within the imager for the purpose of automating the delivery of thermal dose.  5) Evaluate the system with phantoms.  6) Evaluate the system with animals.  The purpose of the animal studies will be two-fold: a) determine whether focused ultrasound can be effectively delivered to deep seated abdominal masses without excessive heating of adjacent critical normal organs.  b) Determine initial antitumor effects and normal tissue toxicities resulting from such treatment in pet animals with spontaneous tumors, i.e. Phase I/II Preclinical Trials.  The animal portion of this project has been planned to solve the technical problems of safely and effectively heating deep seated abdominal tumors with focused ultrasound. 7) Evaluate the system with humans.  a) Evaluate ability of the proposed system to achieve prescribed thermal distributions in human tumors, b) evaluate toxicity associated with the proposed ultrasound hyperthermia technique, c) compare the thermal distributions and temperature patterns achieved with the proposed device to those achieved with other hyperthermia devices, d) evaluate the imaging capability of the device, e) evaluate tumor response rates and duration of response rates and duration of response.

"PHOTOINDUCED THROMBOTIC STROKE--MECHANISMS AND THERAPY The major goal of this project is to document patterns of platelet deposition, blood flow and edema during the development of focal thrombotic stroke, and the effects of prophylactic agents on mitigating or inhibiting thrombus formation in brain vasculature.  A secondary goal is to determine whether lipid peroxidation is associated with thrombotic stroke, and to characterize the distribution of lipid peroxides in parenchyma and endothelium of the affected tissue zone and correlate this with morphological indices as the stroke progresses.  The proposed studies will utilize our recently characterized model of reproducible focal cerebral infarction precipitated by photochemically induced thrombosis of cortical vasculature, in rats injected systemically with the potent photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal.  The progression of thrombosis will be represented by platelets radiolabeled with IIIindium, and local cerebral blood flow will be evaluated by 14C-labeled iodoantipyrine imaging.  Microvascular occlusion will be visualized directly by carbon-black perfusion.  The effect on these parameters of agents known to mitigate thrombosis of single vessels in vivo will be evaluated in the present context of a network of occluded vasculature; such agents include calcium channel antagonists (nimodipine, nifedipine, verapamil), antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, indomethacin, prostacyclin), free radical scavengers (ethanol, dimethylsufoxide, glycerol) and the clot-specific fibrinolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA).  Enhancement of the effect of t-PA by prior administration of lys-plasminogen will be tested also.  The hypothesis that lipid peroxidation inhibits the recovery of tissue compromised by ischemia can be studied if lipid peroxide formation can be induced in specific tissue zones.  In this model it is likely that platelet adhesion and subsequent aggregation are stimulated by photochemical peroxidation of endothelial lipids.  Owing to the reproducible progression of blood flow deficit in the photoinduced lesion, the present model may facilitate stable conditions for lipid peroxidation, observable as conjugated dienes, in the parenchyma as well.  The relative content (predicted to be low) of endothelial lipid peroxides, and the efficiency of photochemical induction of endothelial defects will be determined by similar experiments conducted with endothelial cells in culture.  The proposed work enables rigorous study of the thrombotic process and its mitigation under well-controlled condition in brain microvessels, with consequent benefit to potential stroke patients.

"ANALYSIS OF Z BANDS IN HEART BY OPTICAL DIFFRACTION In human cardiocytes, the contractile units are linked together by Z bands. Although specific proteins have been localized in Z band regions of some vertebrate muscles, the organization of these proteins into a filament lattice is unknown.  Z bands vary in width but the functional significance of this variation remains obscure.  Using optical diffraction methods we have been able to analyze Z and bands greater than 90 nm wide in mammalian cardiac and slow skeletal muscle and have identified a common structural unit.  Our optical reconstruction studies show that these units are added side-to-side and end-to-end to make a regular arrangement of axial and connecting filaments. However, the entire Z band is rarely a uniform lattice.  Optical reconstructions strongly suggest variation in the arrangement of connecting filaments in the Z band at rest length and suggest that the Z band is a dynamic structure.  Our purpose in these studies is to further determine the organization of Z band components in both normal and widened Z bands and to relate this organization to proposed functions for Z bands.  A systematic approach for Z band analysis using goniometer tilt and stereo techniques for electron microscopy at standard and high voltages, together with optical diffraction and reconstruction methods, will be continued.  We will expand our multilevel approach to include studies of Z bands 1)  in normal muscle fixed after repeated stimulation and after fatigue; 2)  in normal muscle partially extracted and reconstituted; 3)  in isolated myofibrils or Z disc sheets and in developing muscle.  Additional techniques to be used are computerized image processing, protein isolation and separation and antibody localization.

Complementing the analysis of marker features in cells coming from normal patients, patients with dysplasia, with carcinoma in situ, and with invasive cancer, a new technique has been developed to measure the ploidy of cells appearing in Papanicolaou smears and histological sections.  It appears that the rapid availability of this new kind of information may add significant, new prognostic dimensions to the diagnostic techniques being developed.  The statistical distribution of the DNA content in individual nuclei has been shown to be significantly correlated with the malignancy of tumors and the patient prognosis.  The high-resolution technique for ploidy measurement is proven to be precise, accurate, and fast.  We have now completed the measurement of 50 cases designated as either dysplastic or having carcinoma in situ.  For each case, this involves the collection of:  (1)\intermediate blue cell images from vaginal, cervical, and endocervical smear preparations; (2)\dysplastic cell images from dysplasia cases; (3)\carcinoma in situ cell images from carcinoma in situ cases; (4)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from the cytology preparations; and (5)\DNA-ploidy patterns of both normal and abnormal cells from histological specimens obtained by biopsy.  DNA results are now routinely produced with a variety of parameters that are being correlated with the results of discriminant analysis on the intermediate blue cell populations.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE A computer-assisted medical decision-making system is an interactive computer system which can directly assist physicians with a clinical decision-making task.  Several of these systems have been developed for use in neurologic problems, with variable success.  These systems have generally not been good models of human diagnostic reasoning, have had difficulty with the coexistance of multiple diseases and have not been capable of sophisticated anatomic reasoning.  Adequate assessment of functioning programs has proven difficult to accomplish and has rarely been performed.  Physician acceptance of these systems has been limited by these and other factors which this research proposal seeks to address.  In the first phase of the proposed research, an existing rule-based CMD system for TIA diagnosis and management will be modified and tested prospectively on 100 patients, utilizing information available on admission and again after their evaluation is complete.  This program will then be incorporated in a more comprehensive system, designed to aid the physician in the diagnosis and management of patients at risk for impending stroke in general.  This comprehensive system will combine a hypothesize-and-test inference mechanism modeled on the clinician's diagnostic reasoning for suggesting diagnoses, with a rule-based method for suggesting plans for patient management.  This system will then be tested utilizing records from the Stroke Data Bank.  The second phase of the proposed research will focus on the development and testing of a computer program for neurologic localization.  Unlike previous programs this will have a well grounded theoretical basis in set cover theory, will employ sophisticated spatial inference and cause-effect reasoning and be capable of answer justification.  Once developed and tested, this program will be incorporated into CMD systems for neurologic diagnosis and management.  The completion of a system with these capabilities will represent an advance in the field of artificial intelligence as well as be of benefit to practicing clinicians and in the education of future physicians.

"CUTANEOUS PATTERN PERCEPTION The proposed research will investigate the skin's ability to perceive tactile patterns.  Using a vibrotactile array of stimulators that fit against the subjects' fingertips, complex patterns varying in duration, mode of generation, intensity, size, temporal proximity to masking stimuli, and location will be presented to subjects who are required to identify the patterns.  The role of pattern onset in generating vibrotactile contours and the limits of temporal integration of vibrotactile patterns will be investigated.  Measurements will be made of temporal masking functions with patterned stimuli, and a two-factor model of masking will be tested. Spatial factors such as the locus of stimulation and the size of patterns as well as the interaction between these factors and temporal and intensive variables will be explored.  The role of experience in tactile pattern recognition will be examined by testing individuals who have had extensive experience with the Optacon, a reading aid for the blind, with some of the pattern recognition tasks on which sighted subjects have been tested.  The project will be concerned with drawing parallels between tactile and visual pattern perception.

To determine what characteristics of patterns provide reliable and rapidly processed units of information, a computer-controlled vibrotactile matrix has been constructed to permit presentation of a wide variety of frequencies, amplitudes, and time relations of tactile stimuli over a spatial display of 64 independently controlled vibrators.  Present explorations of promising pattern dimensions involve serial presentations of patterns for discrimination and identification, but future work will involve pattern production and modification in dynamic simulated environmental representations.

"IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON INDUSTRIAL INSPECTOR STRESS The objective of this research is to determine how both human stress and human performance vary with the level of automation in an industrial inspection job.  Industry is demanding higher quality of its workers and of its inspectors who are charged with maintaining and monitoring that quality.  At the same time, sophisticated automation is becoming available to extend the human inspector's capabilities on some tasks within the inspection job.  Inspection is known to be a stressful job and, with these two trends, a job which is likely to increase in stressfulness.  A machine, called a Color Video Comparator or CVC, will be used to obtain six levels of inspection automation from unaided human inspection through automated display, sequencing and pacing to a pattern-recognition algorithm.  Performance and task stress will be measured in a laboratory task of inspection printed circuit boards for eight subjects at each level of automation.  The procedure follows one already performed successfully at one level for the Western Electric Company.  This company will supply the CVC and the circuit boards used in the study.  Parts of the laboratory study will be replicated using inspectors at two Western Electric plants so that differences between task stress and job stress can be measured.  The results of the project will be of value to designers of automated and semi-automated systems as they will help to specify the level of automation which gives the best balance between system performance and operator stress.

"PROCESSOR CONTROLLED HEARING AID The long term objective of the proposed program is the development, design and manufacture of a signal processor-controlled hearing aid to maintain the overall sound pressure level (SPL) and the spectrum at the eardrum within optimum limits for the hearing impaired individual for allexpected input spectra and input levels.  An additional feature will be an increase in signal-to-noise ratio of the aided signal.  The signal processing will be based on the actual eardrum SPL, determined from an acoustic feedback signal obtained by a microphone or probe in the ear canal.  For all expected input levels, the spectrum of the eardrum sound pressure is controlled by the processor, so that the peak SPL in any 1/3-octave interval does not exceed the individual's loudness discomfort level (LDL) while still maintaining the desired spectrum and SPL at its most effective value.  The processor compares the inputs and outputs for each filter and the gain in each channel is then adjusted (on a real time basis) to obtain the desired output for the band.  Determination of averaging times for both the input and output signals are significant and will constitute a major element in the study.  Phase I objective is to breadboard this system (without) the signal-to-noise ratio improvement) and test it on a manikin, equipped with a ANSI S3.25-1979 simulator.

"NEURO-IMAGING EXPERT SYSTEM It is proposed to develop a computerized expert system for analyzing and understanding the images of the nervous system generated by neuroimaging techniques such as computerized tomography (CT).  A prototype version, called RAD (Radiologic Automatic Diagnosis), has been implemented.  RAD will serve as an expert consultant in the field of neuroradiology, as an adjunct to computerized expert systems for medical diagnosis, and as an intelligent image processor supporting automated feature extraction from neuro-images.  Modern neuroimaging techniques have revolutionized the practice of neurology and neurosurgery.  The rapid proliferation of scanners, however, has outstripped the supply of experts with special training in scan interpretation.  If a scanner could produce the differential diagnosis associated with the radiographs, it could aid radiologists in diagnostic tasks.  Images received in digitized form from scanning devices will be segmented into objects after thresholding based on radiodensity (CT scans).  This process will be aided by intelligent histogram optimizers and artifact removal programs.  Analysis will be conducted in an object-oriented programming environment on objects represented in quadtree or octree format.  RAD will employ clinical information, and knowledge bases in neuroanatomy, neuroradiology, neurology, and medicine to establish a context for analysis.  This context will be instantiated in the form of assertions on a queue of beliefs in a truth maintenance system.  Global and local image analyzers will also make assertions about neuro-images.  The truth maintenance system will keep track of any contradictions which arise, and will provide forward chaining and backtracking explanation abilities of the reasoning leading to the differential diagnosis.  At the present time, medical diagnostic expert systems, such as INTERNIST-I/CADUCEUS are dependent for its input upon the physician-user. The ability to directly interact with patient data in neuro-images would enrich the diagnostic foundation of the system and reduce obligate user interaction.

"A ROTATING SLIT SCANNING UNIT FOR DIGITAL RADIOGRAPHY The purpose of the research we are proposing is the development of a rotational slit scanning system for digital radiographic applications.  The x-ray receptors will consist of linear photodiode arrays coated with an x-ray phosphor.  The system should be compact and of low cost compared to commercially available linear scanning units.  The spatial resolution imaging capabilities of such a device should exceed one 1p/mm, while offering shorter scan times than conventional linear scanning units.  The benefits expected from such a system would include:  1. significant reduction in the detection of compton scattered x-rays (which will degrade image contrast and increase dose)  2. scan rates sufficient to minimize many patient motion problems  3. an increase in the dynamic range available over that of film  4. adequate spatial resolution for many radiologic applications  Since the same coated arrays may be employed in a linear scan format, direct comparison of image quality between the two scanning formats for the same receptor technology will be possible.

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid. Gastric mucosal damage, its healing and mucosal protection will be assessed:  A) macroscopically by scoring and computerized image analysis B) histologically with morphometric quantitation of necrosis C) by determination of mucosal cell proliferation kinetics D) ultrastructurally with scanning and transmission electromicroscopy E) functionally by measurements of ionic fluxes, potential difference and intragastric pH, and F) biochemically by measurements of luminal loss of DNA, protein and blood and the concentration or prostaglandins in the gastric contents.  TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISM(S) OF EFA PROMOTED GASTRIC MUCOSAL PROTECTION WE PLAN TO STUDY:  (1) THE EFFECT OF DNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS INHIBITORS AND OF MICROTUBULES AND MICROFILAMENTS DISRUPTIVE AGENTS ON EFA PROTECTION; (2) RESISTANCE OF RESTORED SURFACE EPITHELIUM TO SUBSEQUENT INJURY; (3) ACTION OF EFA ON ISOLATED GASTRIC MUCOSAL CELLS (SURFACE, PROLIFERATIVE ZONE) THEIR VIABILITY AND ABILITY TO GENERATE PROSTAGLANDINS.

"MEDIATORS OF INSULIN-DEPENDENT MESSENGER RNA SYNTHESIS Insulin prevents the induction of mRNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dubutyryl cyclic AMP and hydrocortisone in Reuber hepatoma cells but simultaneously acts in an additive fashion with these agents in inducing tyrosine aminotransferase.  These results imply that these agents interact to promote or inhibit mRNA production from specific genes. Therefore, this project will test the idea that insulin, cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids alter production of specific messenger RNAs in Reuber hepatoma cells by altering the charge, abundance or intracellular distribution of genetic regulatory proteins.  Two model proteins that translocate to the nucleus and are probably involved in transcriptional regulation (the glucocorticoid receptor and type II cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase) will be identified in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels (2D-PAGE) of radiolabeled extracts of whole cells, nuclei and chromatin. These proteins will be studied to find whether hormonal combinations that alter mRNA induction alter their activation or translocation to the nucleus.  Activation will be sought as changes in the charge (phosphorylation state or other modification) of these receptors using 2D-PAGE.  Translocation will be detected as decreased association of these proteins with the cytosol and increased association with the nucleus after hormonal stimulation, again identifying the receptors with 2D-PAGE.  Cells will be treated with insulin to identify molecules whose charge or abundance is regulated by this hormone, and a molecule will be sought that becomes associated with chromatin after insulin treatment.  Nuclear events such as translocation of regulatory molecules or altered phosphorylation of histones and other proteins will be identified and attempts will be made to correlate these events with altered production of messenger RNAs.  Events that correlate with insulin's ability to abolish the induction of messenger RNA for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by dibutyryl cyclic AMP and glucocorticoids, will be pursued.  If a putative regulator is found, I will attempt to purify it, study how it is activated, and determine how it associates with chromatin or DNA.  Knowledge of how protein effectors are stimulated by insulin to regulate genetic events is fundamental to the understanding of long-term changes brought about by insulin, and conversely, of changes expected in the course of diabetes.

"MOLECULAR BIOLOGY COMPUTER RESOURCE AND RESEARCH PROGRAM The project is a molecular biology computer Resource for the Northeastern United States, coupled with a Research program on computer pattern recognition in molecular genetics.  The Research has two main objectives. One is to develop statistical and computer methods that can reveal syntactic and semantic patterns in DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, most of which are still obscure or unknown.  The other is to use such pattern analysis tools - those developed in the course of the project and others that are deemed appropriate - to discover sequences that trace evolution and that regulate the expression of important genes and gene families.  The identification of such sequences should provoke the formulation and testing of major hypotheses in molecular evolution, gene regulation and developmental genetics.  The molecular biology computer Resource provides these DNA, RNA, and protein sequence analysis tools - and all others that are demonstrably valid and useful and freely available - to investigators within this region on-line, and to the larger research community on magnetic media.  On-line access is through computers at the Resource site, and the programs distributed on tapes and floppy disks are for micro, supermicro, mini, and mainframe computers running under UNIX and other operating systems.  The resource trains molecular biologists in statistics and computer methods, and educates biomathematicians and computer scientists in contemporary molecular genetics.  Research opportunities combining these disciplines are offered yearly to postdoctoral fellows, and quarterly to visiting scientists.  In addition, the Northeast and Los Alamos Resources (the Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory that is responsible for GenBank) will co-sponsor an international symposium on computer analysis in molecular evolution, gene regulation, and developmental genetics in 1985.

"PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION RESOURCE We propose to develop a protein identification resource.  It will contain an expert computer system for protein identification, which will incorporate and identification paradigm, suitable computer programs, organizational structures (including correlations and patterns in the information) and protein sequences, amino acid compositions, and ancillary biochemical and biological knowledge.  We also propose to develop a system of programs to make predictions of medical significance based mainly on the Resource knowledge, including secondary structure, antigenic sites, recognition domains and cross-reactivity of antibodies, best nucleic acid sequence probes, and possible restriction enzyme cut sites of coding regions.  Finally, we plan to develop a computer system using the knowledge base that will facilitate associative browsing, the development of scientific insight, and the rejection of false hypotheses.  Collaborative research will involve two theoretical projects to quantitate the use of additional data, from amino acid composition and from predicted secondary structures, to improve the power of the identification system.  The other two projects involve the examination of new kinds of experimental data to make identifications.  A workshop on computer methods will be held in the first year to suggest new collaborative projects.  We will continue the on-line public access to our protein sequence knowledge base.  We will publish a Newsletter to familiarize users with the system.  Our goal is to develop a system so easy to use that biochemists all over the worls will perform their own routine identifications using telephone networks.

"LONG-TERM PLASMA EXCHANGE IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEM The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very massive reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.  The substantial decrease and improved long term control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol by RPE coupled with hypocholesterolemic drugs should amplify the preliminary evidence which has indicated that regression of early femoral atherosclerosis and nonprogression of advanced coronary lesions can be achieved by drug treatment alone in heterozygous FH.  We propose to undertake long-term (four years) RPE at two week intervals in fifteen heterozygous subjects with FH.  Pretreatment and within treatment coronary atheromatous lesions and ventricular function and perfusion will be assessed by serial quantitative, computerized coronary angiography, rest and exercise Thallium-201 perfusion studies, respectively.  The effectiveness of RPE will be judged not only by longitudinal studies of the plasma exchange group, but also in a randomized concurrent control group of subjects receiving only maximal drug therapy.  In addition, comparison will also be made against two groups of patients (historical controls) selected by Dr. John Brensike from the type II coronary intervention study recently completed at the NIH.

The subjects will have undergone cardiac catheterization at the start of the study, at two years after entry, and at five years after entry.  In effect, therefore, the results of repeat coronary angiography in fifteen patients who undergo massive reductions in plasma cholesterol by REP plus maximal drug therapy will be compared to three control groups: a randomized concurrently treated group (diet plus maximal drug therapy), and two historical NIH concurrently treated groups (one with dietary treatment only, and a group on diet plus cholestyramine).

"DIGITAL CONTROL OF REHABILITATION/EXERCISE MACHINES The long term objectives of this work are twofold.  First, to develop adaptive machines which can be used effectively in the evaluation and rehabilitation of muscular deficits due to traluma, disuse or disease in a broad spectrum of the population from victims of accidents and chronic musculoskeletal disorders to atheletes and the aged.  Second, to collaborate with health professionals in collecting and analyzing data, using the unique capabilities of these devices, and to establish a database to make these data readily accessible.  Thus, these machines should be versatile, incorporating active as well as passive exercise capacity, and capable of collecting, archiving, manipulating and comparing quantitative measurements from treatment protocols.  The specific aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of developing an intelligent, digital controller, based upon computer architecture widely used and supported in the industrial process control and biomedical communities.  The controller must be capable of accurate, on-line, feedback regulation of previously developed instrumented machines.  The latter permit motion in three dimensions and employ electrohydraulic control of resistance.  To accomplish this specific aim, several steps are required.  Initially, the dynamic performance of the electrohydraulic actuator unit must be characterized using standard control engineering test protocols.  Next, a prototype test system can be assembled by interfacing a minicomputer with one of the instrumented machines and allowing the computer to emulate digital controller functions.  By varying such parameters as sampling rate, data precision and feedback functions, software/hardware constraints will be established.  Finally, a configuration will be outlined specifying the requisite hardware and software components which will provide acceptable control performance.

"COMPREHENDING SENTENCES WITH LONG-DISTANCE DEPENDENCIES To understand the sentence ""Who did the girl the teacher forced to talk complain to?""  One must determine that ""the girl"" is to be taken as the missing subject of the verb ""talk"" and that ""who"" is the missing object of the preposition ""to.""  Sentences with such long-distance dependencies as that between ""the girl"" and the subject position preceding ""to talk"" pose special problems for theories of sentence comprehension.  They challenge the apparent human limits on short-term memory and processing capacity, in that arbitrary amounts of linguistic material can intervene between the items that are dependent upon each other and any one sentence can contain several long-distance dependencies.  Further, they are subject to unique linguistic constraints that a language user must honor.  We propose experiments to study the comprehension of sentences with long-distance dependencies, using reaction time and other measures of processing difficulty. Our goals are to determine what decision principles people follow in understanding such sentences, to identify the various types of information (lexical, pragmatic, suprasegmental, grammatical constraints) they use in making decisions about long-distance dependencies, and to specify the sequence in which they use functionally different types of information.

"BREAST DIAGNOSIS:  QUANTITATIVE IMAGING BY ULTRASOUND The goal of this proposal is to develop and investigate methods and instruments for obtaining reliable quantitative ultrasound images of several acoustic paramenters within two-dimensional coronal cross sections of the breasts of women.  The instrument and associated programs will synergistically combine quantitative multimodal images to obtain diagnoses of breast disease.  Ultrasound computer-assisted transmission tomography will be utilized to obtain quantitative images of acoustic speed, acoustic attenuation, acoustic absorption and scatter and reflection where appropriate.  Both analytic and iterative methods of correcting aberrations in the images caused by inhomogeneous refractive index will be investigated.  Compound B-scan images will also be obtained in the same coronal planes.  Our clinical scanner will be modified to obtain data necessary for high fidelity images derived using newly developed inverse scattering methods.  Patients scheduled for surgical biopsy will be scanned and the resulting images compared to the histology results from biopsy and/or surgical mastectomy.  Comparisons between surgical specimens and acoustic images will be made using methods of automated computer-assisted pattern classification and recognition combined with histological methods of tissue preparation specifically designed to aid in comparing ultrasound images of the coronal plane of the intact breast with similar planes through the excised breast.  This parallel investigation of the clinical instrument, inverse scattering methods, histologic tissue analysis techniques, and pattern recognition programs should result in complete evaluation of the prototype clinical scanner and may result in an instruemnt design capable for use in the clinical environment.

"BIOMEDICAL USE OF PLASMA DESORPTION MASS SPECTROMETRY The specific aim of the proposed research is to continue to develop the analytical capability of 252Cf-plasma desorption mass spectrometry for biomedical research involving large biomolecules (m/z greater than 5000). Part of the plan is to change the method of sample preparation so that the formation of molecular ions from the substrate will be less dependent on matrix effects and at the same time will improve sensitivity to the picomole level.  The new method of sample preparation will utilize adsorption of proteins (insulin and cytochrome-C) onto polymeric surfaces from liquid solutions.  The interaction will be analyzed using phase equilibrium thermodynamics to evaluate equilibrium constants, DeltaH, and DeltaS for adsorption.  These same surfaces will become samples for 252Cf-PDMS analysis.  Fractional coverage will be determined by 252Cf-PDMS.  A general study of polymer-protein surface thermodynamics will be carried out using 252Cf-PDMS as an analytical method.  Two important protein systems, interferon and hemoglobin, have been targeted as the next model compounds for extending the mass range and capabilities of 252Cf-PDMS.  Some feasibility studies will be carried out to determine whether 252Cf-PDMS might be used to study antibody-antigen interactions and receptor sites on cell surfaces.  The studies of protein-polymer interactions have relevance to the genesis of atherosclerosis.

"QUANTITATIVE GAIT ANALYSIS Quantitative gait analysis using computer aided videomotion analysis, force plates and electromyography is of recognized value in assessment of gait disabilities and in quantitative evaluation of treatment.  But, despite dramatic improvements in techniques, gait analysis still lacks widespread clinical utility because of uncertainties relating to data selection, manipulation, and analysis.  Since data acquisition is usually limited to a single test session over several gait cycles, one vital problem concerns selection of a gait cycle for analysis that is representative of the patient's gait and determination of its reliability as a basis for clinical decision making.  Another problem relates to the manipulation of large quantities of data generated by measurements of various kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic parameters over several gait cycles to detect clinically significant patterns of performance.  This process is further complicated by the fact that gait patterns vary among patients with the same syndorme and to a certain extent, vary even among normals. Interpretration may be simplified by using statistical pattern recognition techniques, but for a pattern recognition approach to be successful, the enormous quantity of data must be reduced to a parsimonious set of features which describe gait patterns accurately.  Furthermore, representation of graphic patterns associated with various gait parameters in terms of a discrete set of variables would make numerical comparison more meaningful.  The first part of this study will investigate repeatability and clinical reliability of selected kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic parameters obtained from repeated gait analyses on normal subjects and two representative groups of orthopaedic patients, using a statistical criterion (variance ratio).  The feasibility of using the variance ratio as a criterion for averaging gait cycles to yield a representative cycle also will be examined.  The second part of the study will deal with the application of principal component analysis for representing gait patterns in a concise manner, as an initial step to application of pattern recognition techniques.  The effectiveness of the derived features in representing gait abnormalities will be evaluated using the same normal and orthopaedic patient subjects.  It is anticipated that the results of the proposed study will enhance the clinical effectiveness of quantitative gait analysis by defining practical computer algorithms for selecting and assessing reliability of raw gait data, and by defining techniques for feature selection that can be used effectively in pattern recognition techniques.

"DESIGN OF IMPROVED ACOUSTIC IMAGING TRANSDUCERS The purpose of this work is to greatly improve the performance of ultrasonic imaging transducers.  Improvements are anticipated in range, and clarity of images, especially of chest cavity images, which require the greatest range of clarity.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred. While a substantial body of evidence indicates that altered DNA plays a major role in this process, the role of non-DNA factors has also been demonstrated.  In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time. Silver and in vitro radiolabeling techniques have been developed to permit visualization of nanogram amounts of protein(s) with applicability to computer technology.  Using these techniques, we have identified induction of tumor-associated proteins (TAP) in the total NHCP fraction as well as in the phenol-soluble fraction (phosphoproteins) of rat hepatic chromatins during AAF and DEN carcinogenesis and resulting hepatocellular carcinomas. Additionally, cytosolic AAF and DEN-TAPs have been similarly demonstrated. We will determine to what extent these changes in NHCP and cytosolic proteins characterize the general process of carcinogenesis by examining spontaneous and chemically-induced hepatic and thymus tumors in a variety of mouse inbred strains.  We will further determine the time of appearance, sub-fraction location, and in the case of NHCP, genomic distribution of TAP during chemical carcinogenesis; isolate these proteins, and produce monoclonal antibodies for use in their study, as well as determining their functional significance.  Lastly, we will continue our technological developments to assure maximum detection, and computer-assisted image-processing of the complex protein patterns that characterize normal and malignant cells in order to confirm and further detect potential hallmark proteins, whose occurrence mark malignant induction.

In the studies of chlamydial infections we will (1) initiate studies on the role of individual host response to chlamydial infection; (2) elucidate the role of Chlamydia trachomatis as a cause of other illness in trachoma endemic areas; (3) evaluate new technology for the diagnosis of ocular chlamydial infections; (4) develop and validate simplified diagnostic techniques for endemic trachoma; (5) continue limited treatment trials for the prevention of blindness from trachoms.  The major theme of these studies on trachoma will be an evaluation of the host response to infection of the conjunctiva.  An important intermediate goal will be the identification of those host factors that are associated with the blingind consequences of trachoma.  Herpes simplex virus and other infections of the eye continue to be a major problem, both in the United States and in other countries.  Although treatment of ocular herpes has improved considerably in recent years, the disease continues to cause loss of vision and morbidity in many patients. In order to improve treatment of this disease by ophthalmologists, further refinements will be made in a computer model to provide treatment recommendations for herpetic eye disease.  Similar models will be developed to give treatment advice in other forms of suppurative keratitis and for the treatment of eye problems by primary health workers in developing countries.

"PHOTOINDUCED THROMBOTIC STROKE--MECHANISMS AND THERAPY The major goal of this project is to document patterns of platelet deposition, blood flow and edema during the development of focal thrombotic stroke, and the effects of prophylactic agents on mitigating or inhibiting thrombus formation in brain vasculature.  A secondary goal is to determine whether lipid peroxidation is associated with thrombotic stroke, and to characterize the distribution of lipid peroxides in parenchyma and endothelium of the affected tissue zone and correlate this with morphological indices as the stroke progresses.  The proposed studies will utilize our recently characterized model of reproducible focal cerebral infarction precipitated by photochemically induced thrombosis of cortical vasculature, in rats injected systemically with the potent photosensitizing dye Rose Bengal.  The progression of thrombosis will be represented by platelets radiolabeled with IIIindium, and local cerebral blood flow will be evaluated by 14C-labeled iodoantipyrine imaging.  Microvascular occlusion will be visualized directly by carbon-black perfusion.  The effect on these parameters of agents known to mitigate thrombosis of single vessels in vivo will be evaluated in the present context of a network of occluded vasculature; such agents include calcium channel antagonists (nimodipine, nifedipine, verapamil), antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, indomethacin, prostacyclin), free radical scavengers (ethanol, dimethylsufoxide, glycerol) and the clot-specific fibrinolytic agent, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA).  Enhancement of the effect of t-PA by prior administration of lys-plasminogen will be tested also.  The hypothesis that lipid peroxidation inhibits the recovery of tissue compromised by ischemia can be studied if lipid peroxide formation can be induced in specific tissue zones.  In this model it is likely that platelet adhesion and subsequent aggregation are stimulated by photochemical peroxidation of endothelial lipids.  Owing to the reproducible progression of blood flow deficit in the photoinduced lesion, the present model may facilitate stable conditions for lipid peroxidation, observable as conjugated dienes, in the parenchyma as well.  The relative content (predicted to be low) of endothelial lipid peroxides, and the efficiency of photochemical induction of endothelial defects will be determined by similar experiments conducted with endothelial cells in culture.  The proposed work enables rigorous study of the thrombotic process and its mitigation under well-controlled condition in brain microvessels, with consequent benefit to potential stroke patients.

"KINEMATIC AND CELLULAR STUDIES OF MOTOR CONTROL The main goal is to understand how the central nervous system coordinates the large number of degrees of freedom of the arm.  The experimental approach includes recording and analysis of the kinematics of multijoint movements.  In some cases, a simple mechanical system is used to record the movements.  When full arm freedom is required, an optoelectric recording system is used.  Work will continue on the following projects on multijoint control.  1. Multijoint movements of the right and left arms are being compared.  The comparison includes movements to visual targets, movements which are unexpectedly perturbed, and isometric force production.  2. Studies of the multijoint movements of patients with movement disorders will be continued.  To date, there has been concentration on patients with cerebellar disease and Parkinson's disease.  Simple movements to visual targets have been emphasized.  In the next year, unexpectedly perturbed movements and isometric force production will be studied in these same patient groups, in order to more fully characterize the physiology of these disorders.  3. We are studying the control of multijoint movements in the presence of unexpected mechanical loads.  We recently found that with same load types subjects make movements with the same kinematic characteristics as in the unloaded condition.  This suggests that there may be a mechanism for rapid real-time trajectory corrections, so that we will investigate this motor-compensation mechanism more fully.  4. The multijoint arm stiffness of patients with a variety of central lesions will be compared to that of normal individuals.  By searching for changes in the stiffness due to central diseases, we hope to learn what central structures are involved in stiffness control.

"NEURO-IMAGING EXPERT SYSTEM It is proposed to develop a computerized expert system for analyzing and understanding the images of the nervous system generated by neuroimaging techniques such as computerized tomography (CT).  A prototype version, called RAD (Radiologic Automatic Diagnosis), has been implemented.  RAD will serve as an expert consultant in the field of neuroradiology, as an adjunct to computerized expert systems for medical diagnosis, and as an intelligent image processor supporting automated feature extraction from neuro-images.  Modern neuroimaging techniques have revolutionized the practice of neurology and neurosurgery.  The rapid proliferation of scanners, however, has outstripped the supply of experts with special training in scan interpretation.  If a scanner could produce the differential diagnosis associated with the radiographs, it could aid radiologists in diagnostic tasks.  Images received in digitized form from scanning devices will be segmented into objects after thresholding based on radiodensity (CT scans).  This process will be aided by intelligent histogram optimizers and artifact removal programs.  Analysis will be conducted in an object-oriented programming environment on objects represented in quadtree or octree format.  RAD will employ clinical information, and knowledge bases in neuroanatomy, neuroradiology, neurology, and medicine to establish a context for analysis.  This context will be instantiated in the form of assertions on a queue of beliefs in a truth maintenance system.  Global and local image analyzers will also make assertions about neuro-images.  The truth maintenance system will keep track of any contradictions which arise, and will provide forward chaining and backtracking explanation abilities of the reasoning leading to the differential diagnosis.  At the present time, medical diagnostic expert systems, such as INTERNIST-I/CADUCEUS are dependent for its input upon the physician-user. The ability to directly interact with patient data in neuro-images would enrich the diagnostic foundation of the system and reduce obligate user interaction.

"CENTER FOR STUDY OF CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE & STROKE This is a competitive continuation proposal for a Center for the Study of Cerebrovascular Disease and Stroke.  The goals are the prevention of stroke and the development of effective treatment for stroke and its consequences.  Both laboratory studies and clinical studies are outlined in the request.  We propose to study, by the use of appropriate animal models problems of the blood vessels supplying the brain that cannot be well studied in humans.  These projects relate to:  1) the routes of fluid and solute transfer between blood vessels and perivascular space; 2) changes produced in blood vessels by hypertension and diabetes and the development of vascular disease over time as shown by scanning and electron microscopy; 3) the alteration in the endothelial cell glycocalyx that are caused by hemodynamic changes and may underlie the location of atherosclerosis or clots.  The clinically related projects use the techniques of artificial intelligence in computer aided decision making, data banking and clinical study of patients with the tools of psychiatry and neuropsychology.  These projects will utilize data collected from a group of stroke patients to study:  1) aphasia and the cognitive deficit underlying it, the current classification and aspects of symptom change in recovery; 2) depression poststroke including the identification of risk factors, the biological correlates, comparison with control groups, genetics, and treatment; 3) computer aided decision making in stroke including development of new artificial intelligence techniques, developing and testing multiple computer programs to assist in assessing and managing patients with stroke and develop new ways of using these systems in clinical and educational settings.

"QUANTITATIVE GAIT ANALYSIS Quantitative gait analysis using computer aided videomotion analysis, force plates and electromyography is of recognized value in assessment of gait disabilities and in quantitative evaluation of treatment.  But, despite dramatic improvements in techniques, gait analysis still lacks widespread clinical utility because of uncertainties relating to data selection, manipulation, and analysis.  Since data acquisition is usually limited to a single test session over several gait cycles, one vital problem concerns selection of a gait cycle for analysis that is representative of the patient's gait and determination of its reliability as a basis for clinical decision making.  Another problem relates to the manipulation of large quantities of data generated by measurements of various kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic parameters over several gait cycles to detect clinically significant patterns of performance.  This process is further complicated by the fact that gait patterns vary among patients with the same syndorme and to a certain extent, vary even among normals. Interpretration may be simplified by using statistical pattern recognition techniques, but for a pattern recognition approach to be successful, the enormous quantity of data must be reduced to a parsimonious set of features which describe gait patterns accurately.  Furthermore, representation of graphic patterns associated with various gait parameters in terms of a discrete set of variables would make numerical comparison more meaningful.  The first part of this study will investigate repeatability and clinical reliability of selected kinetic, kinematic and electromyographic parameters obtained from repeated gait analyses on normal subjects and two representative groups of orthopaedic patients, using a statistical criterion (variance ratio).  The feasibility of using the variance ratio as a criterion for averaging gait cycles to yield a representative cycle also will be examined.  The second part of the study will deal with the application of principal component analysis for representing gait patterns in a concise manner, as an initial step to application of pattern recognition techniques.  The effectiveness of the derived features in representing gait abnormalities will be evaluated using the same normal and orthopaedic patient subjects.  It is anticipated that the results of the proposed study will enhance the clinical effectiveness of quantitative gait analysis by defining practical computer algorithms for selecting and assessing reliability of raw gait data, and by defining techniques for feature selection that can be used effectively in pattern recognition techniques.

"CHROMOSOMAL PROTEINS DURING CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS Administration of many chemical agents results in induction of malignant tumors in target tissues.  These malignancies are characterized by alterations in control of cellular function, suggesting that genomic alteration (mutation) and/or alterations in gene modulation have occurred. While a substantial body of evidence indicates that altered DNA plays a major role in this process, the role of non-DNA factors has also been demonstrated.  In this continuation, we will extend our two-dimensional gel electrophoretic study of potentially critical alterations occurring in nonhistone chromosomal proteins (NHCP) and cytosolic proteins during carcinogenesis induced by diverse acting carcinogens acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and in the cancers that result.  We have demonstrated that the gel system provides a highly consistent pattern of protein separation, with extreme resolution, over long periods of time. Silver and in vitro radiolabeling techniques have been developed to permit visualization of nanogram amounts of protein(s) with applicability to computer technology.  Using these techniques, we have identified induction of tumor-associated proteins (TAP) in the total NHCP fraction as well as in the phenol-soluble fraction (phosphoproteins) of rat hepatic chromatins during AAF and DEN carcinogenesis and resulting hepatocellular carcinomas. Additionally, cytosolic AAF and DEN-TAPs have been similarly demonstrated. We will determine to what extent these changes in NHCP and cytosolic proteins characterize the general process of carcinogenesis by examining spontaneous and chemically-induced hepatic and thymus tumors in a variety of mouse inbred strains.  We will further determine the time of appearance, sub-fraction location, and in the case of NHCP, genomic distribution of TAP during chemical carcinogenesis; isolate these proteins, and produce monoclonal antibodies for use in their study, as well as determining their functional significance.

"MOLECULAR BIOLOGY COMPUTER RESOURCE AND RESEARCH PROGRAM The project is a molecular biology computer Resource for the Northeastern United States, coupled with a Research program on computer pattern recognition in molecular genetics.  The Research has two main objectives. One is to develop statistical and computer methods that can reveal syntactic and semantic patterns in DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, most of which are still obscure or unknown.  The other is to use such pattern analysis tools - those developed in the course of the project and others that are deemed appropriate - to discover sequences that trace evolution and that regulate the expression of important genes and gene families.  The identification of such sequences should provoke the formulation and testing of major hypotheses in molecular evolution, gene regulation and developmental genetics.  The molecular biology computer Resource provides these DNA, RNA, and protein sequence analysis tools - and all others that are demonstrably valid and useful and freely available - to investigators within this region on-line, and to the larger research community on magnetic media.  On-line access is through computers at the Resource site, and the programs distributed on tapes and floppy disks are for micro, supermicro, mini, and mainframe computers running under UNIX and other operating systems.  The resource trains molecular biologists in statistics and computer methods, and educates biomathematicians and computer scientists in contemporary molecular genetics.  Research opportunities combining these disciplines are offered yearly to postdoctoral fellows, and quarterly to visiting scientists.  In addition, the Northeast and Los Alamos Resources (the Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory that is responsible for GenBank) will co-sponsor an international symposium on computer analysis in molecular evolution, gene regulation, and developmental genetics in 1985.

"COMPREHENDING SENTENCES WITH LONG-DISTANCE DEPENDENCIES To understand the sentence ""Who did the girl the teacher forced to talk complain to?""  One must determine that ""the girl"" is to be taken as the missing subject of the verb ""talk"" and that ""who"" is the missing object of the preposition ""to.""  Sentences with such long-distance dependencies as that between ""the girl"" and the subject position preceding ""to talk"" pose special problems for theories of sentence comprehension.  They challenge the apparent human limits on short-term memory and processing capacity, in that arbitrary amounts of linguistic material can intervene between the items that are dependent upon each other and any one sentence can contain several long-distance dependencies.  Further, they are subject to unique linguistic constraints that a language user must honor.  We propose experiments to study the comprehension of sentences with long-distance dependencies, using reaction time and other measures of processing difficulty. Our goals are to determine what decision principles people follow in understanding such sentences, to identify the various types of information (lexical, pragmatic, suprasegmental, grammatical constraints) they use in making decisions about long-distance dependencies, and to specify the sequence in which they use functionally different types of information.

"BIOMEDICAL USE OF PLASMA DESORPTION MASS SPECTROMETRY The specific aim of the proposed research is to continue to develop the analytical capability of 252Cf-plasma desorption mass spectrometry for biomedical research involving large biomolecules (m/z greater than 5000). Part of the plan is to change the method of sample preparation so that the formation of molecular ions from the substrate will be less dependent on matrix effects and at the same time will improve sensitivity to the picomole level.  The new method of sample preparation will utilize adsorption of proteins (insulin and cytochrome-C) onto polymeric surfaces from liquid solutions.  The interaction will be analyzed using phase equilibrium thermodynamics to evaluate equilibrium constants, DeltaH, and DeltaS for adsorption.  These same surfaces will become samples for 252Cf-PDMS analysis.  Fractional coverage will be determined by 252Cf-PDMS.  A general study of polymer-protein surface thermodynamics will be carried out using 252Cf-PDMS as an analytical method.  Two important protein systems, interferon and hemoglobin, have been targeted as the next model compounds for extending the mass range and capabilities of 252Cf-PDMS.  Some feasibility studies will be carried out to determine whether 252Cf-PDMS might be used to study antibody-antigen interactions and receptor sites on cell surfaces.  The studies of protein-polymer interactions have relevance to the genesis of atherosclerosis.  Specific interactions between proteins and receptor sites are fundamental to the immune response in humans and in understanding the role of proteins such as insulin in triggering a response within a cell when it attaches to a receptor site.

"PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION RESOURCE We propose to develop a protein identification resource.  It will contain an expert computer system for protein identification, which will incorporate and identification paradigm, suitable computer programs, organizational structures (including correlations and patterns in the information) and protein sequences, amino acid compositions, and ancillary biochemical and biological knowledge.  We also propose to develop a system of programs to make predictions of medical significance based mainly on the Resource knowledge, including secondary structure, antigenic sites, recognition domains and cross-reactivity of antibodies, best nucleic acid sequence probes, and possible restriction enzyme cut sites of coding regions.  Finally, we plan to develop a computer system using the knowledge base that will facilitate associative browsing, the development of scientific insight, and the rejection of false hypotheses.  Collaborative research will involve two theoretical projects to quantitate the use of additional data, from amino acid composition and from predicted secondary structures, to improve the power of the identification system.  The other two projects involve the examination of new kinds of experimental data to make identifications.  A workshop on computer methods will be held in the first year to suggest new collaborative projects.  We will continue the on-line public access to our protein sequence knowledge base.  We will publish a Newsletter to familiarize users with the system.  Our goal is to develop a system so easy to use that biochemists all over the worls will perform their own routine identifications using telephone networks.  The great explosion in the accumulation of structural data bears witness that investigators, over 4,000 of them, think that the information is important in their many different fields including virology, immunology, pharmacology, oncology, genetics, genetic engineering, biochemistry, physiology, and pathology.  Protein structures contain important information required for understanding the causes of disease and developing a rational approach to treatment.

"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE A computer-assisted medical decision-making system is an interactive computer system which can directly assist physicians with a clinical decision-making task.  Several of these systems have been developed for use in neurologic problems, with variable success.  These systems have generally not been good models of human diagnostic reasoning, have had difficulty with the coexistance of multiple diseases and have not been capable of sophisticated anatomic reasoning.  Adequate assessment of functioning programs has proven difficult to accomplish and has rarely been performed.  Physician acceptance of these systems has been limited by these and other factors which this research proposal seeks to address.  In the first phase of the proposed research, an existing rule-based CMD system for TIA diagnosis and management will be modified and tested prospectively on 100 patients, utilizing information available on admission and again after their evaluation is complete.  This program will then be incorporated in a more comprehensive system, designed to aid the physician in the diagnosis and management of patients at risk for impending stroke in general.  This comprehensive system will combine a hypothesize-and-test inference mechanism modeled on the clinician's diagnostic reasoning for suggesting diagnoses, with a rule-based method for suggesting plans for patient management.  This system will then be tested utilizing records from the Stroke Data Bank.  The second phase of the proposed research will focus on the development and testing of a computer program for neurologic localization.  Unlike previous programs this will have a well grounded theoretical basis in set cover theory, will employ sophisticated spatial inference and cause-effect reasoning and be capable of answer justification.  Once developed and tested, this program will be incorporated into CMD systems for neurologic diagnosis and management.  The completion of a system with these capabilities will represent an advance in the field of artificial intelligence as well as be of benefit to practicing clinicians and in the education of future physicians.

"COMPUTER AIDED DIAGNOSIS OF LYMPH NODE DISEASES We seek support to (1) investigate fundamental issues in applications of artificial intelligence to medicine within the context of lymph node pathology and (2) construct a useful diagnostic system for the hematopathology field.  The complexity of hematopathology poses a rich set of challenges for artificial intelligence in medicine.  Our research addresses fundamental problems of knowledge representation, reasoning strategies, user modeling, explanation, and user acceptance.  Our goal is to build a useful decision system for pathologists.  Such a working system would be extraordinarily useful for the lymph node pathology field.  Many studies have documented that there are major problems in the diagnosis and classification of malignant lymphomas and they are often confused with benign diseases.  This poses a major problem for the oncologist as accurate diagnosis is crucial for appropriate treatment.  We have built a prototype experty system called PATHFINDER which makes diagnoses of lymph node pathology through a consideration of 50 malignant and 30 benign diseases and approximately 500 histopathologic findings.  The program uses the method of sequential diagnosis; it can generate differential diagnoses based on a small number of findings and can suggest other findings useful for narrowing the differential diagnosis.  Consensus meetings have already resulted in agreement on features and diseases to be used by the program. Our research plans are to further develop PATHFINDER so that it can become not only a regularly used diagnostic tool for users having different levels of training and experience, but also can serve as a powerful teaching system.  The proposed expert system will provide a unique integrated knowledge base for the benign diseases of lymph nodes.  AIDS, and lymphomas giving the practicing pathologist immediate access to accurate morphologic classification and diagnostic criteria, while at the same time providing guidance as to whether additional tests (immunologic, cytogenetic, cell-kinetic, and immunogenetic) are likely to be informative.  It is anticipated that a working diagnostic system could improve the reproducibility and reliability of lymphoma diagnosis, facilitate the standardization of diagnoses in clinical trials, and help ensure appropriate therapy at the community hospital level.  We plan to substantially increase the quantity and quality of knowledge through (1) the integration of independent knowledge bases from the four experts mentioned above, (2) the integration of laboratory, clinical, immunologic, cell kinetic, cytogenetic, and immunogenetic information, and (3) the restructuring of the knowledge base to include dependencies among features.  Furthermore, we will (4) facilitate the identification of morphologic features and standardize definitions of features and diseases by incorporating detailed textual and pictorial descriptions (using videodisk technology), (5) develop mapping schemes that will facilitate the understanding of the many classification systems for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and (6) implement methods for the detection of multiple discordant histologies, progression of disease over time, and atypical proliferation.  Also, we will implement and incorporate into the program (1) scoring methods when features are interdependent, (2) heuristics for high-level control of reasoning strategies, (3) heuristics which customize the bahavior of the program to the expertise of the user, (4) formal decision analysis techniques, and (5) methods for system explanation. Throughout the three year period, we will also monitor our progress through iterative testing of reasoning strategies and frequent validations of the program's knowledge.

The context and driving force for this research is the management of heart failure in the intensive care setting.  We will:  1) Develop a representational methodology capable of supporting the clinically relevant distinctions of patient state.  This representation will utilize the clinically significant qualitative parameter values and will include causal relationships, time dependencies and relations about change.  2) Build a qualitative physiological model of the cardiovascular system using this methodology to act as a store for evolving knowledge of patient state.  3) Explore and develop strategies for determining the appropriate parameter values in the model from input data, reasoning support methods and heuristics for carrying out the diagnostic reasoning with the model, and reasoning support methods and heuristics for carrying out the diagnostic reasoning with the model, and reasoning support methods and heuristics for finding possible therapies and determining their potential consequences. 4) Build around this core a program to assist the physician in exploring his or her understanding of the implications in an individual case.

"LONG-TERM PLASMA EXCHANGE IN FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEM The objective of this study is to determine in subjects heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) whether the very massive reduction in plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (approximately 120 mg/dl) which can be achieved using repetitive isovolumetric plasma exchange (RPE) coupled with hypocholesterolemic drug therapy can induce regression or prevent progression of atheromatous coronary artery disease.  The substantial decrease and improved long term control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol by RPE coupled with hypocholesterolemic drugs should amplify the preliminary evidence which has indicated that regression of early femoral atherosclerosis and nonprogression of advanced coronary lesions can be achieved by drug treatment alone in heterozygous FH.  We propose to undertake long-term (four years) RPE at two week intervals in fifteen heterozygous subjects with FH.  Pretreatment and within treatment coronary atheromatous lesions and ventricular function and perfusion will be assessed by serial quantitative, computerized coronary angiography, rest and exercise Thallium-201 perfusion studies, respectively.  The effectiveness of RPE will be judged not only by longitudinal studies of the plasma exchange group, but also in a randomized concurrent control group of subjects receiving only maximal drug therapy.  In addition, comparison will also be made against two groups of patients (historical controls) selected by Dr. John Brensike from the type II coronary intervention study recently completed at the NIH.  These patients will be selected using the same criteria for entry into this study and will have been treated with diet alone or diet plus cholestyramine.  The subjects will have undergone cardiac catheterization at the start of the study, at two years after entry, and at five years after entry.  In effect, therefore, the results of repeat coronary angiography in fifteen patients who undergo massive reductions in plasma cholesterol by REP plus maximal drug therapy will be compared to three control groups: a randomized concurrently treated group (diet plus maximal drug therapy), and two historical NIH concurrently treated groups (one with dietary treatment only, and a group on diet plus cholestyramine).

This program can be coupled to the tertiary packing algorithms of Cohen et.al. to produce protein-like structures.  In the best case with proteins that have been studied crystallographically, discrepancies of ca. 4 angstroms are observed.  Methods of reducing these errors are evaluated. Second, we seek a detailed model for the motions of ligands in proteins. Conventional molecular dynamics and trajectory calculations will be compared to methods that reveal packing defects and channels in proteins in a direct way.

Ultrasound computer-assisted transmission tomography will be utilized to obtain quantitative images of acoustic speed, acoustic attenuation, acoustic absorption and scatter and reflection where appropriate.  Both analytic and iterative methods of correcting aberrations in the images caused by inhomogeneous refractive index will be investigated.  Compound B-scan images will also be obtained in the same coronal planes.

Patients scheduled for surgical biopsy will be scanned and the resulting images compared to the histology results from biopsy and/or surgical mastectomy.  Comparisons between surgical specimens and acoustic images will be made using methods of automated computer-assisted pattern classification and recognition combined with histological methods of tissue preparation specifically designed to aid in comparing ultrasound images of the coronal plane of the intact breast with similar planes through the excised breast.

"NOVEL PROBES FOR EFFICIENT GENETIC DISEASE DIAGNOSIS Current techniques for the diagnosis of genetic disease are limited by an inability to detect the majority of mutations and polymorphisms in DNA. DNA molecules which differ by one or a few base pairs can most efficiently be distinguished currently by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis due to sequence specific differences in melting properties of the DNA. However, base changes can be detected only in domains of the molecule which melt first in these gels.  We propose to improve this technique so that base pair changes can be detected in all domains of a DNA molecule.  We will modify DNA probes in ways that will significantly alter the melting behavior of DNA hybrids, so that new regions of the DNA molecule will be included in the first melting domain.  In addition, we will use experimental data to generate computer models to predict melting behavior of modified DNA molecules.  These computer programs can then be used to design optimal probes for detecting sequence changes in any DNA molecule. This technology should be broad enough for application to any gene of interest, and could lead to the commercial development of diagnostic tests for a number of genetic diseases.

"PERCEIVING STRUCTURE IN EVENTS The aim of this project is to identify the means by which human observers organize moving structures and perceive them as dynamic wholes.  The particular moving structures used will be computer-generated displays of dots that, in their movement, mimic human walkers, rolling wheels, and other everyday events.  Previous research has shown that these displays yield robust percepts, despite their relative impoverishment of seen elements.  And the dearth of elements involved allows simple and concise mathematical description.  This project will proceed on three fronts.  The first will study perceptual organization with a particular focus on how much time is needed to organize a dynamic stimulus.  Brief displays of systems of dots will be displayed for varying amounts of time in order to assess the durations necessary for the identification of familiar movements of near-familiar objects.  The second will study perceptual organization with a focus on the effectiveness of various kinds of camouflage in inhibiting identification of common objects in motion.  Static and dynamic camouflages of several types will be employed, with a particular emphasis on the movement parameters of a dynamic camouflage that are most effective in interfering with identification.  The third will study perception organization with a focus on the information available about movement in iconic memory.  Previous research has shown that such information is available, and the nature of the coded form of that information will be assessed.  The idea is that if information about many parameters of movement is available as early as the icon, then the perceiver is clearly attuned to that information and appears not to need to elaborate it in a computational fashion.  The disciplines involved in this study are, primarily, psychology and visual perception, and, secondarily, artificial intelligence and computer simulation.  The health relatedness of this project is to be measured in terms of understanding the normal function of the human visual/perceptual system, both in situations of natural complexity and in reduced complexity such as when viewing elements on radar screens, and when watching for pedestrians crossing the streets at night.

"STEPPED-CARE COLLEAGUE:  AUTOMATED THERAPY REVIEW IN HYP Clinical decision support systems and medical information systems are both of great interest in medical informatics.  Ideally these two types of systems should be closely linked to provide maximum educational and clinical utility.  Usually medical informatics development emphasizes one type of system to the exclusion of the other.  The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a generic, linked system in which medical knowledge represented in the decision support module is applied in the clinical setting in the context of an existing information system.  The major advantages are practical:  the data required by the decision support system is already available; no special data collection or entry is needed.  The advice given by the decision support system is presented in clinical ""real-time"" to optimize its effect.  The second objective is to maximally exploit non-artificial intelligence in medicine (AIM) systems for representing medical knowledge and decision making processes when appropriate.  This is cost effective and, if sufficiently robust, may be adequate for many types of medical decision problems.  In this proposal we plan to develop general methods and apply them to a single clinical setting:  hypertension care.  The specific work will test the hypothesis that an automated therapeutic management review system may be created, using a non-AIM rule-based structure coupled with a system designed to frequently gather pertinent clinical information, to provide sophisticated analysis of current medical management for providers.  The system will survey current clinical data and, following a stepped care approach to the treatment of hypertension, advise providers as to when they should increase therapy, modify therapy, or reduce therapy in appropriate circumstances.  The prototype system will be studied in a general medicine practice. Testing will involve the examination of its performance in terms of reliability and validity, its psychological impact on providers and their perception of benefit and satisfaction, and its cost and impact on stepped care therapy.

"LANGUAGE LEARNABILITY AND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT This project has three aims.  The first is development, refinement, and testing of an explicit theory of language acquisition in children.  The theory, building on earlier work, will if successful account for the development of language from the start of syntax learning through the acquisition of complex grammatical structures; it will be consistent with linguistic theory and the important facts of language development in children; it will deal with exotic languages as well as English; and it will learn despite noisy, complex, misinterpreted, or nonstandard inputs. A computer simulation of the theory, using ""constraint satisfaction"" algorithms from artificial intelligence research, will test its adequacy and claims about the kinds of information necessary and sufficient for language acquisition to work.  The second aim is to search computerized databases of children's speech for ""possible but nonoccurring errors"", such as violations of subjacency or dative movement.  These searchers will be used to test claims about what sorts of linguistic constraints children are born with.  The third part of the project is an experimental investigation of certain of children's rule-learning mechanisms and their cognitive correlates.  Children will be taught novel words in isolation to see if they use the semantics of a word to guess its syntactic privileges (e.g. action word = verb; agent = subject).  Interactions between conceptual structure and language development will be examined by studies examining the acquisition of constraints on the causative construction, children's use of a ""thematic"" or spatial schema to conceptualize nonspatial events such as changes of state, and their acquisition of spatial and nonspatial prepositions.  Results of the project could yield new methods of assessing children's ability to produce specific grammatical constructions, insight into the language learning mechanisms that can be used in remediation programs for language-disabled individuals, specific techniques to teach new words and constructions to children, and quantitative measures of language development.

"AUTOMATION OF DNA SEQUENCE DATA ENTRY DNA sequence determination has become a standard method for the characterization of newly isolated genes.  Recent advances in the technology for the determination of DNA sequences have allowed large amounts of data to accumulate rapidly.  However, methods for transferring that data into the computer, where it is to be analysed, are still far from ideal, in that they require considerable manual interention.  We propose to develop a highly automated system that will greatly increase the accuracy and the speed with which sequence data can be collected and analysed.  The method requires first producing a digital image of the sequencing radioautogram.  Algorithms will then be devised that are able to convert that ditigized data into a DNA sequence.  A key feature of the software for this interpretative step is that it will operate according to a set of heuristic procedures that are clearly defined and which can easily be modified and extended.  When these rules fail to provide an unambiguous interpretion then operator assistance will be requested to make a final decision.  An important consequence of the strategy is that the primary data upon which the DNA sequence depends will be available in machine-readable form.  Appropriate software will be developed to manage this primary data and to assist in the resolution of discrepancies that may arise during the course of a sequencing project.  The software tools that will be developed during the course of this project would have additional applications for the interpretation of all kinds of biological data that derive from gel electrophoretic techniques.

"STRUCTURED ANALYSIS OF THE RETINA We propose to develop computer-aided automated analysis of features in ocular fundus images and fluorescein angiograms and further to generate an expert system for rule-based image interpretation and diagnosis.  The use of artificial intelligence in conjunction with image analysis is a sophisticated and innovative approach new to ophthalmology.  Image processing and pattern-recognition techniques will be used to automatically extract features such as hemorrhages, exudates, scars, blood vessels, the optic disk, etc., from digital fundus images by analyzing attributes such as size, shape, color, texture, edge characteristics, fluorescein hyperfluorescence etc., which describe these features.  The automated extraction of fundus features will be performed by a software package called STARE (STructured Analysis of the REtina), which will produce a coded structured description of an image of the ocular fundus.  Features will be assembled into patterns of potential diagnostic significance.  For computer-aided diagnosis, patterns of automatically extracted features will be combined with non-image information provided by the physician expert through application of pre-defined decision rules.  The knowledge and training that enables the physician to appreciate the significance of particular patterns and ask appropriate questions will be encoded in rules designed as IF-THEN-ELSE decision structures.  We will use an existing expert rule-based bystem called ERS (Embedded Rule-based System), which has interactive facilities, to receive information from the physician and report findings.  We will develop STARE for the automated analysis of fundus images through objective measurements of pixels with pixel algorithms such as gradient operators, spectral classifiers, and edge detectors; grouping of pixels with application of pattern-recognition algorithms such as statistical classifiers and segmenters; interpretation of local areas extracted by pixel algorithms using object algorithms for measurement of attributes such as color and edge sharpness; and identification of features such as the disk or exudates with higher level statistical classifiers and rule-based decision making.  Following development of image-coding and database software, we will start with one or two example goal nodes (diagnoses) and will produce rules with both forward chaining and backward chaining, edit and modify the rules with reality testing on our large library of fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms to detect and correct deficiencies in STARE algorithms and ERS rules, and expand the system to cover more diagnoses and improve performance.

"VISUOMOTOR COORDINATION:  NEURAL NETWORKS AND SCHEMAS Our approach to analyzing mechanisms of visuomotor coordination is two-fold:  ""top-down"", to offer a coordinated control program of interacting schemas (concurrently active programs suitably structured for action-perception systems) to model behavior noted by neuroethologists; and ""bottom-up"", to provide detailed models of neural networks which are consistent with known anatomy and physiology, but which involve additional assumptions, amenable to experimental test, to yield a network capable of exhibiting appropriate behavior.  Where possible, we implement a family of models, rather than a single model, to facilitate computer experiments and animal experiments which may discriminate between alternative mechanisms. Specifically, we plan to conduct studies of the following subtopics:  (1) Modelling tectum-pretectum interactions subserving pattern-recognition in anurans; (2) Detailed neural modelling of retina; (3) Modelling patterns of behavior in frog and toad while developing a theory of motor schemas and their coordination for orientation, sidestepping, snapping, etc.; and (4) Developing mathematical and computer methodology for exploring a model-family to determine which subset of models approximates satisfaction of a given set of constraints.  The work will make modelling tools available for the analysis of large brain systems.  Our research plan has build into it structures which ensure that these tools are accessible to neurophysiologists, neuroanatomists and neuroethologists, while also facilitating a full exchange of ideas with the computer science community (artificial intelligence, simulation methodology, interactive computer graphics, etc.).

"ULTRASOUND HYPERTHERMIA SYSTEM FOR CANCER THERAPY The goal of this program is to design, develop, and evaluate a state-of-the-art system for ultrasonically inducing local hyperthermia in humans for use in cancer therapy.  The program is composed to several interconnected subgoals which are:  1) To continue development of existing computer programs used for transducer design and beam pattern evaluation, thermal exposure calculations and resulting temperature distributions.  2) To design and evaluate ultrasound transducers that are optimised for inducing hyperthermia.  3) Install transducers with appropriate power supplies and controllers in a modified diagnostic ultrasound scanner.  The central unit is a commercial OCTOSON digital ultrasound imaging system.  We will add a number of additional heating transducers to the gantry in out-rigger fashion.  Each transducer will be separately driven by its own power amplifier and driver.  The drivers will be driven by a micro-processor based control unit.  Temperatures at varius important sites within the patient will be measured with thermocouples or other devices and made available to the operator and to the control unit by means of a data acquisition system.  4) Design and install a hardware and software link between temperature monitoring devices on subjects and the microprocessor controllers within the imager for the purpose of automating the delivery of thermal dose.  5) Evaluate the system with phantoms.  6) Evaluate the system with animals.  The purpose of the animal studies will be two-fold: a) determine whether focused ultrasound can be effectively delivered to deep seated abdominal masses without excessive heating of adjacent critical normal organs.  b) Determine initial antitumor effects and normal tissue toxicities resulting from such treatment in pet animals with spontaneous tumors, i.e. Phase I/II Preclinical Trials.  The animal portion of this project has been planned to solve the technical problems of safely and effectively heating deep seated abdominal tumors with focused ultrasound. 7) Evaluate the system with humans.  a) Evaluate ability of the proposed system to achieve prescribed thermal distributions in human tumors, b) evaluate toxicity associated with the proposed ultrasound hyperthermia technique, c) compare the thermal distributions and temperature patterns achieved with the proposed device to those achieved with other hyperthermia devices, d) evaluate the imaging capability of the device, e) evaluate tumor response rates and duration of response rates and duration of response.

"NUTRIENT ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS & GASTRIC MUCOSAL INJURY We propose to investigate the role of nutrient essential fatty acids (EFA)-namely arachidonic and linoleic in the prevention and healing of gastric mucosal injury in the rat produced by ethanol, aspirin and taurocholic acid.  We will determine whether:  1) acute and/or chronic administration of EFA may a) prevent or reduce gastric mucosal damage or b) speed up healing of pre-existing injury; 2) diet deficient in EFA predisposes to gastric mucosal injury, increases its extent or delays healing, and the mechanism(s) responsible for these effects.  The rationale for these studies is that EFA are natural DIETARY precursors of prostaglandins which have been shown to protect the gastric mucosa against acute injury produced by damaging factors and to accelerate healing of gastroduodenal ulcers in man.  Studies will be performed on male Sprague Dawley rats receiving:  (1) single dose of EFA as a pretreatment or as a posttreatment of mucosal injury, (2) diet deficient in EFA for 10 weeks, (3) diet rich in EFA for 10 weeks, (4) diet sufficient in EFA (controls). Gastric mucosal injury will be produced by acute intragastric administration of absolute ethanol, acidified aspirin or taurocholic acid. Gastric mucosal damage, its healing and mucosal protection will be assessed:  A) macroscopically by scoring and computerized image analysis B) histologically with morphometric quantitation of necrosis C) by determination of mucosal cell proliferation kinetics D) ultrastructurally with scanning and transmission electromicroscopy E) functionally by measurements of ionic fluxes, potential difference and intragastric pH, and F) biochemically by measurements of luminal loss of DNA, protein and blood and the concentration or prostaglandins in the gastric contents.  TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISM(S) OF EFA PROMOTED GASTRIC MUCOSAL PROTECTION WE PLAN TO STUDY:  (1) THE EFFECT OF DNA AND PROTEIN SYNTHESIS INHIBITORS AND OF MICROTUBULES AND MICROFILAMENTS DISRUPTIVE AGENTS ON EFA PROTECTION; (2) RESISTANCE OF RESTORED SURFACE EPITHELIUM TO SUBSEQUENT INJURY; (3) ACTION OF EFA ON ISOLATED GASTRIC MUCOSAL CELLS (SURFACE, PROLIFERATIVE ZONE) THEIR VIABILITY AND ABILITY TO GENERATE PROSTAGLANDINS.

"NUCLEIC ACID SEQUENCE ANALYSIS We have developed a method to clone synthetic DNAs with regions of random sequence.  We are using this technique to create millions of ribosome binding sites in an isogenic background.  The cloning vehicle contains the lacZ gene positioned to allow quantitation of initiation from each binding site and the f1 origin which allows rapid DNA sequencing.  From a large set of sequences for which we know the relative efficiencies of initiation we can build linear models of the E. coli ribosome binding site.  We will construct plasmids with regions that differ on the 5' and 3' sides from our original plasmid in order to study the more complex effects of mRNA structure and context on translational initiation.  We propose to extend this technique into a tool for the study of any binding site.  We are also studying sequence specific recognition of DNA by proteins.  We have adapted the Shannon measure of information to quantitate the information content of several recognition systems.  This has led to a prediction that the T7 late promoters have overlapping repressor sites, a prediction that we are now testing.  We have shown that the information content of sites for recognizer proteins is related to the sequence specific binding energies, and have devised a method to determine the quantitative sequence preferences of proteins through in vitro binding to random DNA.

"CUTANEOUS PATERN PERCEPTION The proposed research will investigate the perception of tactile patterns by human subjects.  The tactile patterns will be generated on arrays of stimulators that fit against the subject's fingertips.  Each array consists of 144 stimulators arranged in a matrix 6 columns by 24 rows.  Sets of patterns differing along such dimensions as location, intensity, number of line segments, and so forth will be generated and presented to subjects. Response measures will include identification, discrimination, reaction time, and pattern matching.  Three aspects of tactile pattern perception will be examined:  masking, interactions among multiple sites of stimulation, and the role of experience.  A temporal masking paradigm will be used to see how the perception of tactile patterns is interfered with by tactile maskers and how the nature of the interference changes with changes in the type of masker and in the temporal separation between target and masker.  In the studies of interaction among multiple sites, patterns will be presented to as many as three sites on the fingertips and palm.  This paradigm will be used to assess the role of attention in tactile information processing. The role of short-term experience will be examined by measuring changes in pattern perception as subjects learn to identify and discriminate tactile patterns.  The effect of long-term experience will be evaluated by comparing the performance of groups of subjects who differ in the amount and nature of their experience with complex tactile patterns.  One group will be Optacon users, blind individuals who can read by means of a tactile array.  The other groups will be blind individuals without Optacon experience and several groups of sighted subjects with varying amounts of tactile experience.  The proposed research will be concerned with drawing parallels between tactile processing and visual and auditory processing, with developing measures relevant to understanding the neural coding of tactile patterns, and with improving cutaneous communication systems for the blind, deaf, and deaf-blind.

"CONTEXT-BASED AUTOMATED DETECTION OF ABNORMAL EEG WAVES The proposed research will investigate the development of an ""intelligent"", multichannel (16 channels) automated (general purpose computer-based) system for the reliable detection of epileptogenic sharp waveforms (spikes and shart waves-STs) in the electroencephalogram (EEG).  The system will provide the time of occurrence of individual STs, their spatial location, along with values of pertinent electrographic characteristics (e.g. amplitude, duration) thereof.  Special attention will be given to the minimization of false alarms due to artifact and normal EEG activity.  Such a system will especially facilitate the rapid and reliable analysis of long-term EEG recordings from subjects with known or suspected epilepsy, thus contributing to their optimum therapeutic management as well as resulting in savings of time and money.  Extensive heuristics based on human pattern recognition, which involves contextbased analysis, will be utilized.  In this way, the system will incorporate the intelligence of an electroencephalographer (EEGer).  An Artificial Intelligence approach will be implemented, whereby EEG features quantifying candidate waveforms, as well as automated assessment of the subject's state of consciousness will be presented to an Expert System for eventual decision making.  The knowledge base of the Expert system will be developed in close cooperation with an experienced EEGer, so that the extensive contextbased heuristics utilized in the visual analysis process (e.g. spatio-temporal processing involving multichannel correlations) will be implemented.  Special emphasis will be given to programming into the detection system the ability to discriminate against ST-like artifactual activity in the EEG record (e.g. electrocardiographic and electromyographic interference) as well as against sharp but normal EEG activity (e.g. sleep spindles).  Extensive validation studies will be conducted utilizing EEG data from epileptic subjects, other patients, and normal controls.  An investigation will also take place of the possibility of implementing the detection system in a microprocessor-based version for portability and ease of operation.

"ALGORITHMS FOR ARRHYTHMIA IDENTIFICATION Our general goal is automatic identification of arrhythmias within implantable devices by computer-based signal processing of the intracardiac electrograms.  This goal appears to be realizable because:  1) the arrhythmias to be identified can be provoked in the catheter electrophysiology laboratory and the resulting electrograms can be recorded for detailed analysis; 2) modern signal processing techniques exist for characterizing the electrograms in the time domain and by spectral content; 3) computer algorithms can be designed to recognize these characteristic electrogram features in each arrhythmia; 4) implantable microcomputers are available in which the algorithms can be implemented.  An important premise of this proposal is that the hardware for electrical termination of arrhythmia is already availbale and thus there is a risk of new generations of devices being implanted for arrhythmia control before the underlying electrophysiologic concepts and pattern recognition rules for identifying the arrhythmia are developed and tested.  The signal processing algorithms and decision rules for automatic detection and discrimination will be implemented in real time in a computer program small enough to be part of an implanted anti-tachycardia or defibrillating device.  We will first examine and describe in both the time and frequency domains the characteristic features of electrograms recorded during provocative electrophysiologic study in animals and humans.  Then we will develop computer algorithms for signal processing of the electrograms and for arrhythmia pattern recognition.  Finally, we will test the stated hypotheses by conducting additional animal and human electrophysiology studies and determining the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithms. Our approach combines the engineering skill of computer-based signal analysis with the medical skill of diagnostic cardiac electrophysiology. It is our expectation that this approach will provide a sound scientific basis upon which development of specific hardware by pacemaker manufacturers can proceed.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION FOR ANALYSIS OF MOLECULAR SEQUENCES We propose to continue (A) the development of mathematical, statistical and computer methods for the analysis of DNA, RNA and protein sequences and (B) the application of these methods.  The comparison of two and more informational sequences is central to many problems in molecular biology. (1) Finding consenting patterns that define genetic control regions or that determine structure or function are important examples of sequence comparisons.  An algorithm already developed by my group will be developed further and applied to several new data sets, such as Pol II promoters and RNA splice signals.  Careful data analyses should suggest new modifications to the method.  New and nontrivial insights into promoter patterns, for example, could result from an unbiased, rigorous analysis with calculated significance levels.  (2) Secondary structure of 5S, 16S, and 23S rRNA has been inferred by the phylogenetic method.  Consensus and probability results will be developed to solve this problem in a rigorous way.  Again, new information about secondary structure could result.  (3) T1 catalogs are available for 16S rRNA from many organisms.  A careful analysis, based on pattern and significance of found patterns, will be made.  This will constitute a new and entirely unbiased study of divisions such as archaebacteria, eukaryotes, and eubacteria.  (4) Recent important results have been established for the exact (extreme value) distribution of long exact matches between random sequences.  These distributions are fundamental to pattern recognition in general and allow statistical assessment of found patterns.  The distributions will be extended to include results of long matching where mismatches and insertion/deletions are allowed.

"CANCER PROTEIN DATA BASE High resolution two dimensional electrophoresis allows a large fraction of the estimated 30,000 to 50,000 human proteins to be identified by map position and to be quantitated.  Normal and cancer cells have been mapped in orienting studies and many differences found.  To give meaning to these results, and to systematically exploit them, a large data base (the Cancer Protein Data Base) including all available and all obtainable data on each spot is required, with the data base directly linked to CRT map displays. The data base will include (for each protein) intracellular location, types of cells in which found, names, functions, disease correlations, biophysical data, literature citations, membership in coregulated sets, differentiational stage of occurrence, and chromosomal location of the coding gene.  The theses to be explored are that cells are highly integrated systems to be understood in terms of protein sets and the regulational circuits involving them, and that compositional changes in cancer cells are not random, but reflect alterations in normal regulational and differentiational functions.

"TAPERED LINEAR ARRAY FOR ULTRASOUND HYPERTHERMIA The overall goal of this project is to complete the development and to test a novel ultrasonic tapered linear phased array applicator for hyperthermia treatment.  Such an applicator will allow electronic steering of the focus along a desired path without the use of a mechanical scanning system and will remain fixed relative to the patient, making coupling easier.  The applicator will be computer controlled such that the scan path and/or intensity can be altered at any time during treatment to maintain a constatn uniform tumor temperature.  Such a system is expected to meet the requirements for controlled local hyperthermia treatment of deep-seated tumors.  Each element of the phased array applicator (64 in all) will be driven by a modular high-power multichannel RF generator similar to that used in the URI Therm-X, Inc. Sonotherm 1000 ultrasound hyperthermia system.  Initial testing of the applicator will consist of experimentally acquiring field plots and comparing them to the theoretically predicted plots.  Once satisfied that the experimental phased array applicator is generating fields as expected theoretically, and that these fields are such that they should be adequate for hyperthermia applications, tests on phantoms will be initiated.  Finally, the performance of the prototype applicator which electronically scans its focus will be compared to that of a mechanically scanned, fixed focus applicator for various scan patterns.

"MICROWAVE PHASED ARRAY FOR HYPERTHERMIA CANCER THERAPY The goal of this project is to develop a prototype microwave phased array applicator for local tumor hyperthermia therapy.  The therapeutic effectiveness of ionizing radiation therapy can be improved by the focused application of heat to the tumor.  The use of microwaves for the generation of local hyperthermia has been successfully applied in both animal and clinical studies.  However, current designs for microwave applicators heat only superficial tumors and must be mechanically moved in order to change the power distribution in the tumor and surrounding normal tissues.  The specific aims of the proposed Phase I study are designed to develop new techniques for producing local tumor hyperthermia using microwaves. Preliminary studies have resulted in a new design for a microwave phased array hyperthermia applicator.  The proposed Phase I studies will allow development of this existing design into a working prototype microwave hyperthermia applicator system.  This applicator system will consist of a microwave phased array applicator, a microwave power amplifier and distribution network, and a computer control system for the applicator. This new microwave phased array applicator system will have the capability of focusing microwave energy more effectively in tissue than presently available clinical devices and the location of the focus will be electronically rather than mechanically scanned in order to produce a uniform tumor temperature distribution without overheating surrounding normal tissues.

"SIMULATION OF MENTAL PROCESSES IN LIGHT OF THE BRAIN This project is aimed at the development of explicit computational models of perceptual and cognitive processes, relying on mechanism which are consistent with what is known about the physiology and anatomy of the brain.  Recent work simulating perceptual and cognitive processes indicates that this is a fertile path to follow, but to do this adequately I need to learn more about the brain and more about the simulation of the kinds of computational processes which seem consistent with what goes on in the brain.  The first two years of this award would be devoted primarily to obtaining this background, as well as to research applying what I would be learning to a process at the interface between perception and cognition--namely reading.  Before the start of the career development award I plan to obtain some basic background in neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and computer simulation techniques used in artificial intelligence.  I plan to spend the first year of the award at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Massachusetts Institue of Technology, studying recent advances in the understanding of parallel computation, and working on the development of a neurally plausible simulation model of the visual aspects of reading.  I plan to spend the second year at the Aphasia Research Center of Boston University at the Boston Veterans Administration Hospital, rounding out my background in the neurological basis of cognition and beginning research designed to use the effects of brain damage as a way of finding out about the nature of the underlying processing system. Specifically, I would study the disturbance of word processing ability that arises in deep dyslexia a type of reading disability resulting from damage in certain ageas of the brain.  During the summer of the second year I also plan to participated in an advanced neurophysiology course such as the one offered at Cold Springs Harbor, Long Island.  The remaining three years of the career development award would be dedicated to the continued exploration of simulation models of cognitive and perceptual processes constructed in the light of what I would learn during the first two years; and to the writing of a book designed to help establish the approach of developing neurally plausible simulation models as a central part of the study of perceptual and cognitive processes.
