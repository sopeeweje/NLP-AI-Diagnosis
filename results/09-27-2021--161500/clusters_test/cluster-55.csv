"Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data Sequencing technologies have become an essential tool to the study of human evolution, to the understanding of the genetic bases of diseases and to the clinical detection and treatment of genetic disorders. Computational algorithms are indispensible to the analysis of large-scale sequencing data and have received broad attention. However, developed several years ago, many mainstream software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and variant calling have gradually lagged behind the rapid development of sequencing technologies. They are unable to process the latest long reads or assembled contigs, and will be outpaced by upcoming technologies in terms of throughput. The development of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. This project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing a fast and accurate aligner that accelerates short-read alignment and can map megabase-long assemblies against large sequence collections of over 100 gigabases in size; (2) developing an integrated caller for small sequence variations that is faster to run, more sensitive to moderately longer insertions and more accessible to biologists without extended expertise in bioinformatics; (3) developing a generic variant filtering tool that uses a novel deep learning model to achieve human-level accuracy on identifying false positive calls; (4) developing a new de novo assembler that works with the latest nanopore reads of ~100 kilobases in length and may achieve good contiguity at low coverage. Upon completion, the proposed studies will dramatically reduce the computational cost of data processing in most research labs and commercial entities, and will enable the applications of long reads in genome assembly, in the study of structural variations and in cancer researches. Computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of high-throughput sequencing data produced for the detection, prevention and treatment of cancers and genetic disorders. The proposed studies aim to address new challenges arising from the latest sequencing data and to develop faster and more accurate solutions to existing applications. The success of this proposal is likely to unlock the full power of recent sequencing technologies in disease studies and will dramatically reduce the cost of data analyses.",Advanced computational methods in analyzing high-throughput sequencing data,10113656,R01HG010040,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Large-Scale Sequencing', 'Length', 'Mainstreaming', 'Maps', 'Medical Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Performance', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Production', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Seeds', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contig', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genome analysis', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'indexing', 'light weight', 'mammalian genome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'programs', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,397125
"Single Cell Transcriptomic and Genetic Diversity by Single Molecule Long Read Sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY Defining the features of cellular mixtures, where diverse cell types with distinct genomic characteristics are physically intermingled together, is a central problem in biology. During the past decade, single cell sequencing technologies have enabled a new era of high throughput and high resolution interrogation of cell type diversity, vastly expanding our understanding of the role that cell types play in development and disease. Yet, current studies in single cell genomics rely on short-read sequencing and thus suffer from limitations, including: (1) Most studies rely on short read counting which limits the study of alternative splicing. (2) Cell states are reflected by static snapshots, and while population dynamics can be deduced through trajectory and RNA velocity estimation, robust estimation of these parameters remains a major challenge. (3) Despite advances in single-cell DNA sequencing, there is yet no cost-effective way to simultaneously characterize both the genetic variants and transcriptome-level changes in a cell, which is crucial for diseases such as cancer. This proposal is motivated by technological breakthroughs in single-molecule sequencing (SMS) and the recent adaptation of SMS to the massively parallel sequencing of single cell transcriptomes in our lab. We propose to develop computational methods to harness the power of SMS in single cell transcriptomics. In particular, we have developed a new genomic approach which allows one to repeatedly interrogate complete transcripts from single cells using SMS long reads, rather than 3' or 5' counting with short reads. This technology allows experimental designs where specific transcript subsets and/or cellular subsets can be repeatedly targeted for deeper joint short and long read analysis over many iterations, which we will exploit to conduct analyses that were previously intractable.

"Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing PROJECT SUMMARY  Genome editing is revolutionizing biomedicine and biotechnology by enabling the precise modification of genomic DNA in living cells. While various genome-editing tools have been developed over the past decade, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as a particularly versatile and efficient technology for editing DNA. Nonetheless, limitations derived from its reliance on DNA double strand breaks (DSB), which can lead to unpredictable editing outcomes and even chromosomal translocations, could limit its applications.  Base editors (BEs) and prime editors (PEs) are two novel classes of genome-editing tools capable of introducing precise single-base conversion in DNA without the requirement of a DSB. PEs, in particular, provide greater flexibility than BEs, owing to their ability to introduce any type of base conversion and even programable small insertions and deletions. This expanded set of capabilities compared to other technologies makes PEs a particularly promising platform for applications in biomedicine; however, the large size of PEs precludes their in vivo delivery by AAV, a promising and effective gene delivery vehicle that is currently under evaluation in multiple clinical trials.  To overcome these obstacles, we have created a split-PE platform that is compatible with AAV delivery and have demonstrated the functionality of this approach in cultured cells. Despite this progress, there still remain several critical challenges, which we here propose to overcome in order to optimize this technology for effective and specific in vivo prime editing.  To accomplish this objective, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with collective expertise in genome editing (Dr. Perez-Pinera), AAV gene delivery (Dr. Gaj) and computational biology (Dr. Song). Our collaborative efforts will yield an integrated and comprehensive PE toolset that will blend strategies for target identification and editing optimization, with methods for reducing off-target effects and immune responses, thus priming this technology for future in vivo applications.  Given that the flexibility of PEs has significantly expanded the number of actionable target sites that can be genetically modified, we anticipate that the integrated technologies we develop will have large, direct and long- lasting impact in biomedicine by enabling not only novel gene therapies, but also basic research. In particular, our technology will provide investigators with biological tools that are uniquely capable of introducing mutations within post-mitotic cells in vivo, which could be used to dissect functional elements or even determine the role of pathogenic mutations in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. The technologies created by this application will thus broadly impact biotechnology and biomedicine. NARRATIVE Genome editing technologies provide novel opportunities to advance basic research and treat human diseases but approaches that use active nucleases to edit DNA can induce undesired and deleterious effects in the genome, which can reduce their therapeutic potential. Prime editors are a recently emerged gene-editing variant capable of introducing precise modifications to DNA, with minimal damage to the genome. This proposal is focused on creating an integrative prime editing toolkit that will provide investigators with technologies that will enable their use in vivo, improve their specificity and streamline their design and implementation, thereby advancing the applications of this methodology in biotechnology and biomedicine.",Development of Technologies for Efficient In Vivo Prime Editing,10184207,R01GM141296,"['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biotechnology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Carrying Capacities', 'Cells', 'Chromosomal translocation', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Cells', 'DNA', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Future', 'GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gs', 'Gene Delivery', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic approach', 'Immune response', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitotic', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Nonsense Mutation', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Peptide Signal Sequences', 'Poly A', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Site', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Splicing', 'Variant', 'adeno-associated viral vector', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'cell type', 'computational suite', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'gene therapy', 'genome editing', 'human disease', 'immunogenic', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'intein', 'miniaturize', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'particle', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'promoter', 'reconstitution', 'response', 'success', 'technology development', 'technology research and development', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,535871
"Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis Despite major advances in prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), it remains a major cause of deaths worldwide. As ASCVD is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and impact on this unmet residual risk. One such human polymorphism in the ID3 gene (rs11574) was associated with ASCVD in 3 distinct human cohorts. Notably, this SNP significantly attenuates ID3 function and studies in pre-clinical models confirm a critical role for ID3 in atheroprotection. We have previously shown that loss of ID3 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and promotes VSMC expression of inflammatory factors, processes linked to increase atherosclerosis. In collaboration with Dr. Gary Owens, we have generated a mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and VSMC-specific deletion of ID3 to study ID3-dependent VSMC specific changes during the course of lesion development in the context of the whole animal. We have developed a comprehensive CyTOF panel to identify and quantitate key cellular and intracellular changes in VSMC and other lesional cells in the aorta during the course of atherosclerosis development in these mice. To translate murine findings to humans, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering to knock out ID3 and produce the full allelic series of rs11574 in human cells and validated a reproducible system for differentiation of human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to VSMC. We will quantify the changes in VSMC phenotype in iPSC-derived VSMC with the full allelic series of rs11574. To further translate murine findings to humans, intravascular ultrasound virtual histology (IVUS-VH) will be measured in human coronary arteries and analyzed with cutting edge image analysis techniques in collaboration with Dr. Milan Sonka at the University of Iowa. As such, our group is uniquely poised to dissect the role of this ASCVD-associated SNP and translate findings to humans. We hypothesize: that loss of ID3 in VSMCs will inhibit VSMC growth and promote a phenotype that exacerbates vessel wall inflammation and atherosclerosis lesion development; that human ID3 encoded by the risk allele aggravates these atherogenic VSMC functions; and that human subjects with the risk allele have larger coronary plaques with increased fatty deposits, necrotic cores and calcification compared to subjects homozygous for the common allele. As atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a heritable and polygenic disorder, identification of ASCVD-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in humans and elucidation of their effect on ASCVD biology is needed to fully understand and further impact on ASCVD morbidity and mortality. Human ID3 gene polymorphism at rs11574 is associated with ASCVD in three unique human cohorts. Preliminary data supports a key role for ID3 in vascular smooth muscle cell biology linked to ASCVD. In the current proposal, we will utilize a novel mouse model with VSMC lineage tracing and specific deletion of ID3 to elucidate the role of ID3 in promoting atherogenic VSMCs. We will then utilize CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived VSMCs to identify the VSMC processes altered by the ID3 gene mutation linked to CVD. Lastly, we will determine if this ID3 gene mutation, alone or in combination with other gene mutations are associated with the amount and type of atherosclerotic plaque in human coronary arteries as measured by intravascular ultrasound virtual histology. Results have the potential to lead to novel targeted therapy for atherosclerosis.",Id3 and VSMC in Murine and Human Atherosclerosis,10210435,R01HL148109,"['Alanine', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Aorta', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Attenuated', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Heart', 'Heritability', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immune', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Iowa', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Null Lymphocytes', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Threonine', 'Translating', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Vascular Smooth Muscle', 'calcification', 'cell growth', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcium', 'coronary plaque', 'dimer', 'genome editing', 'human subject', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oxidized low density lipoprotein', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation', 'virtual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,671017
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults.

"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10304760,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2021,52000
"Scalable detection and interpretation of structural variation in human genomes PROJECT SUMMARY Structural variation (SV), is a diverse class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications, as well as balanced rearrangements, such as inversions and reciprocal translocations. A typical human genome harbors >4,000 SVs larger than 300bp and their large size increases the potential to delete or duplicate genes, disrupt chromatin structure, and alter expression. Despite their prevalence and potential for phenotypic consequence, SVs remain notoriously difficult to detect and genotype with high accuracy. Much of this difficulty is driven by the fact DNA sequence alignment “signals” indicating SVs are far more complex than for single-nucleotide and insertion deletion variants. Unlike SNP alignments that vary only in allele state, alignments supporting SVs vary in state (supports an alternate structure or not) alignment location, and type. Consequently, the accuracy of SV discovery is much lower than that of SNPs and INDELs. Furthermore, SV pipelines scale poorly and are difficult to run. These challenges are a barrier for single genome analysis and studies of families must invest substantial effort into eliminating a sea of false positives. These problems become exponentially more acute for large-scale sequencing efforts such as TOPmed, the Centers for Common Disease Genetics, and the All of Us program. Software efficiency is key to scalability for such projects. However, of equal importance is comprehensive, accurate discovery.  Building upon more than a decade of software development experience and analyzing SV in diverse disease contexts, we have invested significant effort into understanding the causes of the insufficient accuracy for SV discovery. These efforts, together with our research and development experience in this area, give us unique insight into improving the accuracy and scalability of SV discovery. Our goal is to narrow the accuracy gap between SNP/INDEL variation and structural variation discovery. These developments will empower studies of human genomes in diverse contexts and will therefore have broad impact. Our goals are to: 1. Develop a deep learning model to correct systematic variation in sequence depth. This new machine  learning model will correct systematic biases in DNA sequence depth and dramatically improve the  discovery of deletions and duplications. 2. Improve the speed, scalability, and accuracy of SV detection and genotyping. Using new algorithms,  we will bring the accuracy of SV detection much closer to that of SNP and INDEL discovery and allow  accurate SV discovery to be deployed at scale. 3. Create a map of genomic constraint for SV from population-scale genome analysis. We will deploy  our new methods to detect and genotype structural variation among tens of thousands of human genomes.  The resulting SV map will empower the creation of a model of genomic constraint for SV and enable new  software to predict deleterious SVs, especially in the noncoding genome. PROJECT NARRATIVE Single-nucleotide DNA changes paint an incomplete picture of a human’s genome. A more complete picture must include a genome's structural variation (SV), an important class of genome variation that includes copy number variants (CNVs) such as deletions and duplications. However, existing methods have poor accuracy. As the genetics community transitions to large-scale genome sequencing studies, there is an acute need for improved SV discovery methods.
