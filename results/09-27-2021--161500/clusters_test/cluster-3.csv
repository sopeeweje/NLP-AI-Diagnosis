"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10218158,R01DK125414,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Promotion Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Theory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cancer risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'control theory', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'mHealth', 'personalized medicine', 'post intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'relapse risk', 'theories', 'treatment duration', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,510240
"Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury Abstract Care partners of persons with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often required to assume a caregiver role, bearing primary responsibility for assisting the person with TBI in physical, mental, financial, and leisure activities. As a result of these new caregiving responsibilities, it is common for these care partners to report problems with physical, mental, and social health, as well as compromised health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Given that care partners’ well-being and functioning affects both their own personal health outcomes, as well as the functional and rehabilitation outcomes of the person with TBI, there is a critical need to develop novel health management interventions to ensure better health outcomes for both members of the TBI care partnership dyad. Therefore, our long-term goal is to improve the health and well-being of these care partners, as well as their ability to provide care to their loved one. Thus, the proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI), or personalized self-management intervention that uses objective mobile sensor data feedback to improve physical activity, sleep, and HRQOL in 240 care partners of persons with TBI. Our primary objectives are to: 1) assess the efficacy of this novel personalized self-management intervention (i.e., JITAI) for preventing the development of adverse symptoms (e.g., mobility, sleep, poor HRQOL); and 2) use data collected from wearables (i.e., the Fitbit Charge®) and real-time assessments of HRQOL to identify care partners with the greatest risk for negative physical and mental HRQOL outcomes, as well as the timing for when they are at greatest risk. We expect care partners that are randomized to receive the JITAI will demonstrate improvements in HRQOL, physical activity and sleep relative to controls. We also hypothesize is that objective, data-derived mobile phenotypes can predict risk for adverse caregiver HRQOL. The scientific premise for the proposed research is based on our multidisciplinary team with expertise in caregiver research, evaluation of HRQOL using patient-reported outcomes, clinical trials implementation, expertise in real time assessment of HRQOL, as well as the statistical expertise in high- dimensional statistics and machine learning. Furthermore, the innovation is grounded in the examination of a real-time, real-world, personalized and scalable JITAI designed to improve HRQOL in care partners. Ultimately, this study will allow us to identify care partners at the greatest risk for negative physical and mental health outcomes, and will provide important efficacy data to support the clinical utility of a low cost, low burden self-management intervention to improve HRQOL for care partners of persons with TBI. Narrative Care partners of persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are often faced with considerable physical and emotional stress resulting from their caregiver role; not surprisingly, this stress is associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes for both the care partner and the person for whom they provide care. Given this, interventions focused on improving the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these care partners will likely have positive downstream effects for the care recipient. The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a personalized self-management intervention designed to promote care partner self-care; this intervention uses physical activity and sleep data collected using a Fitbit® and real-time self-reports of HRQOL collected via a mobile phone app, to provide care partners with personalized feedback via app alert four times per week.",Improving Outcomes for Care Partners of Persons with Traumatic Brain Injury,10110031,R01NR013658,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Beds', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregiver research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Emotional Stress', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Feedback', 'Financial Activity', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Priorities', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Leisure Activities', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Nursing Research', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Reporting', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Care', 'Self Management', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'care recipients', 'care systems', 'caregiver strain', 'caregiving', 'clinical trial implementation', 'control trial', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy evaluation', 'fitbit', 'functional outcomes', 'group intervention', 'health assessment', 'health management', 'health related quality of life', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loved ones', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'poor sleep', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'sensor', 'sleep health', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tv watching']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,592501
"Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT One in 5 U.S. adults are thought to be living with a disability/impairment, a complex and multifaceted condition affecting movement patterns with related medical care costs exceeding $300 billion annually. Precise and accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in individuals with disabiliy/ impairment is essential to accurately measure PA/SB prevalence rates and effectiveness of behavioral based PA/SB interventions, and to fully elucidate PA/SB dose-response health relationships. Scientific progress has been made in this area with advanced analytics and data processing techniques applied to wearable accelerometers from laboratory calibration studies. There is a scientific need to extend calibration studies from fixed-duration laboratory simulated activities of daily living to free-living calibrations with natural observation and accelerometer algorithm training and validation. The aims of this proposal fill this essential scientific knowledge gap. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate and refine machine-learned algorithms to predict energy cost and activity type during a 24-hr respiratory calorimeter stay; 2) To validate machine-learned accelerometer algorithms with field-derived, video-recorded direct observation; and 3) To validate machine-learned algorithms using the doubly labeled water technique. Our highly qualified research team will address the above aims by using brief translatable functional tests to cluster movement-impaired populations into groups of healthy, upper-body impairment, lower-body impairment, and upper- and lower-body impairment. Best practice free- living calibration protocols will then be used to train, refine, and evaluate functional clustered-specific accelerometer algorithms for predicting activity energy cost, activity type, activity transitions, and activity domain. The results of these proposed studies will for the first time provide an innovative and translatable approach to categorize and assess free-living PA/SB in persons with disability and movement impairment.  NARRATIVE The accurate assessment of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) in populations with disability/functional impairment is essential for PA/SB surveillance, for determining effectiveness of behaviorally based PA/SB interventions, and for further elucidating dose-response relationships between PA/SB and health. The overall aim of this application is to extensively validate wearable accelerometers using advanced analytics and data processing in free-living naturalistic settings across categories of functional movement impairment, thus providing a convenient and translatable method to assess PA in diverse populations.",Calibrating free-living physical activity characteristics across functionally-limited populations using machine-learned accelerometer approaches,10126727,R01CA215318,"['Accelerometer', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Ankle', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biomechanics', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exercise', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Grouping', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Physical assessment', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'disability', 'doubly-labeled water', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence based guidelines', 'functional disability', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'motor impairment', 'population movement', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard measure', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R01,2021,475626
"PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site Project Summary Physical activity (PA) prevents or ameliorates a large number of diseases, and inactivity is the 4th leading global mortality risk factor. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the diverse benefits of PA are not well understood. The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is being formed to advance knowledge in this area. We propose to establish PAGES, a Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site as an integral component of the MoTrPAC. PAGES will conduct comprehensive analyses of the rat and human PA intervention MoTrPAC samples, contribute these data to public databases, help identify candidate molecular transducers of PA and elucidate new PA response mechanisms, and help develop predictive models of the individual response to PA. PAGES assay sites at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York Genome Center and Broad Institute provide the infrastructure, expertise and experience to support this large scale, comprehensive analysis of molecular changes associated with PA. PAGES aims are to 1. Work with the MoTrPAC Steering Committee in Year 1 to finalize plans and protocols; 2. Perform assays and analyses to help Identify candidate molecular transducers of the response to PA in rat models and the pathways responsible for model differences, including high-depth RNA-seq and Whole Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS), supplemented by additional assay types such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq based on initial results; 3. Perform comprehensive assays and analyses of the human MoTrPAC clinical study tissue samples, including RNA-seq, WGBS, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and whole genome sequencing. 4. Collaborate with the MoTrPAC to analyze data from PAGES and other MoTrPAC analysis sites to identify candidate PA transducers and molecular mechanisms, and to develop predictive models of PA capacity and response to training. The success of PAGES and the MoTrPAC program will transform insight into the molecular networks that transduce PA into health, create an unparalleled comprehensive public PA data resource, and can provide the foundation for profound advances in the prevention and treatment of many major human diseases. Project Narrative While physical activity prevents or improves a large number of diseases, the chemical changes that occur in the body and lead to better health are not well known. As a part of a consortium of physical activity research programs working together, we will use cutting-edge approaches to comprehensively study the changes in genes and gene products caused by physical activity. This study has the potential to lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of many diseases.","PAGES: Physical Activity Genomics, Epigenomics/transcriptomics Site",10083209,U24DK112331,"['ATAC-seq', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'New York', 'Ontology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'epigenomics', 'exercise intervention', 'experience', 'fitness', 'gene product', 'genome sequencing', 'high throughput analysis', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual response', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'methylome', 'mortality risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sedentary', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'web page', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U24,2021,3913893
"Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance SUMMARY – Parent U01  Emerging adulthood (ages 18-29 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of cancer and other chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. Traditional health behavior theories provide limited guidance regarding factors underlying behavior maintenance; therefore, to ad- dress this gap, our work suggests that dual-process models of decision-making and behavior can shed light on differences in the mechanisms underlying adoption versus maintenance. Reflective processes (e.g., efficacy, self-control) may be activated to a greater extent during behavior adoption. In contrast, reactive processes (e.g., contextual cues, automaticity) may play a greater role in behavior maintenance. However, re- active processes are difficult to measure because they can unfold on a micro-timescale (i.e., change across minutes or hours). To solve this problem, we propose to use real-time mobile technologies to collect inten- sive longitudinal data examining differences in the micro-temporal processes underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, low sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration. We will conduct intermittent self-report (i.e., ecological momentary assessment) of reflective variables; and continuous, sensor- based passive monitoring of reactive variables (e.g., location) and behaviors (i.e., physical activity, sedentary time, sleep) using smartwatches and smartphones. Data will be used to predict within-subject variation (within- days, between-days) in the likelihood of behavior “episodes” (e.g., ≥10 min of physical activity) and “lapses” (i.e., failure to achieve recommended levels ≥7 days). The specific aims are to (1) idiographically use machine learn- ing to identify person-specific combinations of time-varying reflective and reactive factors that predict behavior episodes and lapse; and (2) nomothetically determine whether there are group-level patterns of time-varying predictors, and whether those patterns predict successful behavior maintenance outcomes. The data and meth- ods will contribute to the U01/U24 Intensive Longitudinal Health Behavior Network’s collective goal to build more predictive health behavior theories that specify targets for personalized interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE - Parent U01 Weight gain increases dramatically emerging adulthood, increasing risk of cancer and chronic disease later in life. This study will use mobile technologies to collect intensive longitudinal data on micro-temporal mechanisms underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, limited sedentary time, and sufficient sleep duration in emerging adults. Results will be used to build more predictive health behavior theories and inform personalized behavior interventions to reduce obesity and improve public health.",Microtemporal Processes Underlying Health Behavior Adoption and Maintenance,10336709,U01HL146327,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Buffers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Sleep', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'attentional control', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'emerging adult', 'emerging adulthood', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'lifetime risk', 'mobile computing', 'moderate-to-vigorous physical activity', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'parent grant', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'successful intervention', 'theories', 'weight gain prevention', 'young adult']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2021,21332
"The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD Project Summary To reduce the increasing societal and financial burden of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), prevention is critical. Even small improvements of the modifiable dementia risk factors on the individual level have the potential to lead to a substantial reduction of dementia cases at the population level. The disease processes occur for years though symptoms typically appear after age 60. Thus, identifying those at risk early for intervention is crucial. Studies among adults aged 60 years and older have identified performance-based measures of impairment in physical function as early indicators of ADRD, three or more years prior to onset. To improve earlier prediction of ADRD, we need research on adults aged 51-59 years to assess the relationship between physical functional impairment and likelihood of ADRD onset years later. Further, given the burden of administering performance-based measures of physical function, it would be advantageous to use patient- reported metrics of limitation in physical function for ADRD prediction. We propose using the 1998-2018 nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS) of adults aged 51-59 years to determine the extent to which patient-reported measures of function would facilitate efficient ADRD risk identification. Primary study aims are to: 1) To identify the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function in midlife predict future late-onset ADRD. We will use standardized (RAND HRS) self-reported measures of function and the Langa-Weir ADRD algorithm available in the HRS. Working hypothesis: Limitations in physical function, defined using summary measures of self-reported physical function predict onset of ADRD 4 to 20 years later. 2) Verify that sub-groups of adults, defined by limitations in physical function, aged 51-59 are at higher risk of developing ADRD. We will verify existence of sub-groups (identified in our preliminary analyses) using a computational systems approach (cluster analysis) are predictive of onset of ADRD through 2018, in adjusted analyses. Working hypothesis: Sub-groups of middle-aged adults with unique patterns of limitations in physical function are at higher risk of developing ADRD than those without physical functional deficit 4 to 20 years later, independent of related factors. This proposal addresses the objectives of PAS-19-391 in several ways. First, the Principal investigator (PI), an early stage investigator, is committed to a career in ADRD research. Second, the investigative team has training in non-neurological medical fields and will shift their research focus to ADRD prevention within their fields. Third, the PI has experience with an existing dataset (HRS); and will use it to assess age-related changes in non-cognitive processes that may be early signs of ADRD. Finally, the PI published an HRS study reporting that physical functional decline precedes the onset of diabetes, a risk factor for ADRD. Our proposal builds on this work. The successful completion of the proposed study will ascertain the extent to which self-reported impairment in physical function during midlife, predicts future ADRD, thereby offering a new, efficient mechanism for early identification of ADRD. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because the number of people living with dementia is expected to triple worldwide by 2050 unless effective measures to treat or delay the onset of the disease are implemented.1 The same study found that about 35% of ADRD could be delayed or prevented through modifiable health and lifestyle factors from different phases of life. To identify adults at risk of ADRD early, our study among adults aged 51-59 seeks to determine the extent to which self-reported measures of physical function are early indicators of ADRD and to identify sub-groups of people with unique patterns of limitation in physical function that are early indicators of ADRD.",The Role of Impaired Physical Function during Midlife on Predicting future ADRD,10106121,R03AG070668,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Blood', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Financial Hardship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health and Retirement Study', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Activity', 'Muscle', 'Nursing Homes', 'Observational Study', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention trial', 'Preventive measure', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Subjects Selections', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'base', 'career', 'dementia risk', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'functional disability', 'grasp', 'high risk', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'performance based measurement', 'prevent']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,287889
"Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Summary: Immune Basis and Clinical Implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy Peanut allergy (PA) is common, affecting 2-5% of school-age children in the US. The characteristics of PA vary widely among individuals, with some reacting to 1/100th of a peanut and others not having symptoms until they have ingested many peanuts. Symptoms can vary from mild rashes to fatal anaphylaxis. There is no FDA- approved treatment, and all patients with PA are managed with strict allergen avoidance. Most research on PA has focused on those with the most exquisite sensitivity to peanut. Immunotherapy trials commonly exclude subjects with a threshold dose over 1/3 of a peanut (100mg). However, most individuals with PA have higher thresholds of reaction and are excluded from current research approaches. We hypothesize that the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity for investigation. We have shown that milk or egg allergic individuals with tolerance to baked forms of these foods not only tolerate their inclusion in the diet, but this exposure increases the rate of resolution 14-16-fold. We hypothesize that dietary exposure to sub-threshold levels of peanut in those with higher threshold levels of reactivity could lead to significant clinical improvement. Furthermore, studying the natural heterogeneity of PA is a valuable opportunity to elucidate mechanisms of disease. To study the clinical implications and mechanism of phenotypic heterogeneity in PA, we will conduct a randomized open feeding trial (CAFETERIA trial) to investigate a prototype approach where children with moderate PA (tolerating at least 100 mg of peanut) ingest a sub-threshold amount daily, with increasing levels tested every 3 months. The impact of dietary intervention will be tested at 1 and 2 years by oral food challenge. The CAFETERIA study will provide a rich biorepository of samples from highly phenotyped subjects. We anticipate screening 200-250 subjects, including low threshold, high threshold, and sensitized but not allergic, in order to enroll 98 subjects that meet the high threshold criteria for the CAFETERIA trial. We will obtain longitudinal samples from subjects randomized to dietary therapy or avoidance. We will comprehensively profile antibody responses by high-throughput epitope assay, peanut-specific T cell responses by flow cytometry, and whole blood activation by CyTOF to construct a detailed clinical-immune network of PA, and analyze the relationship between immune and clinical parameters. We will identify biomarkers and key causal drivers of PA by performing integrated network-based examination of peripheral blood transcriptomes from PA subjects, sampled before and after food challenge, and before and after dietary therapy. Successful completion of these aims will result in (1) a simple low-cost treatment option applicable to the majority of those with PA; (2) an identification of immune and molecular mechanisms of PA and response to dietary therapy; (3) peripheral blood biomarkers that will practically impact clinical care of PA; (4) the potential for personalized approaches to the treatment of PA; and (5) a tremendously rich resource of clinical, immune, and transcriptional data and analytic tools to be made publicly available to the research community. NARRATIVE This AADCR Center will investigate threshold-based phenotypic heterogeneity of peanut allergy. We will focus on an under-studied high-threshold phenotype of peanut allergy, and examine the impact of dietary therapy with sub-threshold amounts of peanut. We will use this clinically diverse cohort to perform high dimensional profiling in order to elucidate immune and molecular mechanisms of allergy and tolerance to peanut.",Immune Basis & Clinical implications of Threshold-Based Phenotypes of Peanut Allergy,10167620,U19AI136053,"['Affect', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergy to eggs', 'Allergy to peanuts', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Diet therapy', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Exanthema', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Funding', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Milk', 'Milk Hypersensitivity', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Nutritional', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'School-Age Population', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Symptoms', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Urticaria', 'Visit', 'Whole Blood', 'allergic response', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data tools', 'desensitization', 'dietary', 'egg', 'feeding', 'food allergen', 'food challenge', 'high dimensionality', 'immunotherapy trials', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'learning network', 'neglect', 'oral diagnostics', 'oral immunotherapy', 'outcome prediction', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'prototype', 'response', 'screening', 'transcriptome']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U19,2021,1524872
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up.

"Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors ABSTRACT Cancer survivors are a growing population in the United States; more than 16 million currently live in the US and by 2030 this number is expected to exceed 22 million. It is estimated that more than 50 percent of new cancer cases could be eliminated through a combination of healthy behaviors (e.g., physical activity and healthy diet); and cancer survivors are at high risk for developing new and recurrent cancer. Unfortunately, a significant percentage of cancer survivors are not attaining the cancer preventive guidelines of healthy diet and physical activity. In the past few decades, a variety of telephone-based lifestyle interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in helping survivors meet cancer preventive guidelines, however these trials are labor intensive and expensive to deliver, limiting their potential for broad dissemination. We propose to address this hurdle by taking advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence to reduce the cost and maximize the impact of these much-needed interventions. Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are analytical techniques that automatically learn from direct and indirect patterns in data. We propose to use machine learned algorithms to analyze speech to aid in predicting who may be at risk of poor adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors. These speech data will come from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) study, a telephone-based lifestyle intervention testing whether a diet low in fat and high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber, coupled with increased physical activity will increase time to disease progression in 1200 ovarian cancer survivors who have recently completed treatment, as compared to an attention control. Intervention coaches employed motivational interviewing to elicit behavior change and all calls on the LIVES trial were recorded with repeat assessments of diet, physical activity, patient reported and clinical outcomes. We will use this existing and robust longitudinal data set, which pairs conversational speech data with explicit outcomes, to achieve the following objectives. 1) Develop a ML model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change in diet and physical activity given the comprehensive LIVES data set, utilizing voice recorded calls, demographics, and clinical and patient reported outcomes collected at multiple time points. 2) Decompose the ML model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to the intervention protocol, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting behavior change, as well as adherence to intervention goals. This decomposition will directly enable early and targeted adjustments to intervention plans for individuals, reducing the cost and increasing the efficacy of intervention strategies. ML and NLP methods can produce models that listen to a coaching conversation and automatically predict whether it will result in positive change towards enactment of healthy lifestyle behaviors. Such predictive models would enable more efficient, effective, and individualized lifestyle interventions, the first step towards personalized behavioral medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study examines whether artificial intelligence can use speech and audio from health coaching calls to predict who is most likely to enact healthy lifestyle behaviors of diet and physical activity. This project uses previously collected data from the Lifestyle Intervention for Ovarian Cancer Enhanced Survival (LIVES) Study to 1) Develop a machine learning model to identify patterns in the interactions between coaches and their participants that signal a likelihood of optimal behavior change of healthy lifestyle and 2) Decompose the machine learning model in terms of “intervenable factors”, so that participant affect, coach adherence to fidelity protocols, and other important aspects of the interaction can be individually evaluated for their role in predicting healthy lifestyle behavior change and adherence to intervention goals.",Using natural language processing to determine predictors of healthy diet and physical activity behavior change in ovarian cancer survivors,10109452,R21CA256680,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'American', 'American Cancer Society', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Fruit', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Trial of Labor', 'United States', 'Vegetables', 'Voice', 'anticancer research', 'attentional control', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral adherence', 'behavioral outcome', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'demographics', 'experience', 'good diet', 'healthy lifestyle', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle data', 'lifestyle intervention', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2021,209312
"Novel machine learning and missing data methods for improving estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep using accelerometer data PROJECT SUMMARY We propose novel statistical and machine learning methods for processing and analyzing accelerometer data for studying physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep and their effects on outcomes such as cardiovascular health. Methods to accurately estimate and characterize physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep are crucially needed. Accelerometers have been widely adopted as the standard objective measure of movement in free-living humans. Recent advances have spawned instruments that collect enormous amounts of data that has far outpaced the research community’s ability to meaningfully interpret them. Current studies rely on outdated methods for identifying non-wear and addressing missing data, potentially yielding biased and inefficient estimates of relationships between behavioral activity patterns and outcomes. Importantly, methods for distinguishing between non-wear periods and those that represent sedentary behavior or sleep have not been validated using a gold standard in free-living contexts. The handling of non-wear periods using a statistically valid approach that exploits the multivariate and time- series nature of the data has yet to be developed. Thus, new methods are needed to address current gaps. We propose developing and validating an ensemble classifier to distinguish non-wear time. We will adapt and validate multiple imputation methods that exploit the multivariate and time-series nature of the data to handle non-wear time in analyses that make use of entire profiles of physical activity. Specifically, we will evaluate methods for incorporating multiple imputation for handling missing data from non-wear when applying adaptive clustering algorithms to identify distinct patterns of sleep and activity in order to relate them to outcomes in a generalized linear mixed effects model framework. We will create open-source user-friendly software that can be adopted and enhanced by the research community. Our approach integrates three novel data resources to develop our methods – two with knowledge of true activity and non-wear, and a third generated from a unique four-year longitudinal time series for both accelerometry and cardiovascular risk factor measures in a real- world setting. It offers an opportunity to develop and illustrate methods using data generated from wearable devices in a natural environment that includes missing data. This is the first study to incorporate missing data methods into learning algorithms under a generalized linear mixed effects model framework for accelerometer studies. Such methods will be critical for both observational and clinical trial research in real-world settings, where wear and non-wear time are not directly observed. The resulting insights and tools will also be highly applicable to the processing and analysis of other types of intensively sampled serial data, such as those generated from mobile digital devices. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to fill important gaps in current methods by developing a comprehensive set of tools to analyze accelerometer data to better understand the links between physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep and outcomes such as cardiovascular health, and to make open-source user-friendly software available to apply them. We propose methods to identify and account for non-wear periods through machine learning and multiple imputation approaches under a generalized linear mixed effects model framework in order to correlate behaviors with outcomes. The methods we develop and validate will be useful for studying questions of great importance to public health such as identifying signature patterns of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep that may be favorable for cardiovascular health and will provide insights into analytic approaches for studies that involve other types of monitoring data with public health relevance.","Novel machine learning and missing data methods for improving estimates of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep using accelerometer data",10120571,R01LM013355,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'Gaussian model', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'data resource', 'diabetes risk', 'digital', 'health data', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'monitoring device', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'open source', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'sedentary', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'simulation', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep pattern', 'standard measure', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'waist circumference', 'wearable device']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,328975
"Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity ABSTRACT Regular exercise (physical activity) is the most effective intervention that promotes health and combats non- communicable disease (NCD). However, our understanding of the molecule(s) responsible for the superb benefits of exercise is obscure. The NIH Common Fund project “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC)” is a large-scale discovery study designed to understand the molecular responses to exercise training, which has released the first batch of multi-omics data, including RNA-seq, Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing, proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylproteomics, and targeted and untargeted metabolomics, from 5 tissues collected at different time points in rats following an acute bout of endurance exercise. These endeavors have laid a solid foundation for elucidation of the molecular transducer of physical activity. We have recently made significant progress in four areas, which poised us to explore these data and elucidate the mechanism(s) in an unprecedented manner. Specifically, 1) We have obtained similar time-course, transcriptomics data in 4 tissues in mice following acute and long-term endurance exercise and developed machine learning capability for mining the multi-omics data for identification of regulatory factors that mediate the exercise benefits; 2) We have perfected CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for generation of loss- of-function knock-in mice as well as techniques to generate tissue-specific, inducible gain-of-function transgenic mice; 3) We have established comprehensive phenotypic analysis in mice; and 4) We have had a successful experience in elucidating the regulation and function of extracellular superoxide dismutase (EcSOD), a humoral factor expressed in skeletal muscle and promoted by endurance exercise, in mediating the health benefits and protection against diseases. We hypothesize that endurance exercise promotes expression and release of one or more humoral factors from one or multiple tissues/organs, which is sufficient and necessary mediating the health benefits of exercise. To this end, we propose 1) Identify candidate molecular transducers of physical activity by machine learning-based multi-omics modeling. 2) Generate loss-of-function knock-in and tissue-specific, gain-of-function transgenic mice using CRISPR/Cas9- mediated gene editing and transgenesis. 3) Elucidate the role of the candidate molecular transducers of physical activity in health benefits of exercise. The experimental design and model systems are both conceptually and technically innovative. The findings will significantly improve the mechanistic understanding of exercise-induced adaptations with great potential impact on the future development of therapeutics for NCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Since ancient times, physical activity has been well-known to improve health and prevents disease, but the understanding of biological molecule(s) responsible for the health benefits is still obscure. We formed a multi- disciplinary team to employ computational machine learning to explore the multi-omics data obtained from MoTrPAC to identify the potential molecule(s) followed by the state-of-the-art gene editing in mice to elucidate how this molecule(s) could transduce the health benefits of physical activity.",Machine learning-based multi-omics modeling and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in elucidating molecular transducer of physical activity,10264175,U01AG070960,"['Acute', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Exercise', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrinogen', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Promotion', 'Health protection', 'Heart', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Ligands', 'Liver', 'Liver Circulation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Organ', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psyche structure', 'Rattus', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Solid', 'Superoxide Dismutase', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus Helper Peptide', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transducers', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Mice', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autocrine', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'endurance exercise', 'exercise capacity', 'exercise training', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mental function', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'paracrine', 'phenotypic data', 'phosphoproteomics', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'skeletal', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutically effective', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,U01,2021,521758
"Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs 1 PROJECT SUMMARY  Millions of U.S. adults living with prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk of type 2 diabetes. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent a potential scalable solution to address this far-reaching problem. The objective of this project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of a digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to standard of care in- person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs). This study will test a novel, fully-automated digital health platform (Sweetch Health, Ltd.) that uses artificial intelligence technology to provide just-in-time and adaptive lifestyle change coaching for prediabetic adults. Preliminary evidence from feasibility or observational studies suggests that JITAIs, which are often delivered via smartphone apps by virtue of their ability to provide continuous self-monitoring and feedback, can be effective. However, it is currently not known whether dDPPs that deliver a JITAI are as effective as ipDPPs in improving health outcomes in patients with prediabetes, a susceptible patient population that is positioned to benefit from such an intervention.  The overarching goal of this project, therefore, is to compare the effectiveness of the Sweetch digital diabetes prevention program (dDPP) to real-world in-person diabetes prevention programs (ipDPPs) for promoting weight loss, increasing physical activity, and reducing hemoglobin A1C in prediabetic adults. The proposed study addresses an evidence gap in the science of chronic disease prevention and health behavior change and is supported by promising short-term results from a previous pilot trial conducted by our team. Building on our previous study and leveraging the collective expertise of our multidisciplinary study team, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 382 overweight/obese, prediabetic adults ages 18-75 with 6 and 12 month follow-up visits: Arm 1 (N=191) will receive the fully automated Sweetch digital health kit (“dDPP” arm) and Arm 2 (N=191) will be referred to a local CDC-recognized ipDPP. Both arms will have physical activity measured serially during the trial using actimetry at baseline and 2 month intervals. We hypothesize that the dDPP will be more effective than the ipDPP for the outcomes of weight loss, physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C at 6 months, with sustained effects at 12 months. We further hypothesize that the overall engagement and acceptability will be greater in the dDPP, and that the superiority of the dDPP on clinical outcomes will be mediated by higher engagement in this arm.  This project will advance chronic disease prevention and behavioral science research by elucidating the extent to which fully-automated digital interventions using artificial intelligence technology can deliver effective, scalable, sustainable, and cost-effective health-promoting behavioral change interventions in high-risk populations. The implications of this fully-automated approach for scalability in diabetes prevention are profound. 2 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Prediabetes, a high risk state for future type 2 diabetes, currently affects nearly 1 in 3 Americans, the vast majority of whom do not receive appropriate lifestyle counseling to lower their risk for type 2 diabetes. In this project, we propose to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of a fully-automated digital diabetes prevention program for weight reduction, promotion of physical activity, and lowering of hemoglobin A1C (a measure of average blood glucose control) compared to standard of care in-person diabetes prevention programs. Since this digital diabetes prevention program uses artificial technology and requires no human component, it would potentially offer a breakthrough in improving population health in a scalable and cost- effective way, helping the tens of millions of affected U.S. patients and hundreds of millions of patients globally living with prediabetes.",Effectiveness of Digital Versus In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs,10259878,R01DK125780,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Glucose', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Favorable Clinical Outcome', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior change', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediabetes syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinical outcome measures', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'diabetes prevention program', 'digital', 'digital health', 'digital intervention', 'disorder prevention', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'interest', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mHealth', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pilot trial', 'population health', 'program costs', 'programs', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,714718
