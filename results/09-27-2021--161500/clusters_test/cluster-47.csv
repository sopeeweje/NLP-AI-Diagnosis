"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,10076848,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,395000
"Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes PROJECT SUMMARY The advent of surgery to treat congenital heart disease (CHD) in the second half of the 20th century shifted the care paradigm from palliation of disease fatal in infancy to management of lifelong chronic disease through adulthood. There are now more than 1.5 million adults with CHD living in the United States. These patients have a substantial burden of cardiovascular and other medical comorbidities, as well as markedly increased risk for adverse outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, and premature death. The emergence of this population requires new clinical care models as well as the development of novel research tools and infrastructures to address these patients' unique characteristics and healthcare needs. Adult CHD is characterized by substantial complexity, era-dependent heterogeneity in treatment strategies, and time-varying implications of lifelong disease. This burgeoning population is understudied, and the pathophysiology of the component diseases remains incompletely understood. Billing and other administrative codes available in the electronic medical record are neither sensitive nor specific for CHD diagnosis and do not adequately describe many other salient clinical features. As a result, structured data in large administrative databases are not well suited to studying adults with CHD, even when the goal is simply to identify a cohort of patients with a given diagnosis. This constitutes a major impediment to research efforts and is the primary barrier underlying the limited population-based research performed to date. Adult CHD investigation would benefit immensely from methods to establish harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets. While billing codes are inadequate, the information needed to accurately classify adults with CHD is already available in the electronic medical record in the form of clinical notes, comprised mainly of unstructured (“free”) text. Manual data extraction is laborious, resource intensive, and, therefore, not scalable. We propose to apply cutting-edge natural language processing approaches to unstructured text in the electronic medical record to develop computable classifiers for variables fundamental to the study of adults with CHD. We will use two unique institutional data resources at Boston Children's Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital that are already populated with expert-adjudicated labels to train classifiers for key phenotypes that are poorly defined by administrative codes. These classifiers will be validated in an independent patient cohort at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and tested in new disease-specific risk prediction models. This work promises to accelerate CHD research by massively increasing the scale of the patient cohorts that can be studied and by establishing a foundation for improved evidence-based decision support for this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE Administrative billing codes are inadequate to support research for adults with congenital heart disease, a growing but understudied population with a high burden of medical comorbidities. To advance high quality research towards much-needed innovations in clinical care for these patients, we plan to develop novel methods for the creation of harmonized, large-scale, multi-center datasets that will expand and enhance collaborative research efforts.",Accelerating research to advance care for adults with congenital heart disease through development of validated scalable computational phenotypes,10214688,R01HL151604,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Heart Septal Defects', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Specificity', 'Disease', 'Eisenmenger Complex', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'ICD-9', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Nomenclature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Research', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transposition of Great Vessels', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'administrative database', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical data repository', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computable phenotypes', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data resource', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'large-scale database', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'palliation', 'patient population', 'population based', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'risk prediction model', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,738379
"Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development Project Summary  Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a life-threatening birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major congenital anomalies. In cases where CDH co-occurs with cardiovascular malformations (CVMs), mortality rates increase from 30 to 60%, and long-term morbidity is common. Our goal is to identify genes that cause CDH and CDH/CVM, and to discover the mechanism by which they control diaphragm and heart development.  Correctly identifying genes that contribute to specific phenotypes from the large list of candidate genes data generated in research and clinical studies is a major obstacle to progress in this and other research fields. In Specific Aim #1, we will address this challenge by generating ranked CDH and CDH/CVM pathogenicity scores for all RefSeq genes using a machine-learning algorithm that integrates data from large-scale genomic knowledge sources. We will use these scores to identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes from cytogenetically defined critical regions and form large next-generation sequencing databases as part of our multifaceted approach to novel gene discovery. We will also accelerate the pace at which human disease genes are discovered by making these scores and our machine-learning algorithm freely available.  8p23.1 microdeletions that encompass GATA4 and SOX7 are among the most frequently identified causes of CDH/CVM. In RNA-seq studies, we identified several CDH-associated genes that are dysregulated in the E15.5 diaphragms of Gata4flox/flox;Prx1-Cre embryos. These embryos are an ideal model of the sac hernias that comprise 20% of human CDH cases. In Specific Aim #2, we will combine data from RNA-seq and BioChIP-seq analyses with the priority scores generated in Aim #1 to identify primary GATA4 target genes whose dysregulation contribute to the development of sac CDH. We will then determine if alterations in the expression of these target genes can cause CDH, or can modify the CDH phenotypes of GATA4-deficient mice.  We have shown that SOX7 deficiency causes septal defects by decreasing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the developing heart. In RNA-seq and in situ hybridization studies we have shown that the expression of Wnt4—a key regulator of EMT in the endocardium—is severely decreased in E9.5 Sox7-/- hearts. In Specific Aim #3 we will determine if Wnt4 is a primary target of SOX7, and whether modulation of WNT4 or its downstream effectors can rescue SOX7-related cardiac phenotypes.  Several lines of evidence suggset that WNT4 is a novel CDH/CVM gene in humans. To confirm this association, and learn more about the role of WNT4 in diaphragm and heart development, we will determine if WNT4 deficiency causes CDH/CVM in mice, if Sox7 and Wnt4 interact genetically in the development of CDH/CVM and if SOX7 regulates Wnt4 transcripition in the developing diaphragm.  Through these studies we will identify novel CDH and CDH/CVM genes and pathways. The bioinformatic tools we develop in this grant will enhance gene discovery efforts across multiple research fields. Project Narrative Diaphragmatic hernias and cardiovascular malformations are serious birth defects. In this study, we will use bioinformatics and mouse models to identify genes that cause these birth defects and to learn how they work. These experiments will help us to understand how the diaphragm and heart form prior to birth and may ultimately lead to new ways of treating or preventing these birth defects.",Mechanisms of Abnormal Diaphragm and Cardiac Development,10201699,R01HD098458,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Association Learning', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital diaphragmatic hernia', 'Cytogenetics', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diaphragmatic Hernia', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Encyclopedias', 'Endocardium', 'Endothelium', 'Foundations', 'GATA4 gene', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Hernia', 'Human', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Luciferases', 'Mesenchymal', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Diaphragm', 'Role', 'SOX7 gene', 'Source', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'WNT4 gene', 'Work', 'biochip', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cardiogenesis', 'congenital anomaly', 'data modeling', 'dosage', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'genome database', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malformation', 'microdeletion', 'molecular sequence database', 'mortality', 'mouse genome', 'mouse model', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'prevent', 'research study', 'septal defect', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'web based interface']",NICHD,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,448377
"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"Reading workstation for clinical contrast echocardiography Proposal Summary There is increasing appreciation of a syndrome in which patients female patients, present with chest pain due to myocardial ischemia and have a normal or near normal coronary angiogram. Termed coronary microvascular dysfunction (MVD) this disorder is not benign with cardiovascular event rates similar to those with established coronary artery disease. Clinical tools are therefore needed to both identify MVD patients and better understand the mechanisms causing myocardial ischemia. There is evidence that myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) provides incremental information in the evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease, myocardial viability, or diseases of the microvasculature. Despite data demonstrating the diagnostic and prognostic benefit of MCE in evaluating patients with MVD, its clinical use has been limited to only a handful of experts in the field, because there are currently no widely available clinical tools to support MCE quantitative analysis and interpretation. The overall aim of this Phase I proposal is to provide clinicians with a new tool to evaluate the myocardial flow-function relationship that is critical to identifying patients with MVD by using echocardiography. We will develop clinical software that can rapidly process MCE data into a standardized, quantitative and easy- to- interpret format. In Aim 1, the power of image averaging and computer aided assessment of radial wall thickening will be used to enhance the current standard of care which relies solely on readers' visual estimation of segmental function. An algorithm will be developed to rearrange the order of images so that images representing the same phase of the cardiac cycle are grouped together. Functional analysis will then be developed using computer-aided tracings of epicardial and endocardial borders. In Aim 2, a software module for quantitative analysis of real-time MCE perfusion will be developed that will incorporate statistical confidence, derived from the performance of image processing algorithms to inform the interpreter about the data strength. Machine learning will be utilized to train and deploy a neural network for the pixel-by-pixel assessment of myocardial perfusion. In Aim 3, we will combine myocardial perfusion and function modules into a novel, perfusion-function mode of imaging (PF-mode). This new mode will be applied to an archival sample of clinically diagnosed MVD cases to demonstrate the feasibility to detect abnormalities in the myocardial flow-function relationship. The composite PF-mode will include a cine-loop rendered for one cardiac cycle where parametric images (perfusion) are superimposed over averaged ultrasound images with an overlay of graphic representation of wall thickness (function). This novel mode of imaging provides the means to diagnose MVD in a single clinical study. Project Narrative Project Title: Reading workstation for clinical contrast echocardiography Despite a wealth of evidence that myocardial contrast echocardiography imaging of myocardial perfusion provides incremental information in the evaluation of patients with diseases of the myocardial microvasculature (MVD), its clinical use has been limited to only a handful of experts in the field. In this proposal, we have created a multidisciplinary partnership between physicians-scientists and engineers with the overall aim to address this clinical gap that exists between a proven echocardiographic technique and the technology necessary to enable widespread adoption of MCE clinically. We will develop a software program enabling a new method for evaluating the myocardial flow-function relationship using echocardiography that will enable the identification of MVD using MCE studies at the level of expert readers.",Reading workstation for clinical contrast echocardiography,10155647,R43HL152939,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Apical', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chest Pain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Color', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contrast Echocardiography', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Eye', 'Female', 'Guidelines', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Names', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Societies', 'Software Engineering', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Vendor', 'Visual', 'arteriole', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'image processing', 'imaging software', 'indexing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'sample archive', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,"NARNAR, LLC",R43,2021,252399
"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing.

"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients.

"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10217254,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,760832
"A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is mounting concern that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experience unexpectedly high rates of cardiac and vascular events. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for COVID-19-related cardiovascular events and delineating how these events affect short- and long-term outcomes may help support individualized patient care, illuminate underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and accelerate the development of effective therapies. However, little is known about how multi-dimensional risk factors, including prior medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators, and circulating levels of biomarkers affect patient outcomes. Building on our team's expertise in data linkage, prediction modeling, and biomarker discovery, we will create a unique and powerful linked data resource to characterize the biological, clinical, health system, and socioeconomic risk factors for the development of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and examine their impact on health outcomes. To create this data resource, we have partnered with the American Heart Association, whose COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is actively capturing high-quality, standardized information on all adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at >100 U.S. sites spanning 30 states. We will link this registry to comprehensive health care claims, a national socioeconomic deprivation index, and detailed health care system information. In Aim 1, we will apply traditional and machine learning approaches to the linked multicenter registry in order to identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will characterize long-term MACE (i.e., at 1 and 2 years after discharge from the index COVID-19 hospitalization) among older adults in a large multicenter registry linked with longitudinal Medicare claims, and identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict their occurrence. Based on this work, we will create clinically implementable risk scores which will estimate, at the time of admission for and discharge from an index COVID-19 hospitalization, a patient's risk of developing a major cardiovascular event. In Aim 3, we evaluate the proteomic profiles of a subset of patients in the linked registry with biobanked serial blood samples, and identify biochemical markers that predict the occurrence of MACE, both during index hospitalization for COVID-19 and after discharge. This research will advance our collective understanding of the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By identifying patients at greatest at risk of cardiovascular events, our work will help frontline clinicians better individualize clinical management strategies and health systems improve care delivery during future waves of the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular events (heart damage, stroke, blood clots) appear to be both common and dangerous in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. A better understanding of which patients are at highest risk for these events is a key step to developing better approaches for prevention and treatment. We will combine multiple sources of information, including a large national COVID-19 registry from the American Heart Association, health care data from Medicare, and blood protein levels from patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to identify the factors that are associated with a higher risk of short- and long-term cardiovascular events among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events",10183512,R01HL157530,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American Heart Association', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Embolism', 'Event', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Israel', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocarditis', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention approach', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'disease registry', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'heart damage', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'medical information system', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized management', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'rurality', 'socioeconomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,873210
"Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses Five to 10% of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) die before age 30, but our ability to predict which patients will experience death, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (DVTF) is limited. The optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), which may delay DVTF, is also not clear. The current best predictors of DVTF and guidance for PVR timing rely on “traditional” measures such as right ventricular volume and ejection fraction, which are derived from cardiac MRI (CMR). However, even the best DVTF models have limited predictive power, and these “traditional” volumetric measures fail to predict appropriate response to PVR for 30-40% of patients. This proposal aims to address the critical need for CMR based- metrics that correlate with DVTF and predict response to PVR better than traditional ventricular volumetrics. This will be accomplished through the development of ventricular deformation-, kinematic-, and geometry- based mechanics metrics for rTOF patients from routinely acquired, standard of care CMR datasets, which would allow rapid implementation in clinical practice. The critical need will be addressed through two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop and evaluate novel CMR-based predictors of clinical outcomes in patients with rTOF. Specific Aim 2: Prospectively assess ventricular geometry-based predictors of response to pulmonary valve replacement in rTOF patients. The rationale is that if computational modeling techniques can generate metrics that outperform traditional markers, they can be used to change current patient management with the eventual goal to delay DVTF. The failure to develop improved metrics will lead to continued excess mortality and suboptimal clinical outcomes for patients with rTOF. The combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches allows a more comprehensive assessment of CMR metrics in a population where randomized controlled trials are not feasible. This work has the potential for rapid implementation and thus to mark a paradigm shift in the use of computational modeling in clinical cardiology. The candidate’s career goal is to be an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary research teams to develop new, more accurate, and easily applied outcome predictors for congenital heart disease (CHD). This would place him at the nexus of clinical pediatric cardiology, biomedical engineering, and computer science. To achieve this goal, he will learn about machine learning and kinematic analyses, their strengths and pitfalls, and the data characteristics needed for these analyses. He will learn how to bring his findings to clinical practice and design studies using the newly developed metrics. He will then design R01-funded research to prospectively assess the performance of the ventricular mechanical metrics to guide PVR and predict DVTF. This will all be accomplished through a dedicated, multi-disciplinary mentor/advisor team, a supportive academic environment, and didactic and hands-on training. At the completion of this training, the applicant plans to be a world leader in the application of advanced imaging analytics for congenital heart disease. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because patients with tetralogy of Fallot, the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease affecting ~1:2500 babies, have increased risk of heart failure and premature death despite excellent initial surgery. Development of non-invasive, easily obtained, and rapidly implemented metrics of ventricular mechanics are needed to improve prediction of death and allow optimization of pulmonary valve replacement timing. This project is relevant to the NHLBI’s mission because the tools developed here, and the skills learned, could then be applied to other forms of congenital and structural heart disease, and promote longer and more fulfilling lives for patients.","Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses",10127094,K23HL150279,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'EFRAC', 'Environment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tetralogy of Fallot', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'design', 'early experience', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'premature', 'prospective', 'pulmonary valve replacement', 'repaired', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'structural heart disease', 'tool', 'vector']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,169351
"Mentoring Patient Oriented Research in Innovative Imaging and High-dimensional Data Approaches to Improve Outcomes in Cardiac Amyloidosis Project Summary/Abstract Dr Sharmila Dorbala is an Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a physician/scientist at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). She has devoted her career to patient-oriented research focusing on cardiac amyloidosis. She contributed independently to the field of cardiac amyloidosis through a succession of substantive studies utilizing molecular imaging to phenotype cardiac amyloidosis in order to diagnose and manage this condition. Her research program is impactful, both directly and through effective mentoring of the next generation of amyloidosis investigators. Dr. Dorbala has successfully mentored 26 pre- and post-doctoral trainees in patient- oriented research projects. She is currently PI of two active NIH R01 grants and also has funding from AHA and foundation/industrial sources. Her program provides a unique opportunity for POR due to the intersection of resources from programs in clinical investigation at the Harvard School of Public Health and the BWH cardiovascular imaging T32 program. Her mentees have presented their work nationally and internationally, published papers, and won research awards and pilot grants. The new research aims proposed in this award lay the foundation for adjunct interventions to enhance transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) therapies and novel image-based personalized strategies to predict treatment failure. She will assess (1) sonoporation, a therapeutic ultrasound technique to increase myocardial perfusion and, consequently, improve delivery of antifibril drugs; (2) shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome to inform development of nutrition-based adjunct therapies; (3) radiomics of 99mTc- pyrophosphate SPECT/CT to assess treatment response, and (4) machine learning based CT-derived sarcopenia metric to predict survival. This research has important clinical implications. Currently approved TTR stabilizing/silencing drugs, though lifesaving for most, are not effective in about 30% of patients. Moreover, while these therapies improve clinical outcomes, they do not treat amyloid fibril. Fibril-targeted therapies have been unsuccessful to date, probably because of poor interstitial drug delivery due to the presence of fibril. The results of the proposed mentoring and research activities of this K24 project are likely to not only substantially improve outcomes and alleviate HF symptoms in these gravely ill patients, but also transform her patient- oriented research program into a formal individualized program of mentoring with a focus on preventing heart failure from amyloidosis. Project Narrative Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, a particularly deadly form of heart failure, can now be treated by recently developed medications. The proposed projects will develop new heart imaging approaches to determine who is likely to respond to the new medicines, test a new ultrasound-based therapy to improve blood flow to the heart muscle and thereby improve delivery of novel drugs to the heart, and study bacteria in the stool with the goal of eventually developing diet-based strategies to address cardiac amyloidosis. In developing methods to improve treatments for amyloidosis, this project will support expansion of Dr. Dorbala’s patient oriented research program and enhance training for her mentees.",Mentoring Patient Oriented Research in Innovative Imaging and High-dimensional Data Approaches to Improve Outcomes in Cardiac Amyloidosis,10191887,K24HL157648,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Ammonia', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Amyloidosis', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Volume', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diphosphates', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'EFRAC', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prealbumin', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Protein Precursors', 'Proteins', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient', 'Symptoms', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data registry', 'effective therapy', 'extracellular', 'fecal microbiota', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'hazard', 'heart imaging', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'medical schools', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'mid-career faculty', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrition', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized strategies', 'pre-doctoral', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'sonoporation', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'β-amyloid burden']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2021,121599
"Defining the molecular regulators of valvular delamination via multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiac valves are critical to the maintenance of unidirectional blood flow in the heart. Congenital and acquired valvulopathies are a major source of morbidity and mortality in both the pediatric and adult populations. Current therapeutic strategies are limited, often requiring surgical replacement with suboptimal prostheses. Valvulogenesis begins with formation of the endocardial cushions via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Many of the signaling pathways regulating this EMT event have been defined; however, little is known about the molecular regulators of post-EMT valvulogenesis. Ebstein’s Anomaly, a rare congenital heart defect, is characterized by variably dysplastic, muscularized tricuspid valve leaflets that are often tethered to the underlying myocardium, resulting in apical displacement of the annulus and atrialization of the right ventricle. This defect is often attributed to a failure of valvular delamination – a critical morphogenetic step of post-EMT valvulogenesis during which the primordial valve leaflets separate from the underlying myocardium. Previous studies suggest that altered differentiation dynamics of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) may contribute to the pathogenesis of this valvular defect. I propose to define the molecular regulators of valvular delamination via a multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly, leveraging an Ebstein’s Anomaly murine model system, primary human tissue, and human genetics data. In my first aim, I will use spatiotemporal single cell RNA sequencing and human genetics analyses to identify the atrioventricular cushion signaling interactions regulating valvular delamination. In my second aim, I will use an integrated single cell RNA/ATAC sequencing approach to define the gene regulatory networks driving VIC fate determination. My primary sponsor, Dr. Deepak Srivastava, has extensive expertise in developmental cardiac biology, human genetics, and stem cell biology. My co- sponsor, Dr. Chun (Jimmie) Ye, has an expertise in experimental and computational single cell genomics. Their collective expertise will assure that I receive the necessary training and mentorship to complete the proposed research. To obtain the rare tissue samples required for my project, I have formed a multi-center collaboration with two high volume Ebstein’s Anomaly patient centers. Additionally, I have secured expertise in human genetics and machine learning from Dr. Jingjing Li, Ph.D., in support of the human genetics component of my project. Concurrently, I am engaging in a longitudinal clinical preceptorship in pediatric cardiothoracic surgery with my clinical training co-sponsor, Dr. Peter Kouretas, Surgical Director of the UCSF Pediatric Heart Transplantation Program. Overall, the proposed research will elucidate previously uncharacterized mechanisms of late atrioventricular valvular morphogenesis and inform future efforts toward the development of novel regenerative-medicine based therapeutics for congenital and acquired valvulopathies. F30 NRSA fellowship support would foster my expertise in developmental cardiac biology and computational genomics, furthering me toward my ultimate career goal of becoming an academic pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE The molecular regulators of valvular delamination – a critical morphogenetic step of valvulogenesis whose dysfunction underlies a rare tricuspid valve malformation, Ebstein’s Anomaly – remain largely unknown. I will apply an innovative multi-omic approach to identify the intercellular interactions regulating this morphogenetic process and define the gene regulatory networks that drive valvular interstitial cell fate determination. This study will deepen our understanding of valvulogenesis and inform future efforts toward the development of novel regenerative medicine-based therapeutics for congenital and acquired valvulopathies.",Defining the molecular regulators of valvular delamination via multi-omic dissection of Ebstein’s Anomaly,10233685,F30HL158170,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adult', 'Anatomy', 'Apical', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bar Codes', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Childhood', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dyes', 'Ebstein&apos', 's Anomaly', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart Valves', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Lateral', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mentorship', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Preceptorship', 'Process', 'Prosthesis', 'RNA', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Secure', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Tricuspid valve structure', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'XCL1 gene', 'base', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'career', 'epigenomics', 'epithelial to mesenchymal transition', 'genetic analysis', 'heart pharmacology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'in vivo Model', 'innovation', 'interstitial cell', 'mRNA Expression', 'malformation', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'periostin', 'programs', 'prospective', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell biology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F30,2021,37830
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,10161608,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,787916
"Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery ABSTRACT Neonates (infants ≤ 28 days), especially those with congenital heart disease (CHD), are among the most vulnerable populations cared for by critical care nurses. Approximately, two out of three CHD neonates experience unintentional hypothermia after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Unintentional hypothermia impairs cellular function, which can be linked to poor outcomes frequently reported in this population. To date, there are no studies examining the association between the burden of unintentional hypothermia and clinical outcomes in neonates with CHD. This knowledge would render future opportunities to improve nursing care and prevent avoidable safety events in these vulnerable neonates. To address this gap, we propose to use retrospective data from CardioAccess (database local to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia [CHOP]), which includes one of the largest multicenter repositories of neonatal cardiac surgery data available to date (Pediatric Cardiac Critical Care Consortium [PC4]), as well as, the electronic health record. Using data from at least 432 neonates who have undergone CPB between 2015 and 2019, we will quantify the time course of hourly temperature trajectories within the initial 24–48 hours after CPB and evaluate their relation to key clinical outcomes. We will specifically study the temporal trends of unintentional hypothermia burden (temperature depth and duration), which challenges current practice, where care is based on maintaining a single, preselected temperature threshold that is driven by consensus, rather than evidence. Single threshold values are not dynamic representations of the complexity that makes up temperature. A more robust output, such as an accumulative hypothermia burden index, is needed to assist clinicians with interpretation of this dynamic indicator of overall health. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Identify distinct temporal temperature patterns in CHD neonates after CPB using both: a multilevel model for intensive longitudinal data with group-based trajectory modeling; and an unsupervised machine learning technique using principal component analysis followed by k- means clustering of longitudinal data. 2) Determine the relationship between hypothermia burden subgroups / clusters and important clinical outcomes in this population. Our team has a demonstrated expertise in building clinically relevant and physiologically plausible markers of adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. This study aligns with the NINR’s priorities of promoting wellness and preventing illness across the lifespan, as well as, using recent advances in precision medicine. The research conducted under this award will take place at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing, a research-intensive institution (data analysis), and CHOP (data provision). The personalized training plan outlined in this application, supports the applicant’s career and academic development goals to become an independent nurse researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Unintentional hypothermia can significantly contribute to morbidity and mortality in neonates with congenital heart disease (CHD), which has a prevalence at birth in the USA of ~1% or 40,000 cases per year, and of those, ~6,000 neonates are born with severe defects requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, contributing to a total cost of ~$5.6 billion every year. This will be the first clinical study to define the prevalence of unintentional hypothermia and map its association to neonatal outcomes with CHD, which has major implications for clinical practice. Unveiling the prevalence and consequences of unintentional hypothermia in this vulnerable population will render future opportunities to enhance time to recognition and early choice of preemptive intervention, which can improve the quality and safety of care, save lives and productivity, as well as, health care dollars.",Use of Predictive Analytics to Quantify Neonatal Hypothermia Burden After Cardiac Surgery,10233671,F31NR019725,"['Address', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Birth', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consensus', 'Cost of Illness', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Hypoxemia', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Integumentary system', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'PC4 Gene', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Philadelphia', 'Physiological', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Privatization', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Respiratory distress', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Safety', 'School Nursing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical Wound Infection', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight Gain', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cost', 'critical care nursing', 'database query', 'early onset', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'indexing', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multilevel analysis', 'natural hypothermia', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonate', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prevent', 'repository', 'respiratory', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2021,48536
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart transplant (HTx) is a well-established life-saving procedure but is associated with severe complications. Current clinical monitoring algorithms rely on frequent invasive procedures including endomyocardial biopsies and catheter angiography. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed non-invasive comprehensive cardiac MRI, which can quantify regional changes in myocardial tissue and function. Our efforts have focused on the 2 major complications of HTx: 1) acute cardiac rejection (ACR), the leading cause of death in the first year after transplant; and 2) cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), the greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality beyond the first post-Tx year. Our cardiac MRI studies have identified new imaging biomarkers in HTx. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between abnormal cardiac MRI measures and potential allograft failure: myocardial T2 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as non-invasive tissue biomarkers for ACR. We demonstrated that the natural history of myocardial scarring, T2, and ECV predicts adverse clinical events in HTx recipients. In addition, our studies showed that donor and recipient mismatch (age, sex, weight, etc.) was significantly associated with cardiac MRI-derived measures of myocardial edema/inflammation, fibrosis, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Over the past five years, the PIs have assembled a unique study database with over >450 comprehensive cardiac MRI exams comprising >110,000 annotated cardiac MRI images. For this renewal application, we identified the need to conduct further long-term follow-up studies tailored to the slow disease progression in HTx to identify changes over time in multiparametric MRI measures and predictors of HTx outcome. Second, data on graft tissue and function in the pediatric HTx population are scarce and improved strategies for donor-recipient matching in this vulnerable population are needed to make most efficient use of the limited availability of donor hearts in children. Thus, cardiac MRI needs to better account for age and sex related differences in patient habitus and physiology, critical for the wide age range in HTx from pediatric to adult. The renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop multiparametric cardiac MRI for the assessment of graft tissue (T2, T1, ECV), and dysfunction (myocardial velocities, strain) from pediatric to adult, 2) leverage the existing large cardiac MRI database (110,000 labeled cardiac MRI images) to establish deep learning based analysis pipelines for automated cardiac MRI analysis with improved efficiency and reduced inter-rater variability, 3) to identify predictors of adverse outcomes and to evaluate the impact of donor-recipient mismatch on graft tissue, function, and flow in a prospective study with pediatric HTx patients, and 4) to identify cardiac metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) HTx patient outcome by leveraging our HTx database (>145 HTx recipients with existing baseline cardiac MRI acquired during the initial funding cycle). Follow-up cardiac MRI will provide unique insights in changes over time in graft tissue and function as mechanism underlying different HTx patient trajectories (non-progression vs. late onset vs. slow progression vs. fast progression). PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop multiparametric cardiac MRI and automated deep learning based cardiac MRI analysis workflows for improved assessment for complications after heart transplantation, the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage heart failure. Cardiac MRI will be developed to allow for efficient application from pediatric to adult patients in order to evaluate its diagnostic value for non-invasively detecting complications and to investigate the impact of differences in heart donor and recipient characteristics on the performance of the transplanted heart. In addition, we will leverage an existing large cardiac MRI database to allow for long-term 5-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management in heart transplant recipients.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,10208494,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Angiography', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease Progression', 'Donor Selection', 'Donor person', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Label', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Right Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplantation Surgery', 'Transplanted Heart Complication', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Ventricular', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost estimate', 'deep learning', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'graft failure', 'health care service utilization', 'heart allograft', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tissue biomarkers', 'transplant database', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,695340
"Cardiac photon counting CT and its application in studying interactions between Alzheimer's and heart disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aging is accompanied by increasing vulnerability to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The ongoing rise in both AD and CVD has been ascribed to the increasing adoption of a Western sedentary lifestyle accompanied by a diet rich in fats and sugars. To understand the links between AD and CVD in human subjects, non-invasive imaging methods such X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) are essential. Cardiac CT is one of the most powerful applications of these methodologies at both clinical and preclinical levels, but it is currently limited by its low contrast resolution. Our primary objective in this proposal is to improve the current status of cardiac CT based on photon counting detector technology and demonstrate its capabilities in preclinical studies focused on studying the interaction between CVD and AD. Our central hypothesis is that cardiac photon counting CT will provide low dose spectral characterization of atherosclerotic plaques together with cardiac function, while enabling longitudinal monitoring of interventions such as exercise. We will pursue three specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will develop the theoretical foundation and GPU optimized tools for reconstruction of cardiac 5D (3D + Time + Energy) photon counting CT data. We will incorporate deep learning solutions to overcome fundamental barriers to the advancement of this technology: regularization to deal with image noise associated with photon binning, robust material decomposition to combat spectral distortion, and automated cardiac function and plaque analysis to handle data dimensionality. During the second specific aim, we will characterize the performance of our novel cardiac photon counting CT imaging using simulations, phantoms and animal experiments to show its benefits for atherosclerotic plaque characterization and cardiac function estimation. Finally, in specific aim 3 we will investigate if cardiovascular risk impacts brain phenotypes in animal models of genetic risk for AD. CVD and AD share a genetic link via the ApoE gene and its isomorphic allele 4 (APOE4). We will use APOE3/HN and APOE4/HN mouse strains that express the corresponding specific targeted-replacement human APOE allele, on a humanized Nitric Oxide Synthase 2 (denoted here as HN) background. Using these models, we will first assess the impact of a high fat, high sugar diet on cardiovascular phenotypes (atherosclerotic plaque size, numbers; cardiac function measured with CT) and how these genetic differences are reflected in behavior and brain MR based biomarkers compared with control mice in the same background. Finally, we will also investigate the potential to rescue these phenotypes using exercise as the intervention. The impact of the proposed research will validate the usage of photon counting CT technology to enhance routine cardiac CT imaging applications. Our project will enable new powerful integrative approaches to examine the impact of environmental stressors to alter APOE genotype- specific vulnerability, or resilience to CVD and AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical, pathological and epidemiological evidence clearly show overlap between cardiovascular and Alzheimer’s diseases caused by a critical genetic link: the apolipoprotein E gene. We will develop novel photon counting cardiac CT imaging and use it in combination with brain MR imaging and behavior assessments to study the impact of APOE genotype in mouse models and to provide data on phenotypic differences in these mice when exposed to a high fat/high sugar diet and the role of exercise in protecting against Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular diseases.",Cardiac photon counting CT and its application in studying interactions between Alzheimer's and heart disease,10094804,RF1AG070149,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immune response', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'NOS2A gene', 'Names', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cardiac plaque', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'combat', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'environmental stressor', 'exercise intervention', 'exercise regimen', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mouse model', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'simulation', 'spectral distortion', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,RF1,2021,1873076
"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hemodialysis patients experience a disproportionately high burden of sudden cardiac death. Medication- provoked sudden cardiac death (i.e. death triggered by QT-prolonging medications) may be preventable and has not been studied enough in this population. Our project aims to uncover medication-related risk factors for sudden cardiac death and develop clinical decision support tools that will promote safer medication prescribing.",QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis,10127698,R01HL152034,"['Antibiotics', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antiemetics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biometry', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrolytes', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Hemodialysis', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medicare', 'Observational Study', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Prevention strategy', 'Publishing', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Safety', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Testing', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'implementation tool', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication safety', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'personalized decision', 'point of care', 'pragmatic trial', 'structural heart disease', 'sudden cardiac death', 'support tools']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,509050
"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross Cohort Collaboration ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), and its subtypes defined by preserved (HFpEF), reduced (HFrEF) or mid-range (HFmrEF) ejection fraction are a major and growing public health problem. The long term goal of this project is to better understand the health disparities regarding HF and define effective preventive measures that may reduce these disparities. We propose to pool data from 10 large longitudinal cohort studies to examine race/ethnic and sex disparities in developing HF, its subtypes, and its prognosis. The harmonized data will include over 130,028 men and women with over 8975 similarly-adjudicated prospective HF outcomes, representing a wide spectrum of ages, race/ethnicities, and geographic regions of the United States. This cross-cohort collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of sex and racial/ethnic health disparities in HF. Causal mediation analysis techniques will be used to estimate the degree to which single and multi-factor lifestyle and clinical interventions could potentially reduce health disparities in HF. In our phenomapping aim, we will define unique clinically relevant phenotypes of HF based upon cohort data that is also commonly present in medical records for enhanced generalizability, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, clinical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, ejection fraction, physiologic measures, and co-morbidities; we will also evaluate HF phenotype associations with CVD and all-cause mortality. NARRATIVE This Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross-Cohort Collaboration study will evaluate the magnitude and potential causes of racial/ethnic and sex disparities in incident heart failure and its subtypes and their prognosis in over 130,000 men and women from 10 pooled cohorts.

"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system. Our proposal will identify the factors contributing to these population differences in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage.",Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients,10114147,R01HL141892,"['Affect', 'Albumins', 'American', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'EFRAC', 'Event', 'Fibrinogen', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanics', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liver Failure', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Population', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Restrictive Cardiomyopathy', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Failure', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Update', 'Vibrissae', 'Waiting Lists', 'Woman', 'base', 'cardiac cachexia', 'cardiac device', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'forest', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'post-transplant', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'statistical and machine learning', 'time use', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant database', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2021,526607
"Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI Project Summary / Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million with a prevalence of 250,00-400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of HF is exercise (aerobic) therapy that has demonstrated various cardioprotective properties to halt and potentially reverse adverse structural remodeling. However, dosing of exercise therapy remains a challenge due to each individual's inherent differences and consequentially, serial non-invasive monitoring of the therapy would be necessary to evaluate the change on structural remodeling. Furthermore, current non-invasive technologies characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of exercise therapy in HF patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of exercise training to cardioprotect against HF by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with cardiac diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). DT-MRI is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current cardiac DT-MRI methods to be applied robustly in a clinical setting. In this project, an innovative 5-min “push button” DT-MRI method will be developed that overcomes such limitations. We also leverage institutional strengths to further quantify the accuracy of in vivo DT-MRI in revealing myocardial microstructure using novel tissue cleared 3D histology. The central hypothesis is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of cardiac DT-MRI to serve as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of HF on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted MRI. The proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-MRI methodology and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of exercise therapy on the microstructural remodeling of HF thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization of dosing exercise therapy. Project Narrative This project ultimately aims at optimizing the non-invasive monitoring of exercise therapy in heart failure patients to potentially improve outcome. The research strategy is designed to systematically develop an innovative cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that overcomes major shortcomings of the conventional methods and aims at immediate clinical translation. Successful completion of this project will result in a clinically robust cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that can effectively monitor the efficacy of exercise therapy and potentially improve treatment of heart failure.",Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI,10214689,R01HL151704,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Histology', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Pacemakers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'RNA marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Pathway', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Tachycardia', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'cardioprotection', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'denoising deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exercise training', 'functional loss', 'heart function', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'preservation', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'reconstruction', 'sedentary', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,673600
"Towards autonomous management of cardiogenic shock Project Summary  Physicians in the cardiac intensive care unit (CCU) make decisions in an increasingly data- and knowledge- rich world, yet often they get little help. Currently, each physician makes decisions based on his or her mental model of the patient’s physiology, together with mental predictions of the patient’s response to intervention. This approach can lead to a range of behaviors that compromise patient outcomes, including oversimplification of the physiology, errors due to cognitive overload, and physician to physician variability in decision making. A computational tool equipped with quantitative knowledge of physiology, the ability to systematically evaluate all the data, and informed by a database of past action-outcome events could aid the physician with valuable suggestions for action.  We propose to train an algorithm to make decisions about dosing vasoactive medications and initiating mechanical support in patients with cardiogenic shock due to decompensated heart failure. This focused set of decisions entails calculations about the physiology that are normally performed in a physician’s head. We frame the decision problem as optimizing cardiovascular function to preserve oxygen delivery, and we apply tools from optimal control. Rather than hand-design a CCU controller we will use reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to “fit” one. The field of RL has experienced explosive growth over the past few years, with notable advances in strategic decision problems and robotics. A key challenge in the clinical environment is that the exploration phase of learning (“trial and error”) would be unethical in real patients. A second challenge is that the availability of patient data, while growing, is likely to be a bottleneck. We will leverage state-of-the-art model-based RL to train an algorithm using a combination of simulation and off-policy learning from historical data. We will use a model of cardiovascular physiology that underlies cardiac simulators in use today for the training of cardiologists. Historical patient data will come from the Massachusetts General Hospital Clinical Data Animation Center which has recorded real-time telemetry waveform data in addition to standard electronic medical record data from all CCU patients spanning several years. This is one of the largest and most complete datasets of its kind. The complexity of managing cardiogenic shock will continue to escalate as tools become more sophisticated and patients live longer, with more extensive comorbidities. Advanced decision support tools could help tame this complexity, improving the quality of care as well as democratizing it. Project Narrative The sickest cardiac patients are treated in the intensive care unit and are complex to manage. We aim to create a tool that will use artificial intelligence to study a patient's data and offer a physician advice.

"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,10136697,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood pressure variability', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,172800
"High-throughput integrated live imaging and optogenetic pacing platform to assess hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart Project Summary Ischemic preconditioning is a well-established phenomenon, in which a brief episode(s) of controlled ischemia and reperfusion renders cardioprotection from a subsequent sustained episode of ischemia. An emerging body of evidence demonstrated that neural regulated heart rate modulation confers cardiac preconditioning responses. Understanding the mechanism through model systems of preconditioning would help us identify the genes and proteins when designing future drug targets for the prevention of ischemic cardiac injury. As a promising alternative to electrical pacing to modulate heart rate, optogenetic pacing does not require physical contact, has high spatial and temporal precision, offers more specific excitation, and avoids artifacts from electrical stimulation. Recent developments in the field of optogenetics make it possible for non-invasive and specific optical control of the heart rhythm in animal models, such as in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is a powerful genetic model system that has been used since the early 1900s to characterize genes associated with human diseases, including cardiac diseases. Studies performed in flies can provide insights into conserved mechanisms in cardiac diseases, which can be applied to higher organisms, including humans. Working in collaboration with Drs. Airong Li and Rudolph Tanzi from the Massachusetts General Hospital, we demonstrated non-invasive optogenetic pacing and concurrent optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the Drosophila heart for the first time. Recently, we further demonstrated red-light optogenetic pacing and successful optical control of tachycardia, bradycardia, and restorable cardiac arrest in fly models. Building on the decade-long productive collaboration with Drs. Li and Tanzi and new collaborations with Dr. Abhinav Diwan (cardiologist) and Dr. Jeanne Nerbonne (cardiac electrophysiologist) and Dr. Kenneth Schechtman (biostatistician) at Washington University, we propose to develop a high-throughput integrated OCT imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing system and establish a novel research platform to study preconditioning and hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart. We hypothesize that periods of bradypacing will precondition the fly heart to protect against hypoxia, via activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The specific aims are: 1) Develop and optimize a high-throughput integrated instrument for non-invasive OCT imaging and optogenetic control of fly heart function in vivo; 2) Develop double transgenic fly models and functional assays based on OCT imaging to characterize fly heart physiology in vivo; 3) Define functional and molecular changes in response to hypoxia and optogenetic preconditioning in transgenic fly models. If successful, the high-throughput optical imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing platform developed in this program combined with powerful double transgenic fly models will enable us to characterize changes of the fly heart function in response to different stress challenges that is not feasible before. This will allow us to perform a series of new experiments, providing insights into conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced cardiac changes and preconditioning. Project Narrative We will develop a novel research platform to noninvasively image and control heart function in fly models. Tachycardia, bradycardia and cardiac arrest will be stimulated using light and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning will be explored. The new knowledge and novel insights gleaned from these studies will advance our understanding of conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced changes in the heart and ischemic preconditioning.",High-throughput integrated live imaging and optogenetic pacing platform to assess hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart,10132500,R01HL156265,"['Abdomen', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Function Study', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Glean', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intelligence', 'Ion Channel', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Preconditioning', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Lysosomes', 'Massachusetts', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Opsin', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oranges', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Side', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tachycardia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'cardioprotection', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart rhythm', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'instrument', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'preconditioning', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,529434
"Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation PROJECT SUMMARY Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CM) are emerging as an invaluable in vitro human experimental platform for disease modeling, drug discovery, cardiotoxicity screening, gene editing and functional genomics. For the first time, cardiac electrophysiology has access to a scalable human experimental model, which, currently, offers the only path to personalized (cardiac) medicine as patient-derived iPS-CMs can be generated on a progressively faster time scale. The clear potential of this technology motivates efforts to address the main criticisms facing iPS-CMs, namely the need for further maturation and reduction of phenotype heterogeneity. As multiple approaches are being pursued to improve iPS-CM maturation and to approximate the functionality of the adult human myocardium, we argue that combinatorial optimizations necessitate new high-throughput (HT) technology and automation. The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate a scalable platform for optimizing cardiac tissue engineering via chronic reconfigurable optical pacing and “on-demand” oxygenation for gaining mechanistic insights into cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology, a platform we call ChROME. Chronic electrical stimulation is a viable lead to iPS-CM maturation, yet it has remained under-explored, specifically as related to the role of mass transport and oxygenation during such stimulation. Leveraging our expertise in the theoretical and experimental use of optogenetic tools for cardiac applications (Entcheva) and automation (Kostov, Li, Entcheva, Kay), we propose to design and validate the first-generation HT-ChROME platform, that will integrate continuous monitoring of key physiological parameters. Our team’s expertise in optical oxygen sensing (Kostov), in-house manufacturing of “on-demand” oxygenation nanocarriers (perfluorocarbons, PFC) (Kay) and metabolic characterization (Kay, Beard) will be applied to address the increased metabolic demands during stimulation. The ability to quantify “functional maturation” by relevant measures (voltage, calcium, contraction) in a high-throughput manner (Entcheva) in 2D and 3D cardiac tissue constructs (Vunjak-Novakovic), using our automated platform OptoDyCE (all-optical dynamic cardiac electrophysiology) is critical in this undertaking. Employing these HT tools and other imaging and omics modalities (Popratiloff, Horvath), we will elucidate the spectrum of responses triggered by chronic stimulation of iPS-CMs: beneficial/maturation effects vs. pathological overload effects, depending on load and oxygenation conditions. The proposed HT-ChROME platform represents a critical step in resolving issues impeding progress with iPS-CMs to accelerate their wide-spread adoption in basic and translational applications. The obtained large-scale data will inform a new generation of biophysical models linking human cardiac metabolism and electrophysiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent advances in stem-cell technology enable patient-derived cells to be turned into functional heart cells, and this is an exciting direction towards personalized medicine; yet, there are many challenges in optimizing these cardiomyocytes to better mimic the real heart – a problem that the proposed engineering tools will help resolve.",Scalable platform for optimizing human cardiac tissue engineering via optical pacing and on-demand oxygenation,10093123,R01HL144157,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Automation', 'Biological', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Data', 'Disease model', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Experimental Models', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Human Engineering', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mitochondria', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'NADH', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Regression Analysis', 'Role', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biophysical model', 'cardiac tissue engineering', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'functional genomics', 'heart cell', 'heart metabolism', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanocarrier', 'optogenetics', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'stem cell technology', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'voltage']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,621465
"Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract Shear Stress and Light-Field to Elucidate the Initiation of Cardiac Outflow Tract Biomechanical forces modulate cardiac morphogenesis, and mutations in mechano-sensitive signaling pathways result in congenital heart defects. During the previous funding cycle, our team custom-built a Light- Sheet Fluorescence Microscopy (LSFM) with sub-voxel resolution to enhance axial resolution needed to provide a large field-of-view. This laser optical system allowed for imaging pulsatile vs. oscillatory shear stress- mediated Notch signaling to initiate endocardial trabeculation. We demonstrated that spatial (/x) and temporal (/t) variations in shear stress modulates Notch-EphrinB2-Neureguilin-1 signaling in the endocardium to activate erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase (ErbB2) that promotes proliferation of trabeculation. By integrating LSFM, computation, and transgenic models, we further established that trabeculation dissipates intracardiac shear stress-generated kinetic energy; thus, mitigating ventricular remodeling. However, it remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced myocardial contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis. Thus, we seek to integrate light-sheet (Bessel-Gaussian beam arrays) with a new 2) light-field (microlens array). The former provides non-diffracting illumination, and the latter provides volumetric detection as a paradigm shift to image both myocardial contractility and intracardiac flow dynamics in the outflow tract (OFT). Our preliminary study reveals that shear-mediated Notch1b expression in the endocardium of OFT regulates endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT); however, the mechanotransduction causation whereby myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress reciprocally interact to form bicuspid valves and subsequent remodeling to multi-cuspid valves remains elusive. Thus, our hypothesis is that integration of the new light-field system with imaging computation enhances spatiotemporal resolution needed to decouple myocardial contraction from intracardiac flow dynamics that modulates Notch1b-EndoMT to mediate valve morphogenesis in the OFT. In Aim 1, we plan to integrate light-sheet with the new light-field system for 4-D volumetric imaging of valve formation in the OFT. Our goal is to capture myocardial contractility and intracardiac shear stress at one snapshot. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate the interaction between intracardiac shear stress and myocardial contractility underlying valve morphogenesis. Our goal is to decouple hemodynamic shear from contractile forces that mediate Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. In Aim 3, we will determine the relative role of shear stress and contractility underlying Notch1b-mediated EndoMT. Our goal is to elucidate the relative role of contractility and intracardiac stress to transmit Notch1b- EndoMT signaling underlying bicuspid-valve formation. Overall, our team aims to establish the micro- environment in which intracardiac flow dynamics and myocardial contractility interact to modulate OFT valve formation, with clinical significance to aortic valvular disease. Project Narrative Cardiac outflow tract (OFT) defects, including aortic valves and the greater arteries, are estimated to cause approximately 30% of these congenital heart diseases, and they are treated with surgical correction and/or replacement. It remains unclear what would be the consequences of reduced cardiac contractility or altered intracardiac flow dynamics on valve morphogenesis, including aortic stenosis, bicuspid or tricuspid aortic valves. To understand the mechanotransduction causation downstream of blood flow and shear stress sensing, we have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to integrate advanced laser optics, imaging computation, and genetic models to decouple intracardiac flow dynamics from myocardial contractility that modulates Notch1b-mediated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) with translational implication to aortic valve disease.",Shear stress and light-field to elucidate the initiation of cardiac outflow tract,10146767,R01HL129727,"['4D Imaging', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Arteries', 'Bicuspid', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Computer Models', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Coupled', 'Cuspid', 'Custom', 'Data Reporting', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Endocardium', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Lasers', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mesenchymal', 'Microscopy', 'Mitral Valve', 'Morphogenesis', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Contraction', 'Neuregulin 1', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Model', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'aortic valve', 'aortic valve disorder', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'erbB-2 Receptor', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging Segmentation', 'mechanotransduction', 'multidisciplinary', 'notch protein', 'optical imaging', 'response', 'shear stress', 'simulation', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,459651
"Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed study is motivated by the public health importance of aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of valvular heart disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Once symptomatic, survival is a dismal 50% at 1-year if left untreated. Clinical symptoms develop once cardiac compensatory mechanisms fail, indicating the need for aortic valve replacement (AVR), but because AS primarily affects the elderly, symptoms are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions, advanced age, or both—resulting in delayed treatment. While most patients that eventually undergo AVR experience improvements in symptoms and survival, nearly half of patients die within the first year after AVR or fail to reap the symptom and health status improvements for which they underwent AVR. Our research suggests that irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury related to delayed treatment contribute to these poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the unmet need for objective and sensitive measures to inform clinical decisions regarding the timing of AVR. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement an omics-based precision medicine approach for identifying patients with severe AS at-risk for irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury who would benefit from earlier AVR, and our central hypothesis is that multi-omic signatures reflective of dimensions of cardiac structure and function will identify irreversible cardiac remodeling and therefore predict the clinical response to AVR. Our prior work and preliminary studies provide strong support for our hypothesis and demonstrate that our experienced multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete the proposed study. We have identified metabolomic signatures that relate strongly to measures of cardiac function and structure and predict mortality after AVR, and also proteomic signatures relating to cardiac function that differentiate severe AS and associate with mortality. Within this proposal, we adopt a longitudinal systems biology approach that leverages the latest in proteomic and metabolomic (multi-omic) sciences to: discover, test, and cross-validate multi-omic signatures of cardiac function and structure in patients with severe AS (Aim 1); characterize longitudinal multi-omic signatures and associations with changes in cardiac structure and function after AVR (Aim 2); and evaluate the accuracy with which multi-omic signatures predict response to AVR (Aim 3). Our approach will enable us to identify multi-omic signatures of irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury in patients with severe AS. These data will support the development of new precision medicine-based strategies for identifying patients who would benefit from earlier clinical intervention in an effort to reduce mortality and maximize health after AVR. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aortic stenosis ultimately leads to heart failure and death, but valve replacement is curative. For many patients, valve replacement is performed too late, after damage to the heart muscle is no longer reversible, resulting in persistent symptoms and increased risk for death. The goal of my research is to identify compounds within the blood that can serve as an early warning that the heart is struggling to overcome aortic stenosis and can therefore help physicians plan the optimal timing of valve replacement surgery.",Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart,10127697,R01HL151838,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'EFRAC', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heart', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'aortic valve replacement', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'patient registry', 'persistent symptom', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive signature', 'pressure', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,665495
"Optical Tools to Assess the Role of Cardiac Function in the Development of Congenital Heart Defects Project Summary We and others have shown that altered hemodynamics and shear stress can lead to congenital heart defects (CHDs), but still there is limited information on how these forces affect molecular signaling. Studying the impact of abnormal hemodynamics and shear stress becomes even more urgent when we consider that perturbed blood flow may be a contributing factor to a large percentage of CHDs regardless of whether the initial trigger is environmental or genetic. Although our group and others have recently developed extremely useful optical imaging tools (e.g., optical coherence tomography – OCT) to assess hemodynamics and shear stress, and connected these measurements to CHDs, it has been difficult to link shear stress with the affected molecular pathways. Our group and others have performed qPCR experiments on control and shear-stress perturbed hearts to see how abnormal hemodynamics alters gene expression. However, this approach requires the entire embryonic heart for one measurement, missing all spatial and cell-type information, particularly at the endocardial layer. In order to successfully assess how shear stress affects molecular signaling throughout the looping heart, we need to improve upon our OCT methods, develop 3D methods for assessing embryonic heart gene expression, and create an advanced image processing pipeline to analyze data and relate regional shear stress to gene expression.  This renewal proposal will continue our work developing tools that can lead to a more sophisticated understanding of how cardiac function (e.g., hemodynamics and electrical impulse conduction) affects heart development, enabling potential therapies to avoid or mitigate CHDs. In this proposal, we will focus on developing tools to understand how oscillatory shear stress (quantified as oscillatory shear index - OSI) influences gene expression and leads to CHDs. In our preliminary studies, we increased regurgitant blood flow (causing increased OSI) to show that alterations to OSI leads to smaller cardiac cushions (valve precursors) and ultimately, to CHDs. Increased regurgitant blood flow and smaller cushions is present in our two disease models (fetal alcohol spectrum disorders – FASD; velo-cardio-facial syndrome/Digeorge) and our FASD prevention compounds partially normalize blood flow, cardiac cushion size, and greatly reduce morbidity and CHDs.  Our specific aims include 1) advance our OCT system and shear stress analysis, 2) develop fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) protocols to measure gene expression in 3D, 3) develop an image processing pipeline to relate gene expression to shear stress, and 4) determine the impact of shear stress on gene expression. Upon completion, we will have significantly more information on how shear stress affects molecular expression. With this knowledge, we will be better equipped to determine which molecular pathways are most influenced by altered hemodynamics, to develop earlier detection methods and potentially develop strategies to prevent CHDs more effectively. Project Narrative Abnormal blood flow has been shown to play a role in the formation of congenital heart defects (CHDs). However, few tools exist to study how forces exerted by blood flow early in heart development result in altered molecular signaling. Our proposal centers on creating optical imaging to investigate mechanical stresses experienced by cells lining the beating, early-stage heart tube and how these cells and adjacent tissues respond in gene expression in each area of the heart during normal, diseased, and rescued conditions.",Optical Tools to Assess the Role of Cardiac Function in the Development of Congenital Heart Defects,10211096,R01HL126747,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Betaine', 'Biological Process', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Heart', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Glutathione', 'Heart', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quail', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sequencing By Hybridizations', 'Shprintzen syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tube', 'Work', 'addiction', 'cardiogenesis', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'detection method', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'heart function', 'hemodynamics', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in situ sequencing', 'indexing', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'statistics', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,767418
"Association of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Cardiac Electrical Instability: A Twin Study ABSTRACT Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), but unfortunately not studied very well. This may in part be is due to the fact that many SCDs are unwitnessed, which makes the study of SCD triggers difficult. As a possible solution to this problem, we propose to study electrocardiographic (ECG) markers of cardiac electrical instability in a cohort of 1,000 Veteran male twins who are recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Dr. Shah is an Early Stage Investigator who is poised to lead this effort that follows from his previous work on arrhythmia risk due to acute mental stress (K23 HL127251). His team includes several established investigators in the field of PTSD and heart disease (Viola Vaccarino, Douglas Bremner), stress and arrhythmia (Rachel Lampert), and signal processing/mobile health technologies (Gari Clifford, Larry Jamner). Dr. Shah, over the past several years, has worked closely with the Vietnam veteran twins and is an experienced investigator with this cohort. They have generated important preliminary data that demonstrates a potential relationship between PTSD and TWA; in addition, they have demonstrated feasibility of studying Veterans continuously for one week in their currently funded study which measures PTSD, autonomic function, and sleep. Dr. Shah is also leading telehealth efforts at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which has provided important methodologies for the current study to recruit and enroll participants from around the United States remotely. The first aim seeks to evaluate the relationship of PTSD symptoms and cardiac electrical instability using two ECG-based markers for arrhythmia: microvolt T-wave alternans (TWA) and morphological beat variability (MVB). Both are expected to be associated with higher PTSD symptoms, suggesting an acutely increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The relationship is also hypothesized to be moderated by genetic factors: when adjusting for genetic factors by evaluating monozygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD, the relationship is attenuated. Aim 2 examines the relationship between everyday PTSD symptoms with an ecological momentary assessment and MVB/TWA. We hypothesize that acute increases in PTSD symptoms and stress also increase cardiac electrical instability, measured by higher TWA and MVB. Finally, aim 3 explores fragmented sleep and other behavioral correlates of PTSD as possible mechanisms through which PTSD may indirectly impact SCD risk through modifiable behaviors. Our hypothesis is that sleep fragmentation and other maladaptive behaviors such as low physical activity will result higher TWA/MVB on a daily basis. Overall, Dr. Shah is a poised and well-equipped to carry out this large project with novel methods and unprecedented reach in terms of impact and  Project Narrative Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death and can cause cardiac electrical instability. This study aims to address the reasons behind sudden cardiac death by evaluating the relationship of cardiac electrical instability with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We will also study the way in which PTSD-related genes, sleep disturbance, and physical inactivity may also play a role in its potential relationship with cardiac electrical risk.",Association of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Cardiac Electrical Instability: A Twin Study,10299148,R01HL155711,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Acute Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Address', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Attenuated', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health Technology', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Fragmentations', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Ventricular', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Viola', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biobehavior', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'male', 'men', 'modifiable behavior', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'poor sleep', 'prospective', 'psychological trauma', 'recruit', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'sleep behavior', 'stress related disorder', 'sudden cardiac death', 'telehealth', 'traumatic stress', 'virtual']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,741461
"Alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair in human induced pluripotent stem cell model PROJECT SUMMARY Alcohol exposure is a key risk factor for abnormal heart development and contributes to congenital heart disease, the leading non-infectious cause of infant mortality. Alcohol-induced impaired heart growth and development in early life can also increase the risk of heart disease later in adulthood. Furthermore, adult cardiac system is also sensitive to alcohol exposure, which is an important but underappreciated risk factor contributing to heart disease. Alcohol exposure is associated with ischemic events, arrhythmias and alterations in cardiac function and structure. These pathological consequences could result from complex actions of alcohol including increased cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and abnormal Ca2+ handling. Inflammatory cytokines produced by alcohol exposure could also contribute to alcohol-induced heart injury. However, mechanisms underlying alcohol- induced heart disease are not fully defined and effective therapies are lacking. Traditionally, studies on alcohol exposure have relied on animal models and cells because of limited availability and growth capacity of human primary cardiomyocytes. However, studies in animal models are time consuming, expensive, and not amenable for high-throughput drug screening, and have limitations due to physiological differences from humans. To complement the studies on animal models and cells, we have recently explored the use of cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) as a novel and physiologically relevant model to study alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity. hiPSC-CMs have many features similar to human primary CMs, can be engineered into tissue-like structures and maintained in long-term cultures, and can be adapted for high-throughput platforms. We have demonstrated that exposure of hiPSC-CMs with clinically relevant doses of alcohol can recapitulate pathological events caused by alcohol exposure, including oxidative stress, altered gene expression and cardiac dysfunction as indicated by abnormal Ca2+ handling and contractility. We have adapted hiPSC-CMs into high- throughput formats and established high-throughput assays to detect alcohol-induced cardiotoxicity and screen for cardiac proliferative/protective agents. Using this in vitro human cell model and state-of-the-art high- throughput technologies, we propose to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms of alcohol-induced toxicity in human cardiomyocytes and evaluate potential therapies to mitigate alcohol-induced cytotoxicity. In addition, we plan to investigate the involvement of inflammatory cytokines in alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair. We expect that our established hiPSC-CM model will help understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying alcohol toxicity in human cardiomyocytes and accelerate the development of targeted and effective therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prenatal alcohol exposure is a key factor contributing to abnormal heart development and is associated with various cardiac anomalies with serious long-term complications in adulthood. This study aims to discover novel molecular mechanisms and potential therapies to control the detrimental effect of alcohol exposure on cellular and functional properties of heart cells using human stem cell model.",Alcohol-induced cardiac injury and repair in human induced pluripotent stem cell model,10209255,R01AA028527,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Arrhythmia Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Apoptosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'CXCL12 gene', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cell Death', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Embryonic Development', 'Engineering', 'Ethanol', 'Ethanol toxicity', 'Event', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Growth and Development function', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Injuries', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Ion Channel', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural regeneration', 'Organ', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathologic', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Response Elements', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'RyR2', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cell-Derived Factor 1', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Woman', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'appropriate dose', 'cardiogenesis', 'clinically relevant', 'congenital heart disorder', 'cytokine', 'cytotoxicity', 'effective therapy', 'heart cell', 'heart disease risk', 'heart function', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'human pluripotent stem cell', 'human stem cells', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'injury and repair', 'interest', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'nuclear factor-erythroid 2', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'stem cell model', 'stem cells', 'targeted treatment', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAAA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,351750
"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,10218258,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,646449
"Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis ABSTRACT Heart failure imposes a tremendous burden of morbidity and mortality, costing the United States in excess of $31 billion annually. An increasingly recognized major determinant of outcomes in heart failure is right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. However, the nature and character of RV contribution to cardiovascular outcomes remains poorly understood, largely due to the imprecision of imaging and interpretation of RV morphology and function. Echocardiography, with its high temporal resolution and low cost of acquisition, serves as frontline cardiovascular imaging and a mainstay in approaches to assessing RV morphology and function. However, echocardiographic imaging of the RV is limited by factors that include technical variation in image acquisition and heterogeneity in image assessment as well as overall interpretation. We postulate that deep learning based phenotyping can offer the ability to not only more precisely characterize RV function but also classify RV imaging phenotypes according to etiologic disease states and, even further, refine prognostic evaluations of future cardiovascular risk. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use video-based deep learning segmentation models to assess RV function, evaluate its cross-sectional relation with a range of expert-measured parameters, and examine its variation in the context of patient characteristics derived from large hospital-based cohorts. In Aim 2, we will use video-based deep learning models to produce imaging-based classification of RV disease and assess the ability of unsupervised approaches to classify RV dysfunction into various categories of disease etiology. In Aim 3, we will use models developed in part from training in Aims 1 and 2 to predict major cardiovascular outcomes including heart failure in addition to coronary artery disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death in both hospital- based and community-based cohorts. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve the precision and standardization of RV phenotyping and determine the extent to which deep learning models can augment human assessment of the RV. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development program designed to provide the candidate with the skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist in cardiovascular medicine and translational imaging science. An advisory committee of established scientists/mentors in the fields of cardiac imaging, deep learning, data science, and translational science will guide the candidate in his transition to scientific independence over the course of the award period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Heart failure imposes a tremendous morbidity and mortality burden, costing the U.S. healthcare system over $31 billion per year. An under-recognized and yet important contributor to heart failure outcomes is right ventricular dysfunction, which remains understudied due to technical issues that have historically challenged conventional approaches to cardiovascular imaging. We will examine how deep learning models can precisely evaluate right ventricular function – and enable earlier, more accurate assessments of its contributions to cardiovascular risk.","Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis",10185865,K99HL157421,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia', 'Award', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dissection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Program Development', 'Prospective cohort', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Right Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Right Ventricular Function', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'hands on research', 'healthcare community', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'study population', 'success', 'temporal measurement']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,154780
"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,10080366,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2021,161047
"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk.

"Cardiac MR-Based Risk Stratification for Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in HCM Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease, affecting as many as 1:200 individuals in the general population. HCM, initially described in the context of sudden cardiac death (SCD), is commonly associated with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Rigorous research over the past two decades has enabled us to identify HCM patients at the greatest risk of SCD who could benefit from a prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With advances in SCD prevention, HCM management has now shifted its focus to HF and AF. Nearly 50% of HCM patients have mild to severe HF symptoms. HF is now considered the most common cause of HCM-related mortality. AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia, occurring in nearly 25% of HCM patients, and responsible for a decreased quality of life and increased stroke risk. Currently, we are not able to predict which HCM patients are more likely to progress toward end-stage HF or develop AF. Cardiovascular imaging using echocardiography and cardiac MR has played a central role in our evolving understanding of HCM. Echocardiography provides a robust assessment of left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction and diastolic dysfunction. With its high spatial resolution and remarkable tissue characterization capabilities, cardiac MR has emerged as an imaging modality well suited to characterize the HCM phenotype. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel risk stratification paradigms by leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve HCM patient management. We will investigate a deep learning (DL) risk model for prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes that incorporates (a) standard clinical and imaging parameters and (b) novel cardiac MR signatures extracted using (i) radiomic analysis (i.e. a computational method to automatically extract and select clinically significant imaging markers) or (ii) deep imaging signatures, extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The performance of these models will be rigorously evaluated using 3 HCM cohorts collected at Tufts Medical Center, BIDMC, and University of Toronto.

"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10171903,R01HL153447,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Echocardiography', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'High Prevalence', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mission', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Mitral Valve Prolapse', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Prevention', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Screening procedure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,779765
"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10215611,R44HL144297,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Auscultation', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Eko', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart murmur', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cloud software', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound', 'underserved area']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2021,920184
"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10234187,R01HL127661,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Selection Criteria', 'Speed', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'base', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,735785
"Evaluating and Improving Utilization of Evidence-Based Medical Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure using Automated Tools in the Electronic Health Record PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) affects over 6 million US adults, with high rates of hospitalization and nearly 50% mortality at 5 years from diagnosis. Nearly half of these patients have systolic HF with multiple evidence-based therapeutic options proven to reduce the risk of hospitalization and mortality in this subgroup of patients. Evaluating the appropriate utilization of these therapies is currently limited to post-hoc assessments of manually abstracted patient records at a limited number of hospitals participating in quality improvement registries. These manual abstraction strategies do not offer opportunities to improve care in real-time, and even at hospitals engaged in quality improvement efforts, only 1 in 5 of eligible patients with HF receive all first-line evidence based medical treatments. In this patient-oriented mentored career development award proposal, Dr. Rohan Khera proposes to leverage the ubiquitous digitization of medical records in the electronic health record (EHR) to address the adequate utilization of evidence based medical therapy in HF. He proposes to use a large, publicly accessible, deidentified EHR database to develop and validate an algorithm that uses deep learning based natural language processing (NLP) within unstructured clinical documentation for hospitalized HF patients to identify those with systolic HF (Aim #1). He will engage clinicians to design consensus-based algorithms to identify contraindications to HF treatments, developed as algorithms within the EHR (Aim #2). Finally, he will construct a prototypic clinical decision support (CDS) tool identifying HF treatment eligibility in real-time using the algorithms and evaluate potential implementation strategies using qualitative evaluation of feedback from clinicians and patients (Aim #3). While proposed as a strategy to evaluate quality of care of individual patients, the proposed research will also model a fully automated electronic clinical quality measure for HF. The algorithms will be made open source to allow institutions to validate and apply them to their individual care setting. The proposal is supported by strong mentorship from experts in quality measure design, informatics, advanced NLP, CDS design, and qualitative research methodology. The facilities at Yale Center of Outcomes Research and Evaluation, which designs and evaluates national quality measures, and has access to computational resources required to accomplish the research goals as well as to the Yale EHR to validate the models are major strengths of the application. The proposed period of mentored research will support Dr. Khera’s training in medical informatics, advanced analytic tools such as NLP, and qualitative research methodology. The experience and skillset acquired during this period will support Dr. Khera’s transition to independence where he plans to lead multi-institutional collaboratives to evaluate the use of automated tools in the measurement and improvement of the quality of medical care in HF. The career development plan that accompanies the proposal is designed to support Dr. Khera’s long-term career goal to be a national leader in the design and implementation of informatics- based approaches of delivering high quality, patient-centered, cardiovascular care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The scope of quality improvement programs that focus on improving the utilization of first-line evidence-based medical therapies in patients with heart failure is limited by mechanisms to identify those who are eligible for specific treatments. The current proposal aims to design automated tools to identify patients eligible for heart failure therapies using various data components already captured in the electronic health record in hospitalized patients. The proposal will then pilot test strategies of improving treatment utilization with electronic alerts delivered to clinicians based on these tools.",Evaluating and Improving Utilization of Evidence-Based Medical Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure using Automated Tools in the Electronic Health Record,10214973,K23HL153775,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adrenergic beta-Antagonists', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Angiotensins', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Automation', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Coughing', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Low Cardiac Output', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mineralocorticoid Receptor', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neprilysin', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical tool', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'hospitalization rates', 'hyperkalemia', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'open source', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tool']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193510
"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,10213130,R01HL148248,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical conference', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'heart disease risk', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke model', 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolic stroke']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,673978
"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,10110023,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Country', 'Cox Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'International', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse event risk', 'attenuation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic', 'radiotracer', 'relating to nervous system', 'risk prediction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,777637
"In silico safety pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY: A major factor plaguing drug development is that there is no drug-screening tool that can distinguish between drugs that will induce cardiac arrhythmias from chemically similar safe drugs. The current approaches rely on substitute markers such as action potential duration or QT interval prolongation on the ECG. There is an urgent need to identify a new approach that can predict actual proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry rather than relying on surrogate indicators. We have brought together an expert team to innovate at the interfaces of experimental and computational modeling disciplines and develop an in silico simulation pipeline to predict cardiotoxicity over multiple temporal and spatial scales from the atom to the cardiac rhythm. An essential and unique aspect of our approach is that we propose to utilize atomistic scale simulation to predict the transition rates of ion channels and adrenergic receptors and how they are modified by drug interaction. We hypothesize that it is the subtleties of these interactions that are likely to be the critical determinants of drug associated safety or proarrhythmia. In the last award period, we successfully developed an unprecedented linkage: We connected the highly disparate space and time scales of ion channel structure and function. We utilized atomistic simulation to compute drug kinetic rates were directly used as parameters in a hERG function model. The model components were then integrated into predictive models at the cell and tissue scales to expose fundamental arrhythmia vulnerability mechanisms and complex interactions underlying emergent behaviors. Human clinical data were used for model validation and showed excellent agreement, demonstrating feasibility of this new approach for cardiotoxicity prediction. In this renewal application we propose to hugely extend this approach to include prediction of the interaction of cardiac channel gating and drug interaction as well as the inclusion of adrenergic receptor interactions with drugs. Another essential aspect of safety pharmacology is the development of new approaches to allow more efficient drug design, screening and prediction of cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we will seek to develop, extend and apply a variety of machine learning and deep learning approaches to improve drug discovery by predicting proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry with an efficient process that identify drug congeners via machine learning to maximize therapy and minimize side effects. Finally, we propose to classify drugs into categories based on proarrhythmia risk in normal and diseased virtual tissue settings. The multiscale model for prediction of cardiopharmacology that we will develop in this application will be applied to projects demonstrating its usefulness for efficacy or toxicity of drug treatments in the complex physiological system of the heart. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Cardiotoxicity in the form of deadly abnormal rhythms is one of the most common and dangerous risks for drugs in development. There is an urgent need for new approaches to accurately screen and predict the effects of drugs on cardiac rhythms.

"Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home Abstract Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause for both hospitalizations and readmissions in the Medicare program. HF’s high mortality rate and high hospitalization utilization rate via readmissions results in a large economic burden currently estimated at over $30B, and prevalence of HF is expected to continue rising by 46% by 2030. There is an opportunity to deploy remote patient monitoring (RPM) tools for measuring prognostic biomarkers of worsening HF and acute decompensation and hospital readmission. Bender Tech (BT) has developed a urine testing platform capable of easily attaching to a home-toilet for accurate and easy collection of longitudinal health and behavior data without the requirement of manual sample collection and/or testing. We propose to adapt our system for use in elderly HF patient populations by rendering data collection and transmission completely passive. We propose to integrate sensors and firmware capable of identifying when a user has used their home toilet (Specific Aim 1), develop the machine learning (ML) classification algorithms necessary for determining when to perform a testing sequence (Specific Aim 2), and use ML methods to demonstrate feasibility of user biometric identification via urinary testing data (Specific Aim 3). A successful outcome of this proposal will be a set of classification models built using ML techniques designed to enable passive collection of longitudinal urine profile data from a home-toilet for use in remotely managing elderly HF patients. This will ready the product for prospective clinical trials that would be the subject of a future phase II submission for use in remotely monitoring diuretic effectiveness and preventing hospital readmissions. Project Narrative Remotely stratifying risk of worsening heart failure and predicting imminent decompensation and hospitalizations using remote patient monitoring devices can help lower healthcare costs and improve lives for the elderly living with heart failure at home. Longitudinal urinary trend data of physiologically important markers, such as spot sodium tests, have been shown to help classify potentially stable heart failure patients, predict acute decompensation, and measure diuretic effectiveness via relative changes from baseline measurements. Bender Tech proposes to integrate the hardware and machine learning methods necessary to render its internet- connected home urine testing platform completely passive to enable use by the elderly HF population and obviate any need for device interaction for data collection and transmission.","Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home",10187779,R43HL157937,"['Acute', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Defecation', 'Devices', 'Diuretics', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Sodium', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Failure', 'Urination', 'Urine', 'Use Effectiveness', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'health data', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'risk stratification', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tool', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning', 'urinary']",NHLBI,"BENDER TECH, LLC",R43,2021,224996
"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,10165813,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'risk prediction']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,684863
"Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning PROJECT ABSTRACT Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over 250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent. In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315 adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML, simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01- level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Heart transplantation is a potentially life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure but unfortunately donors are scarce and only a fortunate minority of patients receive hearts. Current heart allocation policy relies on the intensity of treatment to decide who receives a heart, but this system cannot consistently identify the sickest candidates who stand to benefit the most from heart transplantation. This proposal aims to improve heart allocation by 1) developing a data-driven, objective heart allocation score with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and 2) building novel, more flexible simulation software.",Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning,10088470,K08HL150291,"['Adult', 'American', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'organ allocation', 'organ procurement transplantation network', 'post-transplant', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'risk stratification', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'skills', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2021,157896
"Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Mutations in the Transthyretin (TTR) gene can lead to deposition of abnormal amyloid fibrils in the myocardium, resulting in hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) and leading to heart failure. Targeted therapies for hATTR-CM have recently been developed and have shown to improve mortality and hospitalization.  Recently, we led a study (Journal of American Medical Association, Dec 2019) that showed that the TTR V122I mutation, commonly observed in racial/ethnic minorities (4% in African Americans (AAs) and 1% in Hispanic Americans (HAs)), confers two-fold increased risk of heart failure. Despite this strong effect, only 11% of V122I carriers with heart failure were appropriately diagnosed with hATTR-CM, suggesting marked underdiagnosis and mis-diagnosis of the disease. We further showed subclinical evidence of echocardiographic derangements in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers, suggesting early signs can occur well before onset of disease.  We propose to extend our prior work by addressing knowledge gaps which are necessary for targeted therapies to attain their full potential. These include: understanding the incomplete penetrance of V122I; identifying V122I carriers in large health care systems where genotyping is not common; and understanding subclinical disease burden. In Aim 1, we will examine the interplay between a polygenic risk score, which are comprised of millions of single nucleotide variants with small effects, and V122I, a monogenic mutation with a single strong effect, analyzed in conjunction with clinical risk factors on heart failure in in 6,609 AAs and 9,006 HAs in the BioMe biobank and 5,833 AAs in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). In Aim 2, we will apply machine learning tools to multi-modal electronic health record (EHR) data to identify V122I carriers in ~8 million patients from an electronic health record (EHR) data repository at Mount Sinai. In Aim 3, we will evaluate subclinical effects of amyloid deposition on cardiac structural/functional traits in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers by recalling V122I carriers for imaging evaluation including research-grade echocardiograms, cardiac magnetic resonance and technetium nuclear scanning.  The proposal is innovative because we are utilizing two large diverse ancestry EHR-linked biobanks from academic health systems (BioMe at Mount Sinai, and PMBB at University of Pennsylvania), along with adopting cutting-edge methods including multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores, and machine learning approaches on multi-modal EHR data. We further propose patient recall based on genotypes and perform deep phenotyping using comprehensive heart imaging scans.  This proposal has the potential to realize the potential of precision medicine for heart failure in racial/ethnic minorities by informing clinical care, population management, risk stratification and clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Transthyretin V122I, is a highly penetrant mutation for hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) that is common in African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Recent therapies have been approved to treat hATTR-CM, which have led to decreased mortality; thus, understanding who will develop hATTR-CM, accurate identification of V122I carriers and understanding hidden disease burden is important. In this proposal, we examine the population health impact of V122I using polygenic risk scores, machine learning approaches on electronic health records, and patient recall by genotype, which can lead to new population health strategies for heart failure in racial and ethnic minorities.","Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals",10101075,R01HL155915,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'African', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Medical Association', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caribbean Hispanic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diphosphates', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Onset of illness', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prealbumin', 'Quality of life', 'Recontacts', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supportive care', 'Technetium', 'Technetium 99m', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'data repository', 'disease diagnosis', 'ethnic minority population', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'polygenic risk score', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'risk stratification', 'scale up', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,770230
"Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), characterized by heart failure symptoms with normal ejection fraction, is highly prevalent. However, most HFpEF patients do not respond to standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and there are no clear and uniform diagnostic criteria to stratify and differentiate HFpEF from HFrEF. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need for us to better understand HFpEF at the molecular and system levels. Unbiased approaches such as machine learning (ML) offer a powerful means to tease out the molecular signatures of HFpEF in relevant disease models. The emerging evidence implicates that metabolism and redox homeostasis are two significant disruptions in cellular processes evidenced by clinical symptoms of HFpEF. Previous studies have identified branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic defect as another major metabolic hallmark in heart failure as well as in metabolic disorders. Moreover, BCAA catabolic defects have been demonstrated to directly impact mitochondrial function and elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in oxidative stress-sensitive post-translational modifications (O-PTMs) that govern protein function and pathways. These exciting discoveries lead to our new hypothesis that O-PTM-mediated proteome remodeling is a dynamic and pervasive molecular change in diseased hearts, affecting proteins with central function in cardiac homeostasis and pathophysiology. To investigate the unique molecular features and pathogenic mechanisms of HFpEF, we highlight a novel HFpEF mouse model that incorporates both genetic predisposition for obesity/diabetes and pressure-overload, the two major risk factors for HFpEF, by performing trans-aortic constriction (TAC) in the ob/ob mice. We have also perfected the experimental tools and data analysis platform to provide O-PTM profiling at the whole-proteome level in hearts. Accordingly, we have strategically formulated the following aims according to three phenotypic levels: At the systemic level, Aim 1 will establish and characterize in vivo mouse models of HFpEF vs. HFrEF by cardiac and mitochondrial function as well as redox status. At the organellar level, Aim 2 will conduct targeted proteomics profiling of the cardiac mitochondria and extract O-PTM signatures using ML-based methods to achieve deep phenotyping of HFpEF and HFrEF. This information will then be integrated and enriched in an O- PTM molecular atlas and knowledge graph. At the molecular level, Aim 3 will target the BCAA catabolic pathway to exhaustively scrutinize its role in HFpEF and HFrEF. A multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE HFpEF is highly prevalent, yet there are few effective treatments or clear criteria to differentiate it from HFrEF. We propose to extract molecular signatures unique to HFpEF and HFrEF using a novel HFpEF mouse model and machine learning-based approaches. We anticipate that a multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway,10183311,R01HL146739,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biology', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Cardiac', 'Catabolism', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Defect', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'EFRAC', 'Enzymes', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glucose', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Homeostasis', 'Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Myocardium', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinness', 'Treatment Failure', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'base', 'computational platform', 'constriction', 'effective therapy', 'empowered', 'exhaustion', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'heart function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'knowledge graph', 'men', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'protein function', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,649707
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record.

"Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern PI: Valentina Kutyifa, MD, PhD University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY Morbidity, mortality, and health care costs of the treatment of systolic heart failure (HF) are rapidly increasing. Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) is cost-effectively reducing HF events and death in HF patients with a wide QRS and low ejection fraction. However, response to CRT-D is not unequivocally present in all patients, with less benefit in those without the presence of an ECG abnormality, left bundle branch block (non-LBBB), posing a significant treatment challenge. Because of the conflicting and limited data on response to CRT-D in this cohort, it is possible that we currently treat a large proportion of HF patients with non-LBBB who have limited or no benefit from the device. Therefore, better selection of patients for this expensive therapy is warranted. One of our recent studies suggested a clinical benefit in patients with non-LBBB and marked echocardiography response, and identified predictors. However, there is a need to prospectively validate these predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB in this hard-to-treat patient population, and identify potential novel ECG and echocardiography predictors, utilizing novel statistical methods of machine learning. We propose a prospective, observational, single-arm study in a currently guideline-indicated cohort to validate and identify predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D, including novel ECG and echocardiography markers, and to assess subsequent clinical outcomes in 270 HF patients with an implanted CRT-D and non-LBBB ECG pattern. The primary aim of the study is to prospectively validating our previously identified clinical predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in HF patients with non-LBBB that could enable better patient selection. Our secondary aim is to identify the incremental value of novel ECG and echocardiography variables to predict echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB patients, including ECG variables of sum absolute QRST integral and ventricular electrical activation delay, and echocardiography-derived variables of left ventricular dyssynchrony and contractility. Then we will apply the developed predictive model to prospectively identify non- LBBB patients with CRT-D at a risk of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Tertiary aim is to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors of response in non-LBBB using machine learning analysis. Study population will include 270 HF patients with non-LBBB (135 with mild HF and 135 with advanced HF) and an implanted CRT-D with 6 months echocardiography follow-up analyzed by an echocardiography core lab, and assessing clinical outcomes of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) in heart failure (HF) patients without left bundle branch block (non-LBBB) has been less beneficial to improve outcomes despite being a guideline indicated therapy, posing a significant treatment challenge. However, non-LBBB patients with echocardiography response to CRT-D have better outcomes, and pre-implant variables could predict response, identifying patients who benefit the most. In this study, we plan to enroll 270 HF patients with non-LBBB and guideline- indicated CRT-D implantation to validate our prior echocardiography predictor score, and to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors using conventional statistics and machine learning analysis. We will also assess the applicability of such a score for clinical outcomes of HF, ventricular arrhythmias, or death.",Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern,10207993,R01HL153390,"['Attenuated', 'Biological', 'Bundle-Branch Block', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defibrillators', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mosses', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular End-Systolic Volumes', 'arm', 'base', 'cardiac implant', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'statistics', 'study population']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,734112
"q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy Project Summary/Abstract  Ischemic heart disease remains the top cause of death in the world. Acute myocardial infarction (MI) causes regional dysfunction which places remote areas of the heart at a mechanical disadvantage resulting in long term adverse left ventricular (LV) remodeling and complicating congestive heart failure (CHF). The course of MI and post-MI remodeling is complex and includes vascular and myocellular injury, acute and chronic inflammation, alterations of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis. Stress echocardiography is a clinically established, cost-effective technique for detecting and characterizing coronary artery disease and myocardial injury by imaging the LV at rest and after either exercise or pharmacologically-induced stress to reveal ischemia and/or scar. In our previous effort on this project, we developed quantitative 3D differential deformation measures for stress echocardiography from 4DE-derived LV strain maps taken at rest and after dobutamine stress. These measures can localize and quantify the extent and severity of LV myocardial injury and reveal ischemic regions. We now propose that improved versions of these same measures can be used for both targeting of therapy and outcomes assessment in the treatment of adverse local myocardial remodeling following MI. We choose a particular up and coming therapeutic strategy as an exemplar: the local delivery of injectable hydrogels within the MI region that are intended to alter the biomechanical properties of the LV myocardium, as well as inflammation, and thereby help to minimize adverse remodeling. Our new, robust approach for estimating improved dense displacement and differential deformation measures is based on an innovative data-driven, deep feed-forward, neural network architecture that employs domain adaptation between data from labeled, carefully-constructed synthetic models of physiology and echocardiographic image formation (i.e. with ground truth), and data from unlabeled noisy in vivo porcine or human echocardiography (missing or very limited ground truth). Training is based on tens of thousands of four-dimensional (4D) image-derived patches from these two domains, initially based on displacements derived separately from shape-based processing of conventional B-mode data and block-mode, speckle-tracked processing of raw radio-frequency (RF) data; and later based on learning directly from B-mode and RF image intensity information. After non-rigid registration of rest and stress 4DE image sequences, quantitative 4D differential deformation parameters will be derived from porcine and human echocardiographic test data. These parameters will be derived at baseline, and at several timepoints after delivery of injectable hydrogels into the MI region. The ability of the differential deformation parameters derived from 4D stress echocardiography to guide local delivery of injectable hydrogels in a MI region and assess/predict outcomes will then be determined in a hybrid acute/chronic porcine model of MI and post-MI remodeling. The technique will be translated to humans and evaluated by measuring the reproducibility and the relationship to remodeling of our new robust, deep learning-based differential deformation parameters in a small cohort of subjects. Project Narrative  At the core of the proposed effort is the development and evaluation of novel 4D (three spatial dimensions over time) echocardiographic imaging, image analysis, and machine learning methods that will enable the accurate and robust quantification of changes in myocardial deformation due to stress. Our methods will use this information to guide delivery and assess outcome of a promising new therapy to improve the biomechanical properties of the heart after myocardial injury based on injectable hydrogels.","q4DE: A Biomarker for Image-Guided, Post-MI Hydrogel Therapy",10139080,R01HL121226,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood Vessels', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dobutamine', 'Echocardiography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Family suidae', 'Four-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'Four-dimensional', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Ischemia', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitor', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Stains', 'Stress', 'Stress Echocardiography', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Remodeling', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'feedforward neural network', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'myocardial injury', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'radio frequency', 'spatiotemporal', 'synthetic construct', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,790095
"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target.

"Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of hospitalization and mortality. While a number of evidence- based therapies have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with HF, nearly half of these patients are not regularly taking their medications. Although medication adherence can be improved through timely interventions, it is challenging for clinicians to accurately identify and predict medication non-adherence at the point of care. The challenge persists partly because medication adherence is a complex process influenced by an interplay of a multitude of patient-, provider-, system-, community-, and therapy-related factors. This gap in identifying patients at risk of non-adherence can be addressed through increasing availability of relevant data from electronic health records (EHRs), which affords the potential to make accurate, real time predictions of adherence in HF. In particular, recent linkages of EHR and pharmacy data has created opportunity for incorporation of prior medication fills into EHR-based adherence prediction models that are updated continuously. Using machine learning (ML) techniques with such data allows for incorporation of a large number of intercorrelated risk factors and their interactions into models and for accommodating continuous updates as new information becomes available. Our objective is to build a ML-based algorithm to predict adherence among patients with HF. The specific aims are: 1) to develop supervised ML algorithms to predict medication adherence among HF patients, using EHR clinical data, linked pharmacy fill data, and location- based social determinants data from a large, urban health system that cares for a diverse patient population; 2) to assess fairness of the developed algorithms by evaluating cross-validated prediction and calibration on patient subgroups based on social and economic factors, to ensure that the desirable prediction performance is maintained for the diverse groups; and 3) to assess generalizability of the algorithms through validation in a second large, urban health system caring for a diverse population. Our approach is innovative and novel in several ways. First, we will take advantage of linkages between pharmacy fill information and the EHR to incorporate pharmacy data in our models. Second, we utilize geocoding of patient addresses combined with publicly available data to incorporate neighborhood-level social determinants of health, which are among the most important predictors of adherence, into our models. Third, we will assess fairness of the model by evaluating the predictive performance and calibration on patients from diverse backgrounds. Fourth, we will ensure generalizability of the prediction algorithm by developing it in one diverse health system and validating the algorithm in a second diverse health system. These models will be developed such that they can be used for point-of-care adherence prediction. Our long term goal is to be able to implement them into the EHR, at which point they can be incorporated into interventions to address medication adherence and, ultimately, improve both adherence and clinical outcomes for patients with HF. Project Narrative Poor medication adherence in heart failure can lead to poor health, but many clinicians are unable to determine who would benefit from interventions to address adherence. We will build machine learning models to identify patients at risk of not taking their medicines using an approach that minimizes potential biases. Electronic health record data will be used in these models, allowing them to be incorporated into interventions to improve medication adherence and reduce the disease burden of heart failure.",Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure,10095553,R01HL155149,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Development', 'Economic Factors', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'Urban Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'contextual factors', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,690075
"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics. In all three aims, large animal studies and human subject data will be used for optimization and validation.

"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health. NARRATIVE This proposal describes a platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical forces in cells, which play major roles in human health. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride.

"Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) 30-day readmissions generate over a third of HF healthcare costs in the US and are the leading cause of US 30-day readmissions. Drivers of HF readmissions include increasing complexity associated with clinical, social, and behavioral factors. Despite numerous interventions, readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these could be prevented by a multidisciplinary approach promoting better connections to and communication with clinical care teams while addressing social and behavioral barriers to HF care. Community health workers (CHWs) are members of medical teams who address social, behavioral, and basic clinical factors influencing health outcomes while fostering patient connections to and communication with care teams. CHW care is one of a few interventions shown to reduce readmissions in patients with chronic disease. However, CHW care relies on intensive 1:1 patient care models that do not leverage technology which limits efficiency and scalability. There has been limited attention on developing technology-based interventions in CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. A HF mobile phone application-based digital platform that utilizes artificial intelligence driven biometric data to minimize false alarms, promotes early identification of true decline, and encourages communication with providers was developed in 2016 to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Preliminary clinical trial data for the digital platform has been promising. A prototype designed for patients with HF and the CHWs caring for them has recently been created. The current proposal will assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention to reduce HF 30-day readmissions. Aim 1: Identify behavioral (e.g., diet, activity) and social (e.g., socioeconomic status, social supports, living situation) factors that influence HF outcomes relevant to a digitally-enabled CHW intervention by performing semi-structured interviews with 30 patients with HF and 20 CHWs. Aim 2: Test usability of a digitally- enabled CHW intervention (focused on CHW workflow integration) in 10 patients with HF in an open pilot trial. Aim 3: Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of implementing a digitally-enabled CHW intervention compared to CHW care to reduce HF 30-day readmissions within a pilot RCT (n=50). The candidate’s overall career goals are: to identify social and behavioral drivers of HF/cardiovascular clinical outcomes; to develop expertise in qualitative methods, behavioral science, and RCTs; and ultimately, to develop interventions that improve care and reduce costs in HF/cardiovascular disease and other NHLBI diseases seen by generalists. This training plan includes strong mentorship, formal coursework, and scientific meetings with cohesive training in behavioral and social sciences, qualitative research, and the conduction of RCTs. This proposal investigates a potentially transformative intervention that addresses important gaps in the literature by assessing the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effectiveness of a digitally-enabled CHW intervention in reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement. Project Narrative: Despite ongoing efforts to improve outcomes in heart failure (HF), a leading cause of mortality and elevated healthcare costs, 30-day HF readmission rates remain elevated and a quarter of these are preventable. Community health worker (CHW) care delivery has been shown to improve healthcare outcomes but inefficiency limits its scalability. Implementation of a 30-day digitally-enabled CHW intervention for HF patients may provide support for similar interventions in larger HF/cardiovascular populations by reducing 30-day readmissions and improving patient engagement.",Implementing a digitally-enabled community health worker intervention for patients with heart failure,10084315,K23HL150287,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Car Phone', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Community Health Aides', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early identification', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Research', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Team', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Singapore', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'behavioral/social science', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinical care', 'cohesion', 'comorbidity', 'comparison intervention', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'health difference', 'hospital readmission', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'patient engagement', 'pilot trial', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'readmission rates', 'social', 'social factors', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'treatment as usual', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,198857
"Mentoring in patient-oriented atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular research PROJECT SUMMARY This application will provide the Principal Investigator, Dr. Alvaro Alonso, with protected time and other support to (1) accelerate a successful record of mentoring junior clinical investigators and graduate students engaged in patient-oriented cardiovascular research; (2) obtain additional training in omics, machine learning, and mentoring best-practices; and (3) advance Dr. Alonso's ongoing research on the risk factors and mechanisms contributing to the development of atrial fibrillation (AF). Mentoring activities will build upon the ongoing involvement of Dr. Alonso in several training programs at Emory University, including an NHLBI-funded multidisciplinary T32 training grant on cardiovascular health disparities, the research-track Cardiology fellowship program at the School of Medicine, and the Master of Public Health and PhD programs in epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health. Training will focus on cutting-edge methodological areas in rapid development, including integration of omic technologies and machine learning in patient-oriented research, as well as acquisition of skills in academic, research, and clinical mentoring. Finally, this award will support a research project that extends Dr. Alonso's ongoing work on understanding the factors influencing the development of the AF substrate, understanding AF pathophysiology, and preventing AF-related outcomes. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to identify novel AF phenotypes (phenogroups) using extensive clinical and multi-omic data (“phenomapping”), (2) to discover specific risk factors for the different AF phenogroups, and (3) to determine associations of AF phenogroups with selected endpoints (stroke, heart failure, mortality). These research aims will be carried out in the context of the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, an ongoing prospective registry of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in three Emory-affiliated hospitals currently including approximately 7,000 unique individuals with detailed phenotyping, clinical outcomes, and multi-omic markers. In summary, the activities proposed in this application will favorably impact Dr. Alonso's capabilities to conduct cutting-edge and innovative patient-oriented research on cardiovascular prevention and his ability to perform as a highly qualified mentor for junior clinicians pursuing research on clinical cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite progress, atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia, remains a major public health program. This award will contribute to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of atrial fibrillation. In addition, it will support a nurturing environment for the mentoring of junior clinical investigators interested in prevention and treatment of atrial fibrillation and other cardiovascular diseases.",Mentoring in patient-oriented atrial fibrillation and cardiovascular research,10179458,K24HL148521,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Blood specimen', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Management', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Fellowship Program', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Stratification', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'candidate selection', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular health', 'career development', 'graduate student', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lifestyle factors', 'medical schools', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient registry', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'sociodemographic factors', 'sociodemographics', 'transcriptomics', 'trend']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K24,2021,118502
"PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) Project Summary The objective of PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) is to discover novel biomarker signatures of post cardiac arrest brain and extracerebral organ failure that predict treatment responsiveness and long-term recovery. We will achieve this by partnering with the ICECAP trial, a response-adaptive dose finding clinical research trial that seeks to determine the optimal duration of post-arrest hypothermia. Cardiac arrest is a major public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Four in five patients hospitalized after cardiac arrest have significant brain injury, and death from neurologic damage is common. Improving survival and functional recovery is a critical public health objective and will require innovative approaches. The current clinical situation is unprecedented. Currently post-CA brain injury is an acute, sudden critical illness with major knowledge gaps about how best to characterize severity of injury and to identify which individual patients are likely to benefit from specific neuroprotective strategies. Thus, development of high- performing biomarker signatures is a critical need and would translate in to immediate changes in care. We hypothesize that not all patients are identical (i.e. there will be a heterogeneity of treatment effect) and that through our innovative, multi-parametric data driven approach, we will be able to identify novel signatures that define subgroups of patients. Advanced data science and analytical approaches will allow the identification of these subgroups that was previously not possible. These subgroups will be clinically important insofar as they will indicate differential responses to treatment and different trajectories of functional recovery. This project will acquire high resolution multi-modal data early in the disease course that will allow us to address these current knowledge gaps and improve our understanding of the disease in the early acute setting when interventions can improve outcome. The knowledge learned here will be applied to develop personalized treatments for cardiac arrest survivors, addressing the NIH's and our goals of lengthening life and reducing disability. Project Narrative Post-cardiac arrest injury affects the brain and other critical organs and is a major public health problem causing significant death and disability. This project will use novel data-driven approaches to collect high resolution monitoring data from patients in the critical care unit and will use that multi-parametric data to develop newly defined patient sub-groups with differing clinical trajectories and responses to therapies. This project will have a major impact on public health by allowing treatment of the right patient at the right time with the right therapy, thereby reducing disability and saving lives.",PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP),10099869,R01NS119825,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Death', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiopulmonary Physiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Neurosciences', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Pupil light reflex', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rewarming', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'natural hypothermia', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1648754
"Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of drug discovery attrition across all of preclinical and clinical drug discovery. While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many cancer chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer survivors of some cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer recurrence. Cardiac contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that propagate through the heart and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus. Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+ can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations (EADs and DADs) that initiate arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of contractile proteins. Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is primarily thought to cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also heterogeneous in their voltage, calcium, and contractile functions, and in their responses to therapeutic candidates. Thus, it is highly desirable to simultaneously measure AP, Ca2+ and contractile function on a cell- by-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes, but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this unmet need we propose to develop a high throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously quantifes voltage, calcium, and contractile motion in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs will be labeled with fluorescent indicators of calcium and voltage, and the cells imaged via high-speed automated microscopy during contractile activity. The use of hiPSC-CMs will enable “clinical trials” in a dish, in which test compounds are tested across cells representing several donors. Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR project will develop the basic protocol and perform a proof-of-concept screen of 30 test compounds on hiPSC-CMs representing 5 donors. In Phase II, a large validation study (~350 compounds, 7-concentration dose-response, 30 min and 72 hr exposures) will be performed. Artificial intelligence will be utilized to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the assay by detecting complex arrhythmia waveforms. This assay represents a human-based preclinical model that will be less expensive and more predictive for cardiotoxicity testing than animal models and will be marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for contract research. FDA guidelines stipulate that all new drugs be tested for dangerous side-effects on the heart as part of preclinical research; however, the current tests are poorly predictive of both dangerous and safe drugs leading to unwarranted attrition and dangerous drugs reaching clinic. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor tissue (iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) are widely considered to hold great promise for clinical trial in a dish studies of drug cardiotoxicity. This STTR proposal is to commercialize a high throughput platform to accurately identify drug candidates that have cardiac side effects, in particular adding the ability to detect the type of primary heart cell damage common with anti-cancer drugs in a fully automated (high throughput) robotic assay for the first time, to improve the efficiency of preclinical research and the safety of human clinical trials, which will also likely have the added benefit of reducing animal research.","Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes",10268102,R42HL158510,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Aging', 'American', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Contract Services', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Dangerousness', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Industry', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitochondria', 'Motion', 'Myocardium', 'Myopathy', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Contracts', 'Risk Assessment', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer survival', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cell injury', 'cellular imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'compound 30', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'heart cell', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'instrument', 'lead series', 'male', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'side effect', 'therapeutic candidate', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies', 'voltage']",NHLBI,"VALA SCIENCES, INC.",R42,2021,299871
"Multimorbidity and Treatment-Related Outcomes in Older Heart Failure Patients PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF) is the most common reason for hospitalization in older adults. Over 85% of all patients hospitalized with HF are 65 years of age or older. Multimorbidity, typically defined as the presence of ≥2 chronic conditions, increases the risks of hospitalization and death in older HF patients, and greatly complicates the clinical management of HF. Caution is required in applying national clinical practice guidelines to the care of older adults with multimorbidity, as this could result in undesirable net effects and less than optimal outcomes including adverse interactions between drugs and various concomitant diseases. In response to PA-17-088 (Exploratory Analyses of Existing Cohorts, Data Sets, and Stored Biospecimens to Address Clinical Aging Research Questions, R01), we propose to leverage an existing HF cohort, including data for more than 100,000 patients with HF within the Cardiovascular Research Network between 2005-2012, with follow-up data up to 2017. We will extend our previous efforts by examining treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in older adults with HF and a wide spectrum of multimorbidity burden. We will further examine the benefits and adverse outcomes of various therapies focusing on particularly vulnerable subgroups of patients with HF afflicted by two prevalent conditions, anemia or diabetes. Our specific aims are: (1) to examine the effectiveness of selected medical therapies (renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and aldosterone receptor blockers) on death, HF hospitalization, and all-cause hospitalizations in a large, community-based population of older adults with HF across a range of levels of multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction; (2) to evaluate targeted adverse outcomes, including kidney dysfunction, hyperkalemia, sodium disturbances, bradycardia, and syncope associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF, stratified by multimorbidity burden and left ventricular ejection fraction status; and (3) to characterize the potential benefits and adverse outcomes associated with selected HF therapies in older adults with HF and two prevalent comorbidity dyads—HF- diabetes and HF-anemia—that are common and substantially increase the risks of death and morbidity. In addition, we will create novel, validated methods to identify adverse outcomes related to HF therapies from unstructured data in large electronic health record systems through natural language processing technology, along with employing state-of-the-art analytic approaches to evaluate treatment-related outcomes. In that our proposed investigation will take advantage of a large, geographically and demographically diverse cohort of adults with HF receiving care within community-based healthcare delivery systems, we anticipate our findings will be highly generalizable to the broad spectrum of older adults with HF managed in “real-world” practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The presence of multiple chronic conditions, or multimorbidity, in older adults with heart failure substantially increases the complexity of their care, and increases the risks of hospitalization and death. In our study, we will examine treatment patterns and the net benefits versus harms of selected therapies in patients with heart failure and multimorbidity.
