"Computational Diffusion MRI for Studying Early Human Brain Development Computational Diffusion MRI for Studying Early Human Brain Development Abstract In the ﬁrst years of life, the human brain develops dynamically in both structure and function. Many neurodevel- opmental disorders are associated with aberrations from normative growth during this critical period of early brain development. The increasing availability of longitudinal baby MRI data, such as those acquired through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP), affords unprecedented opportunity for precise charting of early brain developmental trajectories in order to understand normative and aberrant growth. Dedicated computational tools are needed for accurate processing and analysis of baby MR images, which typically exhibit dynamic heterogeneous changes across time. The goal of this project is to equip brain researchers with computational tools effective for studying the early developing human brain in terms of tissue microstructure and white matter pathways using diffusion MRI. We propose three aims. In Aim 1, we will develop computational tools for effective estimation of white matter pathways in the baby brain via diffusion tractography. We will tackle the challenge of tracking through regions with low diffusion anisotropy owing to ongoing myelination in the developing brain. Our tools will allow proper characterization of complex white matter pathway patterns such as fanning and bending. This will allow solving the gyral bias problem ubiquitous in existing tractography algorithms with ﬁber streamlines terminating predomi- nantly at gyral crowns but not sulcal banks. Our tools will allow tracing of cortico-cortical and cortico-subcortical pathways with more uniform coverage of the cortex. In Aim 2, we will develop microstructural analysis meth- ods that are unconfounded by complex ﬁber conﬁgurations, such as crossing, bending, branching, kissing, and fanning, allowing more accurate and speciﬁc characterization of changes in tissue microarchitecture during early brain development. In Aim 3, we will develop techniques that will allow diffusion MRI data collected at multiple sites, which are very common in the era of big data, to be harmonized to mitigate the negative effects of inter-site variability. Unlike existing methods that harmonize derived quantities such as fractional anisotropy, our method can be applied directly to the diffusion-weighted images, allowing measurements based on microstructure and connectivity to be subsequently computed for consistent analysis. We will also develop deep learning tools for multi-shell data prediction so that diffusion MRI data collected with different numbers of shells can be harmonized. Successful completion of this project will empower the neuroscience community with computational tools to better chart the normative early development of the human brain using diffusion MRI. The developed tools will also enable quantitative brain examinations of children who are affected by neurological developmental disorders. Project Narrative This project will empower neuroscience researchers with robust computational tools needed to study the early developing human brain in terms of tissue microstructure and white matter connection pathways using diffusion MRI. We will develop tools to tackle challenges speciﬁc to analyzing infant diffusion MRI data, including (i) com- plex microstructure arising from the interweaving of differentially oriented neurites (axons and dendrites) in the context of the extracellular matrix; and (ii) complex white matter ﬁber geometries, such as crossing, bending, and fanning. We will also create tools to cater to the big-data era need of dealing with data from multiple imaging sites with potential discrepancies in acquisition protocols and scanner behaviors, allowing intra- and inter-site variability to be reduced via data harmonization for consistent analysis with signiﬁcantly boosted statistical power.",Computational Diffusion MRI for Studying Early Human Brain Development,10317389,R01MH125479,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Award', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Dental crowns', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Felis catus', 'Fiber', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Life', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Myelin', 'Nature', 'Neurites', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'North Carolina', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'critical period', 'data harmonization', 'deep learning', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'myelination', 'tool', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,456443
"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. Using currently available advanced magnetic resonance imaging technology, data collected from a controlled subject cohort will be used to develop and test the proposed kinematic proﬁling technology on the moving wrist.",Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI,10107769,R21AR075327,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological Process', 'Biomechanics', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedics', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population Control', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Scaphoid bone', 'Semilunar Bone', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surgeon', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Upper Extremity', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Wrist joint', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'blood perfusion', 'bone', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'human subject', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'joint mobilization', 'kinematics', 'motion sensor', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'soft tissue', 'task analysis', 'tool', 'translational study', 'volunteer', 'water diffusion']",NIAMS,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,R21,2021,163890
"CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Abstract Many studies have established strong relationships between cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), morphological and physiological brain changes, including stroke, and cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer disease and related disorders (ADRD). New physiological and functional MRI (fMRI) methods allow non- invasive measurement of regional cerebral blood flow, vascular reactivity and physiological brain connectivity. These techniques provide the means to evaluate the morphology, pathophysiology, and brain dysfunction related to CEVD and ADRD. The CARDIA Year 25 and Year 30 Brain MRI Substudies were designed to incorporate state-of-the-art MRI technology into the relatively younger population of CARDIA in order to determine MRI correlates of CVD risk factors and detect early CEVD. These studies documented early MRI changes of CEVD with strong correlations to CVD risk factors, particularly hypertension. The CARDIA Year 35 MRI Ancillary Study is intended to extend these earlier studies into the late middle age population of CARDIA. Most biomarkers of CEVD and ADRD are weakly expressed until approximately age 55, when they begin their precipitous rise to the steep slope evident in the 6th and 7th decades of life. Correspondingly, subclinical disease becomes clinically evident, reflected by increasing physiological changes and cognitive deficits. However, confounding the effects of CEVD are age, lifestyle, and co-morbidities, including ADRD. CARDIA, with its lengthy and rich historical data, is well-positioned to dissect the intricacies of CEVD and putative relationship to ADRD in the transition from middle age to seniority, starting at ages with few comorbidities and low medication use. Approximately 1044 participants will be enrolled in the Ancillary Study from the four participating Field Centers. MRI participants will be recruited from previous CARDIA Brain MRI participants and receive brain MRI scans and cognitive testing as defined for Y25 and Y30. Computer analysis of MRI data will be reported quantitatively by anatomic regions-of-interest. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings, 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes, and 3) identify early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level. CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Project Narrative The CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI ancillary proposal will study the long-term associations between cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease risk factors, brain MRI findings, clinical events, and cognitive changes in young and mid adulthood as reflected in the CARDIA population. Early-onset and mid-life clinical events and cognitive changes in conjunction with a third brain MRI study and cognitive testing will allow us to define MRI pattern subtypes better reflecting pathophysiological variants reflective of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings. 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes reflective of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and 3) identify new, early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level.",CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal,10171752,R01AG062819,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Ancillary Study', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Analysis', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'blood pressure regulation', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain volume', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'early onset', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'men', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'sex', 'study population', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,995375
"Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers PROJECT SUMMARY  Gynecologic cancers are some of the most lethal diseases affecting women. Globally, one woman dies of cervical cancer every two minutes. MRI is increasingly used in the evaluation of gynecologic and many other cancers. Beyond its established use for cancer staging, there has long been an interest in the use of MRI-derived quantitative metrics to gain insights into the tumor microenvironment. Parametric maps obtained from quantification of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI data can be used to study tumor vascularity and identify tumors that are better perfused and oxygenated and thus more sensitive to some treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. However, the relative slow imaging speed and motion sensitivity of current MRI technology results in non-reliable and non-reproducible quantification of DCE-MRI data, which restricts its application in clinical practice.  Our group is a world leader in development of rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI techniques, in particular using combinations of radial imaging and compressed sensing. We developed the technique called GRASP, which was conceived as an academic-industrial partnership and has now been successfully translated into standard clinical practice. Though powerful, the first generation of GRASP has limitations. First, radial imaging is robust to motion, but not free of motion, which usually results in blurring. Second, GRASP uses a very simple sparsifying transform for compressed sensing, which can introduce issues with quantification. Third, GRASP was not originally developed for pharmacokinetic analysis and misses important ingredients such as integration of AIF estimation and T1 mapping. Fourth, image reconstruction time is still very long – in the order of several minutes.  We have developed new advances to circumvent these limitations and offer a new DCE-MRI technique with increased speed, motion-resistance and personalized AIF estimation and T1 mapping for pharmacokinetic analysis. Following the PAR-18-009 guidelines, our main goal is to form an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to translate these new developments in quantitative DCE-MRI for use in patients with gynecologic and other type of cancers. Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Develop and implement a fast motion-resistant quantitative DCE-MRI technique that goes beyond GRASP  to offer increased speed and resistance to motion; dynamic T1 mapping; and personalized and automated  pharmacokinetic analysis 2. Evaluate the repeatability, reproducibility and preliminary tumor response assessment of the fast motion-  robust quantitative DCE-MRI technique (“DCE-new”) and compare DCE-new to standard of care DCE-MRI  (“DCE-standard”) in patients with gynecologic cancer 3. Develop and evaluate fast image reconstruction algorithms based on deep learning PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to establish an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to develop and disseminate advances in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI for use in cancer patients. The new developments, which include radial imaging, compressed sensing, and deep learning, will deliver rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI with high spatial and temporal resolution for more accurate and reproducible quantification of MRI-derived metrics. The new technology to be disseminated as a prototype on GE scanners will promote the use of quantitative DCE-MRI biomarkers in clinical practice, a long-desired goal.",Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers,10267713,R01CA244532,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Early treatment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Gynecologic', 'Gynecology', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Radial', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Speed', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motion sensitivity', 'new technology', 'novel', 'population based', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,568123
"Rapid Motion-Robust and Easy-to-Use Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Liver Perfusion Quantification Project Summary The broad objective of this application is to develop a rapid motion-robust and easy-to-use dynamic contrast- enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) framework for liver perfusion quantification and to evaluate its performance in quantitative assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent primary malignancy in the liver. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) using gadolinium-based contrast agents is currently a cornerstone for identifying and characterizing hepatic lesions, including HCC. However, the current clinical use of liver DCE-MRI is limited to visual assessment of the pattern of perfusion in 3-4 multiphasic images (arterial, venous and delayed phases), and these images are routinely acquired during multiple breath holds. DCE-MRI also has the potential for quantitative assessment of perfusion kinetics, which can provide a deeper insight into the tumor microenvironment for non-invasive characterization of different histological features of the tumor, such as tumor angiogenesis and aggressiveness. This is particularly relevant for HCC, which is typically diagnosed based on imaging without pathological confirmation from invasive biopsy. Unfortunately, conventional liver perfusion MRI techniques suffer from a number of important limitations that restrict its clinical implementation, including (1) slow imaging speed, (2) limited spatiotemporal resolution, (3) sensitivity to motion artifacts, and (4) time-consuming quantitative perfusion analysis. Meanwhile, the need for pre-contrast T1 mapping to convert MR signal to gadolinium concentration further complicates the already-cumbersome imaging workflow. These challenges and underlying complexity have all led to non-reproducible performance of liver perfusion MRI and have significantly diminished its ultimate clinical utility. In this project, we propose to develop new rapid MRI techniques combining novel motion-robust sampling strategies and advanced reconstruction models to address these challenges. The new imaging techniques will enable motion-robust 3D T1 mapping with whole-liver coverage for efficient estimation of contrast concentration and free-breathing DCE-MRI of the liver with high spatiotemporal resolution. We will also incorporate state-of-the-art methods in deep learning to further improve imaging performance, to reduce reconstruction time, and to substantially simplify perfusion quantification. These new technical developments will be integrated into a new liver perfusion MRI framework, which will be translated into the clinical setting for assessment of HCC in an exploratory clinical study. The overall hypothesis is that with the new imaging framework developed in the project, robust high spatiotemporal resolution perfusion MRI of the liver can be achieved under free breathing, and absolute quantification of liver perfusion can be performed without user- interaction. Given the rapidly rising incidence and substantial burden of HCC in the United States, successful completion of this project would enable significant progress towards improved characterization and management of HCC and other liver diseases with high clinical impact. Project Narrative The objective of this application is to develop and evaluate a rapid motion-robust and easy-to-use dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) framework for liver perfusion quantification. This new imaging framework is expected to promote the utilization, efficacy and clinical translation of liver perfusion MRI for improved management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other diseases of high clinical impact.",Rapid Motion-Robust and Easy-to-Use Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Liver Perfusion Quantification,10297597,R01EB030549,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Biopsy', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gadolinium', 'Hepatic', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver Dysfunction', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Burden', 'United States', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cancer type', 'care costs', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'contrast enhanced', 'curative treatments', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'feasibility testing', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'interest', 'liver imaging', 'mortality', 'motion sensitivity', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'routine imaging', 'side effect', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NIBIB,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,464700
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,10117035,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,709759
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies.

"FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening Abstract: Imaging of the human brain has seen explosive growth in the last two decades mainly through the various modalities of MRI. The massive amount of data requires automatic and robust tools for analysis. FreeSurfer (FS, surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) is one of the preeminent tools used for neuroimage analysis. FS has more than 44,000 downloads, and the core FS manuscripts have been cited more than 22,000 times. FS is part of the analysis core for many NIH-funded large-scale data acquisition projects such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD), as well as the UK BioBank. One third of the 600+ ADNI-based publications cite FS. Simply put, much of the innovative research done in neuroimaging would not be possible without FS. Started in 1998, FS is best known for providing detailed and automated anatomical analysis of T1-weighted MRI images, especially for the cortical surface. However, FS anatomical analysis provides an ideal substrate for all modes of brain imaging including functional MRI, diffusion MRI, PET, optical/NIRS, as well as EEG/MEG. FS provides tools to perform these analyses as well as software to integrate with other analysis tools (e.g., SPM, FSL, AFNI). FS has been used for presurgical planning and even in the operating room.  The original grant mostly centered around Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation (SAMSEG). SAMSEG uses parametric Bayesian generative modeling to segment brain images. The SAMSEG framework fits atlas priors and multivariate Gaussian intensity models to brain images (including MRI artifacts such as bias fields). SAMSEG can take any modality or combination of modalities as input. Since it adapts its intensity model, it is robust to differences in scanner. Since it is a generative model, it is easy to extend to encompass more segmentation details. For example, the SAMSEG framework has been used to segment hippocampal subfield, amygdalar nuclei, thalamic nuclei, and extracerebral structures.  The main vision for the renewal is to extend the SAMSEG framework to accommodate longitudinal models, incorporate more anatomical details, and to use SAMSEG output as a basis for cortical surface placement that is, like SAMSEG, modality independent and capable of using any combination of modalities. In addition, we propose a series of new tools that will assist in the individual and group analysis of large studies by creating study-specific models. In addition to this new technical development, we are requesting support for software engineering, maintenance, and user support – mundane and not innovative, but high-impact this type of support is critical to the thousands of researchers who rely on FreeSurfer. Narrative: This work will support the popular FreeSurfer neuroimaging analysis software program used by thousands of researchers world-wide. FreeSurfer uses cutting edge algorithms to automatically extract a host of biomarkers from brain imaging data which can be used for research, pharmaceutical evaluation, and diagnosis. This proposal will allow for continued support of FreeSurfer from the developers as well as new development to make FreeSurfer faster, more robust, and easier to interpret.","FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening",10130964,R01EB023281,"['Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Free Will', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inherited', 'Lesion', 'Leukoaraiosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating Rooms', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Software Engineering', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bone', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'human imaging', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555356
"Next-generation in-vivo fetal neuroimaging Next-Generation In-Vivo Fetal Neuroimaging The overall objective of this project is to dramatically improve fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to advance research in early human brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders, the burden of which is, unfortunately, high because of their life-long impact and high prevalence. Fetal MRI has been the technique of choice in studying prenatal brain development. Fetal motion, however, makes MRI slice acquisition unreliable at best, as the fetus frequently moves while the prescribed slices are imaged. Uncompensated fetal motion disrupts 3D coverage of the anatomy and reduces the spatial resolution of slice-to-volume reconstructions. Repeating the scans does not ensure full 3D coverage of the anatomy, but increases total acquisition time. This, in turn, dramatically reduces the success rate and reliability of fetal MRI in studying the development of transient fetal brain compartments that are selectively sensitive to injury over the course of fetal development. To mitigate these issues and improve fetal MRI, we propose to automatically measure fetal brain position and prospectively navigate slices to each new position in real-time. The impact of this approach will be to dramatically increase the success rate and spatial resolution of fetal MRI for the in-vivo investigation of developing brain compartments, while, in parallel, reducing scan time, effectively making fetal MRI less burdensome for the mother, more accurate, and cost effective. By eliminating the manual re- adjustment of stack-of-slice positions, the time that elapses between scans will be virtually continuous. Our proposed technique will also make fetal MRI less operator-dependent and thus, more reproducible across sites, which is essential to conducting multi-center studies and clinical trials. Prospective navigation of fetal MRI slices to compensate for motion requires the development of novel, real-time image processing algorithms to recognize the fetal brain and its position and orientation; to track fetal motion to steer slices; and to detect and re-acquire motion corrupted slices. In this project, we will develop innovative deep learning models to process fetal MRI slices in real-time; will translate those models into an integrated system to prospectively navigate fetal MRI slices; and will validate the system on fetuses scanned at various gestational ages. To assess the utility and impact of the proposed technology, we will measure subplate volume in fetuses. The four specific aims of this study are to 1) assess fetal MRI via variable density image acquisition and reconstruction; 2) achieve real-time recognition of the fetal brain in MRI slices; 3) develop a system of real-time fetal head motion tracking and steering of slices; and 4) measure the subplate volume in the developing fetal brain using MRI. These aims will collectively translate and validate new imaging and image processing techniques to advance fetal MRI, and effectively eliminate a critical barrier to making progress in the fields of developmental neurology and neuroscience. Project Narrative: The proposed research aims to develop, translate, and validate innovative in-vivo imaging technologies to improve imaging and studying the development of the human fetal brain before birth. The technology will enable and improve studies on the development of the brain in fetuses with congenital disorders or fetuses at risk of having neurodevelopmental issues later in life. This in-turn is expected to result in timely and more effective treatments and therapeutic interventions that will lead to vastly improved patient outcomes in both the short- and long-term, effectively reducing the burden of human disabilities arising from congenital disorders.",Next-generation in-vivo fetal neuroimaging,10280126,R01EB031849,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Congenital Disorders', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Head', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Live Birth', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uterus', 'absorption', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive disability', 'congenital heart disorder', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'fetal', 'fetus at risk', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'migration', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'real-time images', 'reconstruction', 'recurrent neural network', 'success', 'virtual']",NIBIB,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,588593
"Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer Project Summary Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard of care for early stage (≥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point. Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1) Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients (≥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study, a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to appropriate treatment at an earlier time point. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer amongst women and treatment decisions are based heavily on accurate and early imaging. By developing a technique that evaluates response to treatment earlier than the current standard of care, we will decrease morbidity and mortality by treating cervical cancer at an earlier time point, preventing further progression of disease. The development of new biomedical imaging techniques to fundamentally improve the detection and treatment of disease is directly relevant to one of the key missions of the NIH.",Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer,10121726,R37CA249659,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Brain', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Free Will', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Indolent', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical properties', 'cancer imaging', 'chemoradiation', 'classification algorithm', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'nerve injury', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'radiation response', 'radical hysterectomy', 'response', 'screening program', 'standard of care', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake', 'water diffusion']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R37,2021,640083
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10232306,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'high body mass index', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,651069
"Skeletal Myopathy in Systemic Sclerosis: Devising a Classification Schema Predictive of Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Skeletal myopathy in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is associated with increased disability and mortality. There is no consensus classification of SSc-associated myopathy that can be utilized to lay the groundwork for understanding muscle disease in scleroderma. We know that there is pathological, serological, and outcome heterogeneity that may be informative in defining distinct subsets of myopathy in SSc. Our preliminary data demonstrate that (1) muscle histopathology is heterogeneous in SSc, (2) patients with a fibrosing myopathy have poor outcomes, in particular cardiac death, and (3) there is intense signal uptake on advanced MRI imaging such as diffusion weighted and tensor imaging and T2 mapping in SSc-associated myopathy which may indicate early disease related changes when compared to conventional muscle MRI. This K23 proposal will first establish a Myopathy cohort (Aim 1), devise a classification schema and test its utility in predicting long term outcomes such as trajectory, cardiopulmonary disease, disability, mortality, and treatment responsiveness(Aim 2), and detect and quantify early disease related muscle changes on advanced muscle MRI (Aim 3). This application is for a K23 award for Julie Paik, MD, MHS, Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology at the Johns Hopkins University. Her long term career goal is to become a leading clinical investigator in scleroderma muscle disease in the context of observational cohort studies, state of the art imaging biomarkers, and clinical trial methodology. Her short term goal of devising this classification schema will provide a new gold standard for the validation of external myopathy cohorts in SSc and lay the framework for future studies directed at understanding biological mechanism and developing a therapeutic trial using measurable outcomes such as quantitative muscle MRI. This proposal takes advantage of the rich resources and infrastructure at the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center, a recently designated Precision Center of Excellence in 2018. Her mentoring team includes Dr. Laura Hummers and Dr. Fredrick Wigley, both renowned experts in SSc and clinical epidemiology, Dr. Andrew Mammen is an internationally recognized myositis expert, and Dr. Scott Zeger a leader in bio statistical and epidemiological research. Dr. Paik has recruited vital members to her Advisory Committee, composed of mentors and collaborators who have specific expertise relevant to the proposal and are fully supportive of Dr. Paik’s research and career goals. These include Dr. Michael Jacobs (advanced radiological imaging), Dr. Laura Fayad (musculoskeletal radiology), Dr. Andrea Corse (muscle histopathology), Dr. Tom Lloyd (classification schemas in inclusion body myositis), and Dr. Ami Shah (scleroderma translational research). This K23 award will allow Dr. Paik to gain the skills needed to analyze and develop a classification schema of skeletal myopathy in scleroderma, develop expertise in advanced muscle MRI analysis, and build her clinical trial skill set to ultimately support a future R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will establish a comprehensive, prospective myopathy cohort in systemic sclerosis (SSc or scleroderma) to ultimately devise a novel classification schema for SSc-associated myopathy that is predictive of outcomes such as treatment response, disability, cardiopulmonary disease trajectory, and death. Advanced muscle MRI techniques include diffusion weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and T2 mapping will also be used to detect and quantify early muscle disease related changes in SSc associated myopathy. The knowledge gained from this study will lay the foundation for discovering predictive biomarkers of disease course and to allow future studies of the specific biological process involved in each phenotype.",Skeletal Myopathy in Systemic Sclerosis: Devising a Classification Schema Predictive of Outcomes,10152533,K23AR073927,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Creatine Kinase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Edema', 'Electromyography', 'Enrollment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Process', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intramuscular', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rheumatology', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scleroderma', 'Serology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'career', 'clinical development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'diffusion weighted', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'illness length', 'imaging biomarker', 'interest', 'member', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'professor', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'skeletal', 'skills', 'treatment response', 'uptake']",NIAMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,158754
"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders.

"Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases Abstract Liver is commonly involved in metastatic disease in colorectal cancer (CRC) and knowledge about the presence and location of these tumors affects treatment decisions. In patients with CRC, surgical or ablative treatment of liver metastases improves overall survival. Early diagnosis of colorectal metastases (i.e. while lesions are small) is expected to improve treatment outcomes by increasing the number of subjects that can undergo surgical resection or by identifying subjects early on, when non-surgical options are an alternative treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is regarded as the most effective imaging modality for the detection and characterization of liver neoplasms; T2-weighted (T2w) and T1-weighted (T1w) images - combined with administration of a gadolinium chelate agent and multi-phase dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) - are the foundational acquisitions used for the detection and characterization of liver tumors. However, challenges remain for the detection and characterization of small lesions due to factors including inadequate spatial resolution, partial volume effects, physiological motion, and variations in timing of contrast arrival in DCE imaging. In this academic-industrial partnership the scientific and engineering teams at the University of Arizona and Siemens Medical Solutions are coming together to develop robust radial MRI techniques for T2w/T2 mapping and DCE imaging of the liver to improve detection and characterization of small tumors with the goal of bringing these techniques to routine clinical practice. The proposed work is based on a radial turbo spin- echo technique pioneered by the team at the University of Arizona for abdominal imaging and a radial stack-of-stars technique with continuous acquisition for DCE imaging. The specific aims of the partnership are: Aim 1: To develop radial T2w acquisition and reconstruction techniques with efficient full coverage of the liver for small tumor detection and accurate T2 quantification for tumor characterization. Aim 2: To implement a self-navigated 3D radial stack-of-stars technique for continuous acquisition of DCE data and retrospective reconstruction of the dynamic phases. Aim 3: To conduct a clinical evaluation of the techniques from Aims 1 and 2 against conventional T2w and DCE techniques. Aim 4: To streamline translation of the new radial methods to the clinic by developing a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline. The endpoints of our study include technical advances in MRI acquisitions that markedly overcome limitations of current liver MRI for the diagnosis of early metastases. We expect our proposal to yield technology improvements that will increase precision of care and outcomes in patients with metastatic malignancies, in particular those with colorectal cancer. Project Narrative Liver metastases are common in colorectal cancer and knowledge of number, location and size impacts precision of therapy, survival and overall costs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is commonly used for evaluating liver metastases but detection and diagnosis of small tumors remains challenging. Our proposal is based on a collaborative integrated team of university scientists, clinician-scientists and industry engineers to develop and clinically trial new MRI technology that overcomes limitations related to imaging small liver tumors in patients.",Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases,10063981,R01CA245920,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Benign', 'Breathing', 'Cessation of life', 'Chelating Agents', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resectable', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'colon cancer patients', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'liver imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized care', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,536670
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,10093035,R01EB016695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,558172
"Bridging diffusion MRI and chemical tracing for validation and inference of fiber architectures Project summary: This project will collect a unique, multi-modal, multi-contrast dataset with tracer injections and diffusion MRI in the same macaque brains. We will use this dataset to develop novel algorithms for inferring local fiber architectures from diffusion MRI. The goal is to overcome the limitations of current methods for diffusion orientation reconstruction, which are designed to resolve fiber crossings but not to distinguish between crossings and other configurations, such as branching, turning, fanning, etc. More broadly, the proposed dataset will allow us to investigate organizational principles of brain pathways and to provide a testbed for the neuroimaging community to evaluate the accuracy of diffusion tractography and microstructural modeling techniques. The project is a collaboration between groups with extensive expertise in diffusion MRI methodological development (MGH Martinos Center) and anatomical tracer studies (University of Rochester). We have previously collected high-resolution ex vivo diffusion MRI data on a set of macaque brains that had also received tracer injections. We have recently used these data in an open tractography challenge, with the participation of research teams from around the world. This was the first challenge of its kind to provide diffusion MRI data suitable for all state-of-the-art diffusion reconstruction methods (e.g., multi-shell or Cartesian grid sampling), in addition to providing the tracer injections in the same brains as the MRI scans. Our own preliminary studies and the challenge itself offer several insights into the performance of state-of-the-art tractography methods. For example, our results indicate that, while most tractography methods would require their parameters to be tuned differently to achieve optimal accuracy for different cortical seed regions, there are approaches that are robust across cortical areas. Furthermore, our results suggest that errors occur frequently in areas where the fiber architecture is not well modeled by a crossing. Thus there is a need for novel tractography approaches that go beyond the crossing-fiber paradigm. Here we propose to develop such an approach. Our prior work included injection sites in the frontal, prefrontal, and cingulate cortices only. Here we propose to investigate the extent to which our prior findings generalize across the brain, by performing tracer injections that sample a wider range of cortical areas. Furthermore, we will extend our acquisition protocol to acquire data appropriate not only for tractography, but also for microstructural and myelin mapping. These data will allow us to answer a broader range of questions about tractography, microstructure, and their intersection. Beyond the methodological development proposed in this project, the data will also be an invaluable resource to the neuroimaging community, providing researchers with a framework for the objective assessment of current diffusion MRI analysis methods and identifying areas for improvement to guide the development of next-generation techniques. Project narrative: This project will study organizational principles of brain pathways with a combination of chemical tracing and diffusion MRI. The ultimate goal is to assess and improve the accuracy of diffusion MRI, which is currently the only technique for imaging these pathways non-invasively and studying their role in the healthy and diseased brain in vivo. The unique dataset collected by this project will provide a testbed that can aid the neuroimaging research community in identifying shortcomings of current diffusion MRI analysis techniques and provide guidance towards seeking alternative approaches that overcome these shortcomings.",Bridging diffusion MRI and chemical tracing for validation and inference of fiber architectures,10099935,R01NS119911,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Caliber', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Macaca', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anatomical tracing', 'automated algorithm', 'brain pathway', 'cingulate cortex', 'convolutional neural network', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontal lobe', 'histological stains', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'sample fixation', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'tractography']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,666884
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,10155483,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'data quality', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,631942
"Harmonization of Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data from Complex Study Designs PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past decade, the number of large multi-center neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data which have been acquired with varying amounts of technical harmonization. Such efforts, which have focused on protocol harmonization and comparisons with imaging phantoms, have shown great strides toward reducing inter- scanner differences in imaging features extracted for further study. Unfortunately, MRI show inter-instrument biases even in the most carefully controlled studies. Our group, among many others, has shown that these differences often dwarf biological differences of interest measured using both structural and functional MRI.  To address this, the field has rapidly been developing tools for the harmonization of imaging data after acquisition. We have proposed several such tools, and our work has often focused on the adaptation of methods used in genomic studies for batch effect correction. Our most recent such work involved the ComBat method, which uses empirical Bayesian estimation to correct for site effects in both means and variances of imaging features under study. To date, these tools have been successfully applied in studies of cortical thickness, white matter microstructure, and functional connectivity. However, there are unfortunately several key limitations to the ComBat method for imaging studies that stem from its original conception for gene expression studies.  ComBat was designed for the study of inter-scanner differences in cross-sectionally acquired data. While cross-sectional studies are of great interest and exceedingly common, much focus in the context of healthy brain development and aging has shifted to measuring longitudinal trajectories. In such cases, the naïve application of ComBat is flawed and methodological research is necessary for appropriate harmonization tools to be developed. Furthermore, more complex nested study design in which multiple scanners are used per institution, or a subset of subjects are imaged on multiple scanners for harmonization purposes, are increasingly common. Another key area of interest in modern neuroimaging studies is to focus on inter-region structural or functional connectivity and uses multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to improve our understanding of phenotypic associations as well as for personalized predictions. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art in image harmonization ignores correlation structure between measurements, and thus inter- scanner differences often persist.  In this project, we propose a new generation of techniques that are applicable under complex study designs and harmonize appropriately for studies involving applications of MVPA. In our final aim of this proposal, we will apply the methods developed for more complex study designs and MVPA in the context of two of the largest NIH-funded multi-center consortia across the lifespan. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past decade, the number of large multi-center neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired using various study designs, but the statistical methodology necessary for harmonizing these data for integrated analyses is currently lacking. In this project, we propose to develop, implement, and apply next-generation imaging harmonization methods for data acquired longitudinally or from more complex study designs, as well as appropriate harmonization methods for use in conjunction with popular multivariate pattern analysis techniques.",Harmonization of Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data from Complex Study Designs,10188649,R01MH123550,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Advocate', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Controlled Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dwarfism', 'Federal Government', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investments', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cognitive development', 'combat', 'complex data', 'data harmonization', 'design', 'gray matter', 'healthy aging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'stem', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,603870
"Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most widespread non-traumatic, demyelinating disorder in young adults. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) aids in both diagnosing MS and assisting clinical management of patients. In addition to focal MS lesions, diffusely abnormal white matter (DAWM) is also seen on brain MRI in MS patients. While not understood completely, DAWM is thought to be a predictor of disease burden, possibly appears early on in the disease, and may be a marker of neurodegeneration in MS. However, longitudinal studies of DAWM are lacking, and segmentation of DAWM is manual, making it difficult to study the evolution of DAWM. The main objective of this proposal is to longitudinally study the development of DAWM in MS. This objective will be realized by analyzing preexisting longitudinal MRI data acquired on 1008 MS patients who participated in phase 3, blinded, multi-center clinical trial, referred to as CombiRx that was supported by NIH. The CombiRx data includes multi-contrast MRI and various clinical measures. Automatic identification of DAWM is a critical component of this proposal. Based on our preliminary studies, deep Learning (a class of machine learning algorithms) has the potential to automatically identify DAWM and estimate its volume. We will use the large CombiRx MRI data for training, validation, and testing of the deep learning models, and to study DAWM evolution in this MS cohort. The proposal has two major aims. In the first aim we will develop a deep learning model based on fully-convolutional neural networks for automatic segmentation of DAWM, gray matter, normal appearing white matter, and T2-hyperintense lesions guided by manual segmentation of two neuroimaging experts. In the second aim we will segment DAWM and all brain tissues, including focal lesions, at baseline and all available follow-up scans in the CombiRx cohort (up to 6.5 years). The temporal changes in volume, location, and MRI parameters of DAWM and focal T2 lesions will be computed. We will finally test whether DAWM is precursor to focal T2 lesions, associated with T2 lesion resolution, or a separate disease process altogether. If DAWM is shown to occur early on in the disease, it is possible to intervene sooner for improved outcome. Similarly, if DAWM is shown to be related to disease activity, it can serve as an objective and quantitative measure of the disease. Such an objective measurement would be highly valuable in developing targeted therapies and also in evaluating the treatment effect in MS patients. The main objective of this proposal is to study the evolution of diffusely appearing white matter (DAWM) in multiple sclerosis (MS) using a novel deep learning approach. The results of this study are expected to be highly valuable in evaluating the treatment effect in individual MS patients. These results can also help reduce time and money in conducting clinical trials substantially, which would lead to early introduction of promising drugs into the market. Finally, if DAWM occurs early on in the disease, as suggested by some of the publications, it is possible to therapeutically intervene sooner for improved outcome.",Detection and evolution of diffusely abnormal white matter in multiple sclerosis: a deep learning approach,10217627,R21NS118320,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Big Data', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Demyelinating Diseases', 'Demyelinations', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gliosis', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protons', 'Publications', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated segmentation', 'axonopathy', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment effect', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R21,2021,234000
"Next-Generation Cardiovascular MRI powered by Artificial Intelligence Project Summary/Abstract: Despite the accuracy and versatility of cardiovascular MRI, its footprint is only 1% among cardiac imaging tests (SPECT, echocardiography, CT, MRI) in the US. While there are several factors such as referral patterns favoring SPECT and echocardiography among cardiologists that account for low utilization, the two addressable obstacles that preclude widespread adoption are lengthy scan time (imaging facility operational cost) and reading (physician cost). These obstacles must be addressed for community hospitals with limited resources to adopt cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. While compressed sensing (CS), since its introduction into the MRI world in 2007, has led to highly-accelerated cardiovascular MRI acquisitions, the subsequent image reconstruction remains too slow (> 5 min for 2D time series, > 1 hour for 3D time series) for clinical translation (unmet need 1). Downstream, image analysis for cardiovascular MRI is notoriously labor intensive (e.g. 30- to 60-min) and limited (“circles” at two cardiac phases for cine MRI, whereas perfusion and late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) images are evaluated visually), for what is essentially a basic computer vision task (unmet need 2). In direct response, we will address these two unmet needs and unlock the enormous potential of CMR using deep learning (DL). DL applications have exploded since advancements in optimization and GPU hardware. While several recent studies have applied neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), U-Nets, and Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) for reconstruction and segmentation, no study has implemented an inline end-to-end pipeline that receives raw k-space from the MRI scanner and delivers both reconstructed images and fully processed images automatically with high speed (< 1 min). The objectives of this study are: a) developing a network for image reconstruction with maximal acceleration (aim 1), (b) developing a network for image processing tasks (aim 2), and c) developing an integrated, end-to-end network that does both (aim 3). By developing an architecture that can simultaneously learn maximal acceleration, fine tune end-to-end performance, and perform reconstruction/inference using feed-forward networks, we anticipate a disruptive technology that will lead to a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and increase its footprint in community hospitals. This 2-year study is doable because of the requisite database of raw k-space (not derived from DICOM) data (N = 617) and annotated cardiac MR images (N=3,021) from over 3,000 patients existing at our institution. Success of this proposal will deliver a disruptive technology that has potential to cause a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and enable widespread adoption of cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a new-generation cardiovascular MRI technology empowered by artificial intelligence, more specifically deep learning. The proposed technology accurately reconstructs cardiovascular images and segments cardiac regions of interest within 1 min without any human intervention.

"Artificial Intelligence Boosted Evolution and Detection of Genetically Encoded Reporters for In Vivo Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Magnetic resonance (MR) reporter genes have the potential to monitor transgene expression non-invasively in real time at high resolution. These genes can be applied to interrogate the efficacy of gene therapy, to monitor viral therapeutics and viral gene delivery, to assess cellular differentiation, cell trafficking, and specific metabolic activity, and also assess changes in the microenvironment. Efforts toward the development of MR reporter genes have been made for over a decade, but, despite these efforts, the field is still in its early developmental stage. This reflects the fact that there are numerous complications, caused by the low sensitivity of detection, the need for substrates with their associated undesirable pharmacokinetics, and/or the difficult and, in some cases, delayed interpretation of signal changes. We have previously demonstrated that many of these challenges can be overcome with the use of a lysine rich protein (LRP) reporter gene, that is detectable by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI. However, to mature the CEST reporter gene technology and bring it towards clinical translation, its sensitivity and specificity need to be improved. In particular, the LRP reporter gene specificity is limited by the fact that the lysine amide exchangeable protons of LRP have the same chemical shift as amide protons from endogenous proteins. It is therefore difficult to distinguish the reporter CEST contrast from the background CEST contrast, both of which may be changing with time. The specificity is further limited by the sensitivity of the CEST contrast to intracellular pH where the qualitative CEST contrast cannot distinguish between exchange rate and concentration effects. Finally, a decrease in cytosolic pH, observed in many disease pathologies, reduces the amide proton exchange rate and hence the CEST reporter sensitivity. We therefore propose to develop improved MRI reporter genes and quantitative MRI detection methods that will facilitate the clinical translation of these methods for imaging biological therapeutics, such as oncolytic virotherapy. We hypothesize that CEST reporter genes with improved sensitivity and specificity along with improved quantitative CEST methods will enable viral infection and replication to be monitored longitudinally throughout OV tumor therapy. To test this hypothesis and establish the clinical potential of MRI reporter genes we will capitalize on two transformative technologies developed in our labs; (Aim 1) an artificial intelligence based genetic programming algorithm will be used for optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of the CEST reporter gene and (Aim 2) a CEST magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) method will be used for the rapid quantification of both the reporter protein concentration and chemical exchange rate. (Aim 3) These methods will be validated for imaging oncolytic viral infection and replication in mouse glioblastoma tumor models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cell and viral based therapies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of many diseases. However, the optimization of such biological therapies depends critically on the ability to monitor the spread and persistence of the therapeutic agent and assess the tissue response. This project therefore proposes to develop and optimize a novel MRI reporter gene technology that allows for the imaging of biological therapeutics. The reporter gene technology will be demonstrated for monitoring oncolytic virotherapy in glioblastoma tumor models, however, the technology is generalizable to any biological therapeutic.",Artificial Intelligence Boosted Evolution and Detection of Genetically Encoded Reporters for In Vivo Imaging,10180072,R01EB031008,"['Algorithms', 'Amides', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Evolution', 'Fingerprint', 'Gene Transfer', 'Genes', 'Genetic Programming', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Oncolytic', 'Oncolytic viruses', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Problem Solving', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Protons', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detection method', 'detection sensitivity', 'gene therapy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'oncolytic virotherapy', 'pre-clinical', 'radio frequency', 'rapid technique', 'response', 'therapeutic gene', 'tool', 'trafficking', 'transgene expression', 'tumor', 'viral gene delivery']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,680476
"Ultra-Fast Knee MRI with Deep Learning ABSTRACT Fast, robust and reliable quantitative knee joint MR imaging would be a significant step forward in studying joint degeneration, injury and osteoarthritis (OA). Automation of compositional and morphological feature extraction of the tissues in the knee it is an essential step for translation to clinical practice of promising quantitative techniques. It would enable the analysis of large patient cohorts and assist the radiologist/clinician in augmenting the value of MRI. Automation of several human tasks has been achieved in the last few years by the usage of Deep Learning techniques. With the availability of large amounts of annotated data and processing power, using the concepts of transforming data to knowledge by the observation of examples, supervised learning can today accomplish challenges never demonstrated before. In addition to image analysis and interpretation, Deep Learning is revolutionizing the acquisition and reconstruction aspects of the pipeline. Models can learn a direct mapping between under sampled k-space and image domain. While Deep Learning application to musculoskeletal imaging showed promising results when applied in a controlled setting, it is well understood that generalization beyond the statistical distribution of the training set is still an unmet challenge. In MRI this translates into poor performances when trained models are tested on different imaging protocols or images acquired on different MRI systems. With this proposal, we aim to leverage on this recent advancement and filling the existing gaps. We aim to study novel integrated models able to simultaneously accelerate MRI acquisition and automate the image processing that can overcome the limitation of single domain application. Fast image acquisition and accurate image post processing are typically considered to be separate problems. However, the neural networks optimization design gives us an opportunity to integrate the two to maximize both acceleration and machine-based image processing and interpretation. We will use both publicly available benchmark dataset (FastMRI) and internally collected dataset to build deep learning models able to accurately reconstruct under sampled MRI acquisitions. We will use a dataset prospectively acquired during the course of this study to validate the clinical applicability of the developed methods. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that the proposed integrated pipeline can be applied in clinical setting for a fast and intelligent knee scan obtaining image quality comparable to standard acquisition and automated processing accuracy comparable with human reproducibility. Additionally, we propose to make our annotated image datasets and trained models a shared resource, a centralized, open evaluation platform for MRI reconstruction and image post processing techniques. NARRATIVE This study aims to use Deep Learning to simultaneously accelerate knee MRI acquisition and automate post processing pipelines including multi tissue segmentation, detection and severity staging of osteoarthritis degenerative changes. The proposed study builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize knee MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a first step towards on real time automatic image inspection and personalized imaging protocolling.",Ultra-Fast Knee MRI with Deep Learning,10177641,R01AR078762,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benchmarking', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Knee', 'Knee joint', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Distributions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'Vendor', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'convolutional neural network', 'data space', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'domain mapping', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'heterogenous data', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'joint destruction', 'learning ability', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'research study', 'sensor', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,574344
"Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer Abstract FreeSurfer is a tool for the analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) that has proven to be a flexible and powerful technology for quantifying the effects of many conditions, including numerous neurological disorders, on human brain anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, chemical composition, physiology and function. In the past 20 years, these open source tools have been developed to accurately and automatically segment an array of brain structures and have become the core analysis infrastructure for the Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI). In this project, we seek the resources to radically increase the speed, accuracy and flexibility of these tools, taking advantage of exciting new results in Deep Learning. This will enable us to more accurately quantify neuroanatomical changes that are critical to diagnosing, staging and assessing the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions in diseases such as Alzheimer’s. This includes the generation of documentation, tutorials, unit tests, regression tests and system tests to harden the tools and make them usable by clinicians and neuroscientists, and finally the distribution and support of the data, manual labelings and tools to the more than 40,000 researchers that use FreeSurfer through our existing open source mechanism. In addition, we will analyze the entire Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset and return it for public release, including a set of manually labeled data that can be used to optimize Deep Learning tools for Alzheimer’s Disease over the next decade. Relevance Successful completion of the proposed project will increase the usability and accuracy of our publicly available segmentation tools, and open up new possibilities, such as integrating them into the MRI scanner and rapidly detecting Alzheimer’s-related changes. These new capabilities well enable other studies to significantly increase their ability to detect AD and other disease effects in research settings as well as phase II and phase III clinical trials due to the radical increase in speed of the new tools, enabling them to be applied to a diverse set of MRI contrasts and much larger datasets, rapidly and accurately. Further, they will allow rapid application of cutting-edge analyses to the ongoing Alzheimer’s Disease NeuroImaging Initiative dataset, improving the ability to extract early biomarkers of this devastating disease.",Deep Learning Algorithms for FreeSurfer,10143171,R01AG064027,"['Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Excision', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Label', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Pattern', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phase III Clinical Trials', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'contrast imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cranium', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'early detection biomarkers', 'flexibility', 'high resolution imaging', 'human disease', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'morphometry', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'skills', 'spatial relationship', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site', 'wiki']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,655746
"Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and throughout the world. In 2017, CLD had an age-adjusted death rate of 10.9/100,000 total population and an estimated lifetime cost of fatty liver disease alone in the U.S. of ~$222 billion. Liver fibrosis (LF) is the most important and only histologic feature known to predict outcomes from CLD. The current standard for assessing LF is biopsy, which is costly, prone to sampling error, and invasive with poor patient acceptance. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for noninvasive, highly accurate and precise diagnostic technologies for detection and quantification of LF. Our overarching objective is to apply Deep Learning (DL) methods using conventional non-elastographic magnetic resonance (MR) images, MR elastography (MRE), and clinical data to accurately detect and measure LF in children and adults with CLD, using biopsy-derived histologic data as the reference standard. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts to accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a DL framework to accurately segment liver and spleen in order to extract radiomic (gray-scale signal intensity distribution, shape and morphology, volumetry, and inter-voxel signal intensity pattern and texture) and deep features (complex abstractions of patterns non-linearly constructed throughout the transformation estimated by data-driven DL training procedures) from conventional multiparametric MRI. These features allow detection of liver and spleen structural abnormalities/tissue aberrations. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an “ensemble” DL model (LFNet) to predict biopsy-derived LF stage and LF percentage using the integration of conventional multimodal MRI radiomic and deep features, MRE data, as well as clinical data. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate a DL model (LSNet) to quantify MRE-derived liver stiffness (LS) using conventional multiparametric MRI radiomic and deep features as well as clinical data. The proposed models will help physicians to more accurately detect and follow CLD by 1) quantifying LS from conventional MR imaging without the need for MRE; and, more importantly, 2) predicting histologic LF stage and LF percentage without the need for biopsy, while avoiding inter- radiologist variability, reducing radiologist workload, and ultimately reducing healthcare costs. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data from various scanners and sites. The techniques we develop are expected to improve medical diagnosis and prognostication in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow physicians and researchers to more accurately diagnose and quantify CLD and LF as well as permit more frequent assessments in a noninvasive, patient-centric manner, thus potentially improving patient outcomes while lowering healthcare costs. The techniques we develop also can be readily extended for the prediction of other important liver-related clinical outcomes, including impending complications such as portal hypertension, time to liver transplant/transplant listing, and mortality risk, among others. Project Narrative  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of illness and death worldwide, and it is a significant healthcare and financial burden. Liver fibrosis (LF) is a measurable feature of CLD that is important to assess the severity of disease, evaluate for progression and therapy response, and predict outcomes. We propose to apply artificial intelligence methods to noninvasive conventional magnetic resonance images and readily- available clinical data for accurate detection and quantification of LF, thus significantly impacting public health by facilitating personalized therapies without the need for liver biopsy, improved outcomes, and lower healthcare costs.",Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning,10096229,R01EB030582,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bilirubin', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Making', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fatty Liver', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Portal Hypertension', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling Errors', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spleen', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Vendor', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'accurate diagnosis', 'accurate diagnostics', 'chronic liver disease', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic technologies', 'elastography', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'life time cost', 'liver biopsy', 'liver transplantation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'non-linear transformation', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sex']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,628266
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",10084899,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,616003
"Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI Sensitive imaging biomarkers are urgently needed for screening of high‐risk subjects, determine early disease progression, and assess response to therapies in neurodegenerative disorders. The atrophy of several brain regions is an established biomarker in AD, which strongly correlates with AD neuropathology. The accuracy of subfield volumes and cortical thickness estimated from current MRI methods is limited because of the vulnerability to motion, low spatial resolution, low contrast between brain sub‐structures, and dependence of current segmentation frameworks on image quality. Short motion‐compensated MRI protocols to map the human brain at high spatial resolution with multiple contrasts, along with accurate and computationally efficient segmentation algorithms, are urgently needed tor early detection and management of subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. We propose to introduce a 15‐minute motion‐robust 3‐D acquisition and reconstruction scheme to recover whole‐brain MRI data with 0.2 mm isotropic resolution with several different inversion times on 7T, along with segmentation algorithms that are robust to acceleration. The key difference of this framework from current approaches, which rely on MRI data 1 mm resolution, is the quite significant increase in spatial resolution to 0.2 mm as well as the availability of multiple conteasts. This improvement is enabled by innovations in all areas of the data‐processing pipeline, including acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. These innovations are facilitated and integrated by the model based deep learning framework (MoDL); this framework facilitates the joint exploitation the available prior information, including motion and models for magnetization evolution, with convolutional neural network blocks that learn anatomical information from exemplar data. The successful completion of this framework will yield sensitive biomarkers, which will be considerably less expensive than PET and does not involve radiation exposure. As 7T clinical scanners become more common, this framework can emerge as a screening tool for high‐risk subjects (e.g. APOE, PSEN mutations) and assess progression in patients with short follow‐up duration. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is now a major public health concern with life expectancy at an all-time high. In US alone, the number of affected patients is expected to triple to 13.8 million by the year 2050. This proposal focuses on the development of an ultra-high resolution multicontrast MRI protocol, with the objective of improving the accuracy of brain atrophy rates in early AD subjects. The successful completion of this proposal will yield a biomarker that is sensitive to early brain changes in AD, which can facilitate early detection in high risk population, measure progression, and quantify the efficacy of brain sparing drugs.",Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI,10120861,R01AG067078,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cadaver', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evolution', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive testing', 'convolutional neural network', 'data analysis pipeline', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'direct application', 'entorhinal cortex', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'sex', 'ultra high resolution']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,727486
"Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors Project Summary The overall goal of this project is to develop a new diagnostic tool, called Cyst-X, for accurate detection and characterization of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts and improve patient outcome through precise decisions (surgical resection or surveillance). Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal cancer among all cancers due to its poor prognosis and lack of early detection methods. Unlike other common cancers where precursor lesions are well known (colon polyps-colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors (cysts) are poorly understood. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages may decrease mortality and morbidity rates of this lethal disease. One major approach for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages is to target pancreatic precancerous pancreatic neoplasms (cysts) before they turn into invasive cancer. Once cysts are detected with radiology imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they should be characterized with respect to their malignant potential. Low-risk cysts remain harmless; hence, patients should remain under surveillance program. On the other hand, high-risk cysts can progress into an aggressive cancer, therefore, patients should undergo surgical resection if possible. Despite this, international guidelines for risk stratification of pancreatic cysts are woefully deficient (55-76% accuracy for determining characteristics of low-risk vs high risk cystic tumors, while only 40-50% accuracy detecting cysts with MRI). Combined, these critical barriers indicate that there is an urgent need for improving characterization of pancreatic cystic tumors. Based on our preliminary results, which support the development of an image-based diagnostic decision tool, we hypothesize that our proposed Cyst-X will produce higher diagnostic accuracy for characterizing pancreatic cysts and provide better patient management compared to the current guidelines. Towards this overarching hypothesis, we will first use powerful deep learning methods (specifically deep capsule networks) for automatically detecting and segmenting the pancreas and pancreatic cysts from multi-sequence MRI scans (Aim 1). Next, we will create an interpretable image-based diagnosis model for characterizing pancreatic cysts (Aim 2). Accurate characterization is necessary for such a diagnostic model; however, emphasis will also be placed on interpretability of the machine generated diagnostic model. Visual explanation of the discriminative features will help radiologists obtain higher decision rates in patient management. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed Cyst-X framework in a multi-center study. A total of 1200 multi-sequence MRI scans will be collected from three participating clinical centers (Mayo Clinic, Columbia University Medical Center, Erasmus Medical Center). Comprehensive evaluations will be made to test the validity and generalizability of Cyst-X. All evaluations will be made with respect to the international guidelines and biopsy proven ground truths. Our proposed study has wide implications: specifically, in the long term, it will influence early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and clinical decision making to improve survival rates of pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Unlike other common cancers for which early detection and surgical resection have reduced cancer deaths (e.g. colon polyps for colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors, such as commonly observed pancreatic cysts, are poorly understood. Towards the long-term goal of early detection of pancreatic cancer, our objective in this proposal is to accurately detect and characterize pancreatic cysts before they turn into aggressive cancer. The outcome of this research will be a new diagnostic tool, named Cyst-X, which will establish a better clinical strategy than the current guidelines by recommending a more selective use of invasive testing, surgery, and surveillance.",Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors,10391173,R01CA246704,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Cyst', 'Cystic Neoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial cyst', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'In Situ Lesion', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucinous Cystadenoma', 'Mucinous Neoplasm', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Names', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatectomy', 'Pancreatic Cyst', 'Pancreatic cystic neoplasia', 'Papillary', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serous Cystadenoma', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Visual', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer type', 'capsule', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'detection method', 'detection platform', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'efficacy validation', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome forecast', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'premalignant', 'prognostic significance', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'stem', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,438819
"Fast Multi-dimensional Diffusion MRI with Sparse Sampling and Model-based Deep Learning Reconstruction Project Summary: Neurodegenerative disorders are a significant public health and economic problem and are the leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding the specific degenerative processes that are actively progressing over the course of the illness is crucial for developing targeted drugs therapies and deciding treatment options. Additionally, understanding the structural connectivity changes to tease apart the specific circuitry affected is crucial in developing circuit specific non-invasive brain stimulation therapies. Diffusion- based MRI assays can provide microstructural measures that are highly sensitive to (i) the neurodegenerative processes and (ii) connectivity changes. Advanced modeling approaches can be utilized to further enhance the specificity of the microstructural measures to the underlying neurodegenerative processes. However, their utility is often limited to pure white matter regions. At the typical spatial resolution of diffusion MRI (~2mm isotropic voxel size), significant partial volume effects exist in most brain voxels (e.g., voxels with multiple tissue types, heterogenous fibers with different properties). In whole brain studies, this compromises the specificity of the disease processes identified by the advanced modeling approaches; it also contributes to inaccurate connectivity mapping. Additionally, the diffusion parameter encoding space is currently limited to one or two shells of low b-values (b<2000s/mm2), which limits the unique determination of several relevant microstructural parameters. The main objective of the proposal is the development, validation and clinical translation of a diffusion MRI assay that enable efficient encoding of diffusion parameter space at sub- millimeter voxel resolution for joint microstructure and connectivity mapping in the whole brain. Our overall hypothesis is that the proposed framework can significantly improve the validity of microstructural modeling in most brain voxels. The proposed development will make use of SNR-efficient 3D multi-slab acquisitions. Coupled with time-efficient sparse k-q sampling, the encoding will span over multiple b-shells. To allow the unique determination of several relevant microstructural parameters, multicompartmental T2 information will be utilized. The proposed developments will be enabled by two advanced reconstruction methods: structured low- rank matrix completion, a novel integrative framework for MRI reconstructions that enables several capabilities including multi-echo imaging and self-calibrating reconstruction; and model-based deep learning, a novel deep architecture to solve MR reconstruction algorithms using neural networks in a systematic fashion. These methods overcome several inefficiencies associated with extending the 3D multi-slab acquisition for multi- dimensional imaging in the k-q-TE space. To ensure scientific rigor, we will comprehensively validate our technology on dedicated diffusion phantoms along with healthy volunteers using different quantification metrics. We also validate the capability of the dMRI assay using a multi-modal MRI study in a cross-sectional study on a cohort of Huntington's disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Neurodegenerative disorders are a significant public health and economic problem affecting about 450 million people worldwide are the leading cause of disability and ill-health according to world health organization. The main objective of the proposal is the development, validation and translation of a non-invasive diffusion MRI assay, that enable efficient encoding of diffusion parameter space to characterize the neurodegenerative processes that drive the progression of neurodegeneration.

"A comprehensive deep learning framework for MRI reconstruction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The primary goal of this investigation is to develop and validate a comprehensive, robust deep learning (DL) framework that improves MRI reconstruction beyond the limits of existing technology. The proposed framework uses “plug-and-play” algorithms to combine physics-driven MR acquisition models with state-of-the-art learned image models, which are instantiated by image denoising subroutines. To fully exploit the rich structure of MR images, we propose to use DL-based denoisers that are trained in an application-speciﬁc manner. The proposed framework, termed PnP-DL, offers advantages over other existing DL methods, as well as compressed sensing (CS). Compared to existing DL methods for MRI reconstruction, PnP-DL is more immune to inevitable variations in the forward model, such as changes in the coil sensitivities or undersampling pattern, allowing it to generalize across applications and acquisition settings. Compared to CS, PnP-DL recovers images faster, with higher quality, and with potentially superior diagnostic value. Our preliminary results highlight the potential of PnP-DL to advance MRI technology. In this work, we will fur- ther develop PnP-DL and validate it in these major applications: cardiac cine, 2D brain, and 3D brain imaging. In Aim 1, we will train and optimize convolutional neural network-based application-speciﬁc denoisers for the above-mentioned applications. The denoiser with the best denoising performance will be selected for further investigation. In Aim 2, we will develop and compare different PnP algorithms. The algorithm yielding the best combination of reconstruction accuracy and computational speed will be implemented in Gadgetron for inline processing. In Aim 3, we will compare the performance of PnP-DL to other state-of-the-art methods using retro- spectively undersampled data. This study will demonstrate that, in terms of image quality, PnP-DL is superior to CS and existing DL methods and, despite higher acceleration, is non-inferior to parallel MRI with rate-2 acceler- ation. In Aim 4, we will evaluate the performance of PnP-DL using prospectively undersampled data from adult and pediatric patients. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate that PnP-DL outperforms state- of-the-art methods in terms of image quality while exhibiting a level of robustness and broad applicability that has eluded other DL-based MRI reconstruction methods. The acceleration and image quality improvement afforded by these developments will beneﬁt almost all MRI applications, including pediatric imaging, where reducing sedation is a pressing need, and high-dimensional imaging applications (e.g., whole-heart 4D ﬂow imaging), which are too slow for routine clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many advantages over other imaging methods, but MRI is slow. Addi- tional developments are required to shorten the scan time, improve patient comfort, reduce the use of sedation for imaging children, and improve image quality. In this project, we will develop faster and more accurate methods for MRI. These efforts should lead to signiﬁcant improvements in the diagnosis of different diseases, so that patients may beneﬁt from appropriate treatment.",A comprehensive deep learning framework for MRI reconstruction,10211757,R01EB029957,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Headache', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Network-based', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Recovery', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'computer framework', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'design', 'heart imaging', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'real-time images', 'reconstruction', 'repository']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,613825
"Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI Project Summary/Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool both clinically and in scientific research, with broad applications ranging from cognitive neuroscience to presurgical planning. FMRI can generate whole brain neuronal activation maps, yet it is an inherently low signal to noise ratio (SNR) method due to the relatively small changes in activation signal relative to the baseline signal. The overarching goal of this project is to develop and validate robust, high SNR fMRI by using a novel acquisition method, oscillating steady state (OSS) fMRI, along with machine learning (ML) techniques, to reconstruct high-quality images of the OSS fMRI data. OSS fMRI can increase SNR by >2x compared to the current state-of-the-art in fMRI acquisition methods, and this boost is roughly equivalent to the SNR gain going from a 3T MRI scanner to a 7T MRI scanner. The SNR increase is a direct result of the steady state approach. However, with a more complex, oscillating acquisition, OSS fMRI can be more susceptible to common MRI artifacts than traditional methods if left uncorrected. Two of the most common sources of MRI artifacts are changes in the main magnetic field (B0) due to physiological noise (such as respiration) and patient motion. This project will develop robust, high SNR fMRI at 3T by incorporating the effects of (1) B0 changes and (2) patient motion into the OSS signal model and image reconstruction algorithms. A new image reconstruction that incorporates neural networks will correct for B0 fluctuations and remove B0 induced artifacts. We will train a neural network to generate B0 field maps using data from a conventional, physics-based two echo field mapping technique to implicitly incorporate prior information of the physics into the reconstruction, while also providing a fast, ML-based field mapping method. To correct for subject motion, we will develop a neural network that estimates rigid-body motion parameters from sequential image frames in the fMRI scan. These motion parameters will be used in an iterative image reconstruction to produce high-quality resting-state and task-based fMRI, even in the presence of subject motion. The technology developed in this proposal will result in improved functional MRI that has the potential to significantly advance both the study of the human brain and the treatment of neurological disorders. The University of Michigan is one of the top research universities in the US, and provides an ideal environment and infrastructure to complete the proposed research strategy. The Functional Magnetic Resonance Laboratory and the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at UM have all the necessary hardware and computational resources needed for this project, including two state-of-the-art GE 3T MRI scanners and extensive GPU hardware for the machine learning components of the project. Furthermore, Drs. Jeffrey Fessler and Douglas Noll have proven expertise in fMRI image acquisition and reconstruction, as well as extensive mentorship experience, that will help guide this project and my training. Project Narrative Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to measure brain function, and it has revolutionized our understanding of cognitive processes during the last 25 years and has also been used as a tool for presurgical mapping of language and other sensitive brain regions. More recently, fMRI is being used as a biomarker for the progression of neurologic and psychiatric diseases, for example, in Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and major depression. In this project we will improve fMRI techniques by developing new methods that are more robust to common sources of MRI image degradation, which will improve the sharpness of the fMRI images without increasing instrumentation costs.","Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI",10196983,F32EB029289,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Left', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic Process', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'magnetic field', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'progression marker', 'reconstruction', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2021,66390
"Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) plays an increasing role in guidance of interventional radiology (IR) procedures in the abdo- men, with special emphasis in embolization procedures, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or transarterial embolization (TAE) for control of internal hemorrhage. However, relatively long scan time of CBCT results in artifacts arising from organ motion (respiratory and cardiac motion and peristalsis). This poses a significant challenge to guidance in interventional radiology: for example, motion artifacts were found to render up to 25% of CBCT images un-interpretable in image-guided TACE, and 18% in CBCT-guided emergency TAE. The impact of motion is most significant in cases of single or isolated lesions treated with selective embolization that requires visual- ization of very small vascular structures. Existing motion correction methods often invoke assumption of periodicity, lim- iting their applicability outside of cardiac and respiratory motions, or rely on fiducial tracking or gated acquisition that disrupt IR workflow and/or increase radiation dose. Therefore, the application of CBCT in image-guided interventional procedures in the abdomen would significantly benefit from new methods that estimate complex deformable motion directly from image data. “Autofocus” techniques based on maximization of a regularized image sharpness criterion were shown to yield effective patient motion compensation in extremity, head and cardiac CBCT. However, current applications of such methods are limited to rigid motions. We hypothesize that deformable organ motion compensation in interven- tional soft-tissue CBCT can be achieved with advanced autofocus techniques using multiple locally rigid regions of in- terest, preconditioned with basic motion characteristics obtained through a machine learning decision framework. The following aims will be pursued: 1) Develop a joint multi-region autofocus optimization method to compensate deforma- ble organ motion. This includes incorporation into a comprehensive artifacts correction and image reconstruction pipe- line, design of multi-stage optimization schedules for convergence acceleration, and performance evaluation in deforma- ble phantoms, and cadaver and animal experiments. 2) Develop a decision framework for preconditioning of the motion compensation method through a combination of projection-based approaches for physiological signal estimations (res- piratory cycle) and a multi-input, multi-branch, deep learning architecture trained on extremely realistic simulated data that will estimate basic properties of motion (spatial distribution of amplitude, direction, and frequency) from an initial motion-contaminated image and its associated raw projection data. 3) Evaluate deformable motion compensation in animal experiments and in a clinical study in 50 cases of CBCT-guided TACE and assess image quality via expert observer evaluation of satisfaction and utility. The proposed work will yield a robust, practical method for compensation of deform- able soft-tissue motion in CBCT, removing a critical impediment to 3D guidance in IR. The deformable autofocus frame- work will be applicable to other interventions in which soft-tissue motion diminishes CBCT guidance, such as image-guided radiation therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventional Cone Beam CT (CBCT) provides critical 3D information to guide minimally-invasive procedures in the abdomen, but CBCT image quality is often compromised by organ deformation due to breathing, cardiac, and peristaltic motions. We propose a novel framework to mitigate the effects of this complex deformable motion using only the CBCT image data, without a need for gating, external trackers, or fiducial markers. This algorithm will remove a major impediment to 3D guidance in procedures such as transcatheter embolization procedures in the abdomen.",Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology,10100337,R01EB030547,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Arterial Embolization', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Cadaver', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chemoembolization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Emergency Situation', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Frequencies', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Peristalsis', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate Ablation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'heart motion', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'internal control', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'preconditioning', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'tumor']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,368438
"Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI Project Summary/Abstract Background: Although current MRI performs well as a tool to measure white matter (WM) inflammation in MS, its ability to quantify gray matter (GM) pathology, meningeal inflammation, and chronic inflammatory changes are limited. For this reason, researchers have looked to 7-tesla (7T) MRI for more robust in vivo measures of pathology. Although the increased sensitivity of 7T MRI for these aspects of MS have stimulated much interest, the impact of previous studies have been limited due to small sample sizes, varying methodologies, cumbersome analysis methods, and conflicting results – all of which have limited the generalizability of findings and more widespread dissemination of the use of this tool. Objective: In this study, we aim to advance the use of 7T MRI as a tool for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment effect monitoring by performing multi-site, large sample size evaluation of imaging correlates of cortical and deep GM lesions, chronic active WM lesions (WM lesions with paramagnetic rims on MRI), and meningeal inflammation (leptomeningeal inflammation (LME) on MRI) and validation of their clinical relevance. We also will look develop automated tools for identification and quantification of these findings on 7T MRI. Study Design: Imaging and clinical data will be derived from previous and ongoing studies of the use of 7T MRI in MS performed at multiple collaborative sites under the umbrella of the North American Imaging in MS (NAIMS) Collaborative, including the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Harvard-Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University. This includes data on up to 814 individual persons with MS, 1232 individual study visits, and a follow up period of up to 5 years. GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME will be identified on 7T, with critical evaluation of methods and their relationship to clinical data. Further, the manual analysis results will be used as training sets for deep learning algorithms for identification of these abnormalities on future 7T MRI scans. Impact: This study would provide the data on measurement variability and generalizable clinical importance of the imaging findings being investigated, along with providing automated tools for future, high-throughput studies. In advancing these precise measures of aspects of MS pathology only poorly measured on lower field MRI, this study will lead to more accurate MS diagnoses, improvements in the ability to monitor changes in MS pathology over time, and perhaps lead to the screening of new pharmaceutical interventions to target GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME. Project Narrative In this study, multiple institutions performing research using 7-tesla (7T) MRI research on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) will combine data for a large scale, pooled analysis project. The investigators will refine methods for visualizing cortical and deep gray matter lesions, chronically inflamed white matter lesions, and meningeal inflammation on 7T MRI in MS and will evaluate their clinical relevance on a large scale and develop machine learning algorithms for future identification. It is expected that validating findings on 7T and their clinical relevance along with providing automated tools for analysis will lead to the use of 7T MRI as a more widespread clinical tool, resulting in earlier diagnoses, better prognostication, and more effective treatment monitoring in MS.",Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI,10278178,R01NS122980,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Baltimore', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Maryland', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meningeal', 'Meninges', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Predisposition', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive disability', 'comparative', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'outcome forecast', 'physically handicapped', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,535821
"mIQa: A Highly Scalable and Customizable Platform for Medical Image Quality Assessment - Phase II 1 Project Summary NIH is increasing its investment in large, multi-center brain MRI studies via projects such as the recently announced BRAIN initiative. The success of these studies depends on the quality of MRIs and the resulting image measurements, regardless of sample size. Even though quality control of MRIs and corresponding measurements could be outsourced, most neuroscience studies rely on in-house procedures that combine automatically generated scores with manually guided checks, such as visual inspection. Implementing these procedures typically requires combining several software systems. For example, the NIH NIAAA- and BD2K- funded Data Analysis Resource (DAR) of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) uses XNAT to consolidate the structural, diffusion, and functional MRIs acquired across five sites, and has also developed their own custom software package to comply with study requirements for a multi-tier, quality control (QC) workflow. However, these custom, one-off tools lack support for the multi-site QC workflows that will come with the unified platform that MIQA represents: a design that supports collaboration and sharing, and strong cohesion between technologies. To improve the effectiveness of QC efforts specific to multi-center neuroimaging studies, we will develop a widely accessible and broadly compatible software platform that simplifies the creation of custom QC workflows in compliance with study requirements, provides core functionality for performing QC of medical images, and automatically generates documentation compliant with the FAIR principle, i.e., making scientific results findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.  Specifically, our multi-site, web-based software platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by leveraging open-source, state-of-the-art web interface technologies, such as a web-based dataset caching system and machine learning to aid in QC processes. Users will be able to configure workflows that not only reflect the specific requirements of medical imaging studies but also minimize the time spent on labor-intensive operations, such as visually reviewing scans. Issue tracking technology will enhance communication between geographically-distributed team members, as they can easily share image annotations and receive automated notifications of outstanding QC issues. The system will be easy to deploy as it will be able to interface with various imaging storage backends, such as local file systems and XNAT. While parts of this functionality have been developed elsewhere, MIQA is unique as it provides a unified, standard interface for efficient QC setup, maintenance, and review for projects analyzing multiple, independently managed data sources.  The usefulness of this unique QC system will be demonstrated on increasing the efficiency of the diverse QC team of the multi-center NCANDA study. Narrative The goal of this proposal is to develop a web-based, multi-site, open-source platform for Medical Image Quality Assurance (MIQA) to address the QC needs of geographically diverse teams using small and large medical image-based studies alike. MIQA will enable efficient and accurate QC processing by levering state-of-the-art machine learning, data management, and web interface technologies.

"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies.

"MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers SUMMARY The importance of biomarkers in clinical practice and regulatory science is difficult to overstate. The ultimate goal for clinical care of the future is to determine the most appropriate therapy for each patient’s unique version of a particular disease. This concept of precision medicine has been identified as a national priority in the USA, leading to a need for biomarkers that can provide objective and reproducible information. In addition, regulatory science for the approval of new qualified drugs and medical technologies has an urgent need for qualified biomarkers to report on the success or failure of these drugs and technologies. Imaging biomarkers, providing in situ “biopsies”, have the potential to provide such specific information and, ultimately, to improve routine clinical care and speed up development of new treatments. The overall goal of this Resource therefore is to develop novel noninvasive MRI candidate biomarkers that can ultimately be used for: (i) personalized assessment of patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring; (ii) monitoring of the development of new medical technologies and drugs, i.e. for better guiding of clinical trials. The significance of our proposed developments lies in providing the fundamental design and initial testing (i.e. not clinical trials itself) of new MRI candidate biomarkers with the potential to provide surrogate quantitative imaging endpoints that are as close as possible to clinical endpoints. As such, this Resource will focus on designing, calibrating and standardizing new magnetic resonance (MR) technologies to provide reliable measures across sessions, scanners, and raters. This technology will then be disseminated for larger scale patient studies to allow clinical validation.  The MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary consortium combining facilities and expertise of the F.M. Kirby Research Center at Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI), the Department of Radiology at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Medicine, the Center for Imaging Science at the JHU Whiting School of Engineering, and the Department of Biostatistics at the JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health. We propose 4 TRD projects, 3 on MR acquisition approaches and one bringing them together with advanced multi-scale data analysis methods that include machine learning. To assure a proper choice of technologies, we will interact closely with a group of clinical and research experts in a push-pull relationship through collaborative projects (CPs) that focus on brain diseases, disorders, and injuries that have a need for new quantitative MR technology to better and noninvasively assess them. These include anemia/ischemia and related white matter hyperintensity lesions (CPs 1,5), aging, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia (CPs 2,7,10), traumatic brain injury (CP4), glymphatic function (CP6), pain (CP8) and addiction (CP9). As an initial testbed for our methods, we also have a group of service projects (SPs) to which we will provide both data acquisition methods and data analysis software. Finally, we will train investigators in their use and disseminate methods nationwide and to MRI manufacturers for even broader application. Narrative The MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary consortium combining facilities and expertise of multiple departments and schools at the Kennedy Krieger Institute and the Johns Hopkins University. The goal of this National Center is to develop novel noninvasive MRI candidate biomarkers that can ultimately be used for (i) personalized assessment of patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring (Precision Medicine), and (ii) expediting the development of new medical technologies and drugs. We will provide training in these new advanced technologies, and disseminate them to other research centers and hospitals in the country and worldwide.","MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers",10270096,P41EB031771,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Anemia', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contrast Media', 'Country', 'Critical Pathways', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Industry', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Ischemia', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Technology', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health Schools', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Water', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomarker validation', 'candidate marker', 'candidate validation', 'clinical care', 'clinical outcome assessment', 'clinical practice', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug development', 'glymphatic function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'investigator training', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'medical schools', 'multimodality', 'multiscale data', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'product development', 'prognostic', 'public-private partnership', 'quantitative imaging', 'response biomarker', 'success', 'tool', 'working group']",NIBIB,HUGO W.

"Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease Project Summary: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that has a prevalence of over 800,000 in the US alone. The economic impact is disproportionally high because it affects primarily young individuals. The characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent hospitalizations. There has been a recent shift in clinical practice from a reactive to a proactive CD treatment strategy, recently coined as “treat-to-target”, where patients are treated to achieve not only an initial response-to-therapy, but also longer clinical remissions and improved mucosal healing. However, this approach requires the regular assessment of disease activity using objective markers enabling treatments to be tailored to the individual patient. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new tools to improve diagnostic accuracy, to quantify disease burden, and to monitor treatment efficacy. Our application in response to PAR-19-056, “Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn's disease” is aimed at developing and evaluating noninvasive, contrast and radiation-free quantitative imaging markers for assessing disease activity and for monitoring response to therapy. Currently available non-contrast MR imaging (MRI) sequences such as diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and the calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are attractive but limited in providing robust and reproducible markers. Different imaging protocols or different scanners result in different ADC values. Our primary goal is to develop robust and reliable quantitative DW-MR imaging markers for the non-contrast and non-invasive assessment of CD. The proposed novel MRI acquisition and model fitting techniques will provide measurements of slow and fast diffusion as well as fraction of fast diffusion, as highly accurate, quantitative biomarkers for cell proliferation, density and size, and tissue perfusion—all indices that characterize the extent of disease activity (i.e., inflammation) in the tissue micro-structure of the bowel. To achieve this goal, we will first develop and implement an advanced distortion and motion corrected (DiMoCo) DW-MRI technique and a spatially constrained probabilistic intravoxel incoherent motion (SPIM) model to compute robust and reproducible markers. Next, we will reduce the imaging time with estimated x4 acceleration with an accelerated image acquisition and a new, advanced deep learning-based parameter estimation technique. The proposed imaging techniques and software tools will provide robust quantitative markers, thereby enabling the accurate assessment of CD activity and response to therapy. They will also reduce the need for invasive endoscopy procedures as well as the total number of other tests typically ordered for monitoring disease, effectively reducing both the disease burden and the overall cost of healthcare. Another important goal is to develop and broadly disseminate open source software that will enable the standardized evaluation of other diseases presently evaluated with DW-MRI that would benefit from the advanced diagnostic and assessment capabilities of the proposed DiMoCo SPIM-DW-MRI technique. Project Narrative: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that impacts over 800,000 patients in the US alone, where characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent, costly hospitalizations and symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, general malaise, and fever significantly compromise quality of life. There is a need for new tools aimed at the reliable assessment of disease activity by using objective markers to improve diagnostic accuracy, quantify disease burden, and monitor treatment efficacy, enabling subsequent treatments tailored to the individual patient's disease profile. The primary objective of this project is three-fold: First, to develop and validate a novel, noninvasive, contrast- and radiation-free quantitative MR imaging and image analysis technique, i.e., DiMoCo-SPIM that will generate robust and reproducible imaging markers from DW-MRI that will enable clinicians to more accurately assess bowel inflammation and response to therapy; second, to develop a machine learning technique that reduces the imaging time (x4 acceleration); and third, to make image analysis software developed in this proposal available in multiple clinical domains that presently evaluate various diseases with MRI and would benefit from the improved diagnostic and assessment capabilities of this computationally-driven technique.",Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease,10121764,R01DK125561,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Acceleration', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Coin', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease remission', 'Endoscopy', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Evaluation', 'Fever', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhagic colitis', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malaise', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Respiration', 'Safety', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell motility', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical remission', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diffusion weighted', 'economic impact', 'efficacy evaluation', 'healing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'water diffusion']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,391320
"Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is an enormous clinical problem and worldwide cause of disability. Development of new therapies for OA is hampered by a lack of sensitive imaging tests that respond to changes in disease status. Recently FDA and CE approved clinical knee 7T MRI has the potential to add sensitivity and specificity to advanced MRI biomarkers of OA progression. This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for development of disease-modifying treatments. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using 3T and 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health across different tissues in osteoarthritis.",Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI,10190939,R01EB002524,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Cartilage', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GAG Gene', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Orthopedics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Proteoglycan', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'clinical application', 'clinical examination', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy evaluation', 'efficacy trial', 'imaging approach', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mechanical properties', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'quantitative imaging', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,611185
"Imaging and Analysis Techniques to Construct a Cell Census Atlas of the Human Brain Admin Supplement Abstract The ~86 billion neurons that form the human brain are organized at multiple scales, ranging from the fine details of an individual neuron’s dendritic arborization, to local circuits that are embedded within large-scale systems spanning the brain. In this project, we will image across this vast range of scales to create a multiscale atlas akin to Google Earth for the human brain that can visualize hemisphere-wide networks and then zoom in to see individual, labeled cells at micron resolution in the frontal temporal lobe. This dramatic advance will be made possible through the use of an array of imaging technologies, including light-sheet microscopy (LSM), tissue clearing, immunohistochemistry (IMH), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and newly developed techniques in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). OCT in particular is a potentially transformative technology as it provides micron resolution over large volumes of tissue, images all of the tissue (as opposed to fluorescence), does not require mounting and staining and hence can be automated, and is essentially distortion free as it images the tissue prior to cutting. LSM-based IMH will provide molecular, morphological and spatial properties of cells that will enable us to develop cellular classification systems, while OCT images of the same tissue will enable us to remove the distortions induced by cutting and clearing, and transfer information to whole-hemisphere MRI for atlasing and in vivo inference. This transfer of information depends critically on the ability to register images across a huge range of resolutions and contrast types. For this we propose to use the endogenous fiducial landmarks provided by the cerebral vasculature. To take full advantage of the vasculature using deep learning requires a training set of labeled vessels in each of our imaging modalities across an array of examples. The goal of this supplement is to provide these labelings including the assessment of intra- and inter-rater reliability. Relevance Automated segmentation of neurons, glia, cortical areas and laminar boundaries will enable new and more specific types of analyses of neuroimaging data. In particular, the ability to probe cellular and laminar properties of specific cortical areas may provide significant advances in developmental disorders such as Alzheimer’s, autism, schizophrenia and dyslexia. To facilitate these advances we propose to label cerebral vessels, then use the manual labeling to develop a deep learning-based technique to register images from microscopy to whole-hemisphere MRI.",Imaging and Analysis Techniques to Construct a Cell Census Atlas of the Human Brain Admin Supplement,10307352,U01MH117023,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cerebrovascular system', 'Cerebrum', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Dyslexia', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Planet Earth', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'microscopic imaging', 'neuroimaging']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2021,99916
"Multi-Site Clinical Data to Power MRI Biomarker of Neonatal Brain Injury Abstract This project aims to release our recently gathered existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE affects 1-5/1000 term-born neonates and is a major cause of early-childhood mortality and morbidity. Neonatal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is acquired routinely for the clinical care of HIE. Neonatal brain MRI is expected to reveal 3D neuroanatomic mechanisms of adverse outcomes so that we can design new treatments specifically target those mechanisms. Neonatal brain MRI also carries hope to identify those neonates who are at risk to develop adverse outcomes later in life, so that early intervention program can target those at-risk neonates for maximum benefit. Despite MRI's vital role in caring for HIE, the current norm in clinical practice is to read MRI visually by expert neuroradiologist or neurologist. Expert reads, however, has many limitations – subjective, qualitative, insufficient to reveal mechanisms, and inadequate to predict outcomes. Objective and quantitative analysis of MRI is possible with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical and neuroimaging informatics. A major limitation, however, is the lack of publicly-available data on HIE. Our project aims to fill this gap, by archiving and releasing our clinically-acquired, large-scale (N=231), and multi-site (2 hospitals) data on HIE. Our data was acquired partly funded by NIH R01 (2012-2017) and foundations (2016-2020). Our data is comprehensive, including clinical data elements (from both mothers and neonates), neonatal brain MRI (structural and diffusion sequences), expert-consensus annotation of lesion regions in neonatal brain MRI, NICU outcome (death/survival, length of stay), and 2-year-old neurocognitive outcomes (normal/adverse, yes/no for development dealy, yes/no for the hearing/visual/motor impairment, and yes/no for cerebral palsy). Our data is also representative, coming from patients with different racial/ethnicity groups, in patients with a wide range of outcomes, from different MRI scanners (Siemens 3T or GE 1.5T), with different imaging protocols, and MRI scanned on different days of life. We will also derive new data from existing data. The anonymized (de-identified) data will be released to the NCBI dbGaP platform with the “Controlled Access” option, requiring IRB and data use agreement (DUA). The derived data will be released to dbGaP with the “Open Access” option, freely downloadable without any approval. Both release options are consistent with other clinical and MRI data that have already been released on dbGaP. We hope this first comprehensive data will boost future collaborative efforts for AI to automatically identify HIE lesions in MRI, and for AI to accurately predict HIE outcome integrating clinical and MRI information. Project Narrative We aim to publicly release our existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal brain injury caused by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Our data were retrospectively collected partially funded by NIH R01 (2012-2017) and two other foundational/institutional grant (2016-2020); our data is comprehensive (clinical data from mothers and neonates, neonatal brain MRI with expert-consensus annotations of HIE lesions, and complete set of outcome measures by 2 years of age); our data is representative (MRI scanner, age at MRI, MRI protocol, patient outcomes, patient racial/ethnicity groups); and our data is multi-site (2 hospitals) and large-scale (N=231 compared to proprietary studies with dozens of patients). We plan to use this first public clinical and brain MRI data for HIE to boost artificial intelligence (AI) research for HIE lesion detection and outcome prediction, toward promoting outcomes in this vulnerable neonatal population.",Multi-Site Clinical Data to Power MRI Biomarker of Neonatal Brain Injury,10194889,R03HD104891,"['2 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Authorization documentation', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child Health', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ethnic group', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Hospitals', 'Human Development', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metadata', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Brain Injury', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study of magnetics', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'cranium', 'data access', 'data de-identification', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'early childhood', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention program', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'motor impairment', 'natural hypothermia', 'neonatal brain', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient registry', 'response', 'sex', 'success', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment', 'visual motor']",NICHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2021,94911
