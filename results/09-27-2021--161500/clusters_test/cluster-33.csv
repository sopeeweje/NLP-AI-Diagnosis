"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community. PROJECT NARRATIVE: HERCULES Human health and disease is dictated by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The HERCULES Center is focused on providing a more comprehensive assessment of these environmental influences by utilizing exposome-based concepts and approaches.",HERCULES: Exposome Research Center,10144435,P30ES019776,"['Achievement', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Leadership', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Marshal', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Toxicology', 'Translations', 'Update', 'Vision', 'base', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'operation', 'ranpirnase', 'treatment strategy']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P30,2021,1471985
"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,10122959,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple datasets', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2021,16342
"The Epitranscriptome as a Novel Mechanism of Arsenic-Induced Diabetes. SUMMARY In the United States, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is particularly high among American Indian (AI) communities. Arsenic (As), a pervasive environmental contaminant disproportionately affecting AI communities, may explain this increased risk. Arsenic induces oxidative stress and systemic low-grade inflammation leading to β-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance in target tissues. However, the impact of As on T2DM has been disputed due to a lack of coherent mechanism for these findings. Previous studies have focused on epigenomic mechanisms (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications), overlooking downstream regulatory mechanisms that can more directly shape phenotypes. We propose to investigate the RNA modification N6- methyladenosine (m6A), the most prevalent epitranscriptomic modification on messenger RNA, which is directly involved in the cellular stress response. In experimental systems, arsenic induces a m6A response. m6A also modulates key processes underlying T2DM pathogenesis, including immune response and systemic inflammation. m6A is controlled by a group of proteins called reader, writer, and erasers (RWEs), responsible for adding, interpreting, and removing m6A marks. Fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) is one example of an arsenic-sensitive m6A eraser with strong ties to T2DM and glucose homeostasis. Our pilot study in elderly men exposed to low-level arsenic supported these findings. We propose to test the hypothesis that altered m6A and RWEs are plausible mechanisms for As-related T2DM in the Strong Heart Study (SHS). The SHS is an ongoing longitudinal study in AI communities in Arizona, Oklahoma, and North/South Dakota with detailed clinical data for T2DM and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The SHS has measured speciated As exposure data covering childhood and adult exposure windows, both independently associated with T2DM in previous research. Leveraging the cohort design, exposure and phenotypic data, infrastructure, and study team, we propose to conduct epitranscriptomic analysis of mRNA m6A profiles via m6A sequencing and measure mRNA expression of 20 RWEs using whole blood from 1100 participants at the upcoming SHS follow up visit (scheduled for 2022- 23). Our specific aims are to: 1) determine the association of past and current As exposure with epitranscriptomic profiles of m6A and RWEs mRNA expression levels in blood; 2) determine the association of blood m6A epitranscriptomic profiles with metabolic markers and MetS, clinical T2DM prevalence, and T2DM control (glycated hemoglobin, albuminuria); 3) develop a predictive m6A fingerprint that quantifies the risk of T2DM due to As exposure using machine learning approaches. For aims 1 and 2 we will further use Mendelian randomization to assess causal relationships. Characterization of m6A profiles in a population of AI adults highly impacted by T2DM will reveal biological features linking a pervasive toxicant such as As to diabetes. In addition to leading to interventions to reduce As exposure in the US and globally, defining the roles of m6A and RWEs in T2DM may contribute to new targets for future diabetes therapies. NARRATIVE Increasing evidence supports the role of arsenic exposure in diabetes development. We will evaluate novel epitranscriptomic mechanisms linking arsenic to diabetes and metabolic dysfunction in American Indian communities. This study can provide insight into novel pathways of arsenic related diabetes, identify prevention interventions, and inform recommendations for arsenic levels in water and food.",The Epitranscriptome as a Novel Mechanism of Arsenic-Induced Diabetes.,10140691,R01ES032638,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'American Indians', 'Arizona', 'Arsenic', 'Beta Cell', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Stress Response', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disputes', 'Elderly man', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fingerprint', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Food', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated Hemoglobin', 'Heart', 'Hepatic', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Modification', 'Names', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oklahoma', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Stability', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'South Dakota', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Water', 'Whole Blood', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cohort', 'data infrastructure', 'design', 'diabetes mellitus therapy', 'epigenomics', 'epitranscriptome', 'epitranscriptomics', 'histone modification', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,684582
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10162467,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis', 'venous thromboembolism']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,561787
"The Study of the Environment and Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias (SEAD) PROJECT SUMMARY The rising prevalence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a major public health and clinical challenge in the United States. Identification of ADRD causes to inform prevention and policy is the most efficient way to address these challenges. Most research to date has focused on identifying genetic causes of ADRD, however, recent population-scale studies have shown that environmental exposures, such as lead and cadmium, also contribute to ADRD risk and etiology. Initial findings on environmental factors linked to ADRD risk is promising, but human evidence is limited. A wide range of environmental exposures (exposome) have never been evaluated systematically in relation to incident ADRD. While there is a growing demand to predict future risk for ADRS more precisely, the role of exposomic data in improving ADRD risk prediction has never been evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a prospective cohort study by capitalizing on existing large-scale, United States nationally representative, multi-ethnic population-based data. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, from 1998-2010, n>15,000) has a variety of environmental chemical exposure measurements, behavioral risk factors, and clinical phenotypes, and when linked to Medicare data, provides up to 25 years of incident ADRD. We aim to (1) conduct a biologic hypothesis-based approach to test the associations of chronic exposure to lead and cadmium with incident ADRD; (2) conduct a data-driven environment-wide association study to systematically evaluate a wide-range of environmental toxicants with incident ADRD; and (3) develop and validate an exposome-based risk prediction model for ADRD using machine learning methods. The proposed study will advance scientific understanding on how modifiable and currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants can lead to the development of ADRD. This study assesses the exposome to improve prediction of future disease risk and define vulnerable populations more precisely. This research will highlight individual-level and population-level interventions (i.e. precision health) to effectively prevent or reduce the risk of ADRD in the US population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health and precision health because comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of modifiable environmental exposures, including the currently ubiquitous environmental neurotoxicants lead and cadmium, will advance scientific understanding on the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and inform individual-level and population-level interventions to effectively prevent or reduce the burden of ADRD. The proposed study is directly responsive to the 2018 National Institute on Aging AD Research Summit recommendations related to Understanding the Impact of the Environment to Advance Disease Prevention and Enabling Precision Medicine Research for AD/ADRD, and to the research goal of NOT-AG-18-053, Enabling precision medicine for AD/ADRD through deep molecular phenotyping.",The Study of the Environment and Alzheimer's disease and related Dementias (SEAD),10120924,R01AG070897,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cadmium', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurotoxins', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Strategic Planning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'abeta deposition', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chronic Pb exposure', 'clinical phenotype', 'dementia risk', 'demographics', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'effective intervention', 'environmental chemical', 'environmental chemical exposure', 'follow-up', 'human population study', 'improved', 'lead exposure', 'machine learning method', 'modifiable risk', 'molecular phenotype', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'symposium', 'tau expression', 'toxicant']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,692598
"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures. We will explore the causal effects of orphanhood by comparing children who lost parents in the tsunami with those in the same community who did not. Project Narrative This project will field the fifteen year follow up of the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR), a large-scale longitudinal study of individuals differentially exposed to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The data provide unique information on the evolution of population health of a group of 27,000 individuals first interviewed before the tsunami, including biomarker measurements and integrated information on environmental change.",Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status,10250551,R01HD052762,"['Adolescence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Child Welfare', 'Cicatrix', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Data', 'Disasters', 'Documentation', 'Earthquakes', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Household', 'Imagery', 'Indian Ocean', 'Individual', 'Indonesia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Natural Disasters', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Public Domains', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Rest', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Shock', 'Siblings', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Sumatra', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Tsunami', 'Variant', 'Water', 'acetone hydrazone', 'adverse childhood events', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'environmental change', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'human capital', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'member', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'sea level rise', 'success', 'tool', 'weather patterns', 'young adult']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,498320
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,10176558,R01HL142503,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,775715
"ICEES+ Knowledge Provider: Leveraging Open Clinical and Environmental Data to Accelerate and Drive Innovation in Translational Research and Clinical Care. As part of the feasibility phase of the Translator program, we have developed a disease-agnostic framework and approach for openly exposing clinical data that have been integrated at the patient- and visit-level with environmental exposures data: the Integrated Clinical and Environmental Exposures Service (ICEES). We have validated ICEES and demonstrated the service’s ability to replicate and extend published findings on asthma, while also supporting open team science, accelerated translational discovery, and integration with the broader Translator ecosystem. This proposal aims to move ICEES from prototype to development via creation of an ICEES+ Knowledge Provider (KP). Specifically, we aim to address three major challenges that we have identified through research and development (R&D) of the prototype ICEES in an effort to improve the quality, value, and impact of query answers and assertions. Specific Aim 1. Advance the rigor of insights and assertions that ICEES provides. Our prototype ICEES currently provides the ability to dynamically define cohorts and conduct simple statistical associations to examine bivariate relationships between feature variables. Recently, we have identified an approach to extend the bivariate functionalities to support multivariate analysis of the data. For the proposed work, we will apply multivariate analyses, including traditional statistical methods (e.g., regression models) and machine learning methods (e.g., bayesian neural network models, variational autoencoder models), and systematically quantify the extent of data loss and analytic bounds when algorithms are imposed on the ICEES+ KP open application programming interface (API) versus the Institutional Review Board (IRB)– protected, fully identified, pre-binned, underlying integrated feature tables. The overall goal is to provide users with more rigorous insights and estimates of the robustness, validity, accuracy, and specificity of knowledge and assertions generated via the ICEES+ KP OpenAPI. Specific Aim 2. Address issues related to space–time and causality. Clinical and environmental data are inherently spatiotemporal, with observations or events that are contingent on space and time and may be causally related. For the proposed work, we will evaluate and implement technical approaches (e.g., ICEES+ design modifications), spatiotemporal statistical algorithms (e.g., conditional auto-regression), recurrent neural network models, and causal inference models. As part of this effort, we will derive insights from and contribute real-world evidence to support Causal Activity Models and Adverse Outcome Pathways. We also will explore approaches for incorporating into ICEES+ nationwide public data on school exposures—data that will allow us to begin to address patient mobility. Specific Aim 3. Evaluate the security of the ICEES+ KP to ensure that patient privacy is preserved as new capabilities are enabled. ImPACT is an NSF-funded package of tools and services that provides end-to-end infrastructure and support for privacy-assured research and computation on sensitive data. Over the award period, we will implement and evaluate ImPACT security protocols, focusing initially on application of the ImPACT secure multiparty computation (SMC) algorithm as a method to support secure multi-institutional sharing of data on rare diseases and events—a functionality that is not currently supported by ICEES. In addition, we will evaluate other ImPACT security protocols, working under the guidance of a security advisor and in the context of driving use cases and capabilities developed under Specific Aims1 and 2. Importantly, the project aims will be driven by three use cases and associated high-value queries designed to complement and extend our asthma-focused work on the prototype ICEES: (1) an asthma cohort from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR) at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS); (2) a primary ciliary disease cohort (PCD) from the UNC PCD Registry; and (3) a drug-induced liver injury (DILI) cohort from the National DILI Network. These use cases will invoke new diseases, new data types, new organ systems, new institutions, and new queries, thereby stress-testing the ICEES framework and approach and moving it from prototype to development as the ICEES+ KP. n/a",ICEES+ Knowledge Provider: Leveraging Open Clinical and Environmental Data to Accelerate and Drive Innovation in Translational Research and Clinical Care.,10333478,OT2TR003430,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Bayesian neural network', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Knowledge', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Privacy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress Tests', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'application programming interface', 'autoencoder', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'liver injury', 'machine learning method', 'patient mobility', 'patient privacy', 'preservation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'recurrent neural network', 'research and development', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NCATS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,OT2,2021,982187
"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,10200044,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Bangladesh', 'Birth Weight', 'California', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disadvantaged', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Esthetics', 'Exposure to', 'Geological Survey', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired health', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Micronutrients', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Vital Statistics', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'base', 'contaminated water', 'demographics', 'drinking water', 'econometrics', 'elementary school', 'environmental justice', 'ethnic minority population', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'ground water', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'infant outcome', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'school district', 'socioeconomics', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2021,183893
"CHABMAP (Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analyses Platform) technology automates the quantification of toxic CyanoHABs exposure epochs for any waterbody. Specific Aim #1: Operationalize spatio-temporal CyanoHAB exposure epoch metrics  • Fuse multi-scale and disparate satellite remote sensing platforms and automate retrievals over  space and time to derive CyanoHAB exposure metrics. We will build enterprise software to fully  automate the harmonization and fusion of NASA’s Landsat-8 OLI and ESA’s Sentinel-2 and  Sentinel-3 satellite platforms to provide long-term (1984-present) moderate spatial resolution  (30meter pixels) and high temporal frequency CyanoHAB exposure metrics (Cyanobacteria  Intensity, Color Dissolved Organic Matter, Total Suspended Solids, Floating Algae Index,  Chlorophyll-a Concentration, & toxins). The decision support tool automates epoch synthesis to  understand incubation periods and exposure triggers for neurodegenerative diseases. Specific Aim #2: Scale on-demand CHABMAP commercial product services  • Scale and implement CHABMAP data services for infinite scalability using BigData cloud  technologies. This Aim involves three main development efforts: adapting our proprietary  Geospatial Image and Processing System (GIPS) capabilities to an AWS-deployable auto-scaling  cluster, creation of user interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) to interact with  these services, and enhancements to the base GIPS framework to facilitate intercommunication  between remote GIPS-enabled archives and the cloud processing streams. This includes the  creation of deployable compute instances, optimization of computation and parallelization  specific to AWS deployment, optimization of temporary and long-term storage of intermediate  products, and optimization of communication and data transfer with end users. Ultimately, this  Aim will allow for the assessment and monitoring of CyanoHAB conditions for any waterbody or  region (i.e., North America) on the planet. Specific Aim #3: Execute risk assessment frameworks with public health partners  • We will work in partnership with Cleveland Clinic, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center,  University of Miami, Macquarie University, NIH’s Neuromuscular Diseases Research Section and  CDC’s Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (National ALS Registry) to assess the role  of CyanoHABs exposure as a risk factor for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using patients,  clinic-, and population-based controls across diverse settings and geographies. Each application  end user has ongoing risk assessment frameworks (i.e., Gene-Environment, Residential History  Machine Learning, eco-epidemiological, molecular biology) which our CHABMAP technology will  integrate exposure epoch metrics to understand the etiology or ALS and support drug discovery. Proposed Innovation CHABMAP technology automates the quantification of toxic Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom (CHAB) exposure epochs for any waterbody or catchment in the world for the past four decades using multi-scale harmonized satellites.

"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),10128453,P42ES017198,"['Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidative Stress Pathway', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pesticides', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health Practice', 'Puerto Rican', 'Puerto Rico', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Superfund', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Water', 'Water Purification', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'community involvement', 'contaminant transport', 'contaminated drinking water', 'contaminated water', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data repository', 'data visualization', 'disadvantaged population', 'drinking water', 'experience', 'extreme weather', 'ground water', 'health data', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'new technology', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'portability', 'prenatal', 'recruit', 'remediation', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'superfund chemical', 'superfund site', 'tissue culture', 'toxicant', 'volatile organic compound', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2021,2152873
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,10120729,K23MH113708,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Severities', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical outcome measures', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'statistics', 'theories', 'treatment of anxiety disorders']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,186408
"Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Su H. Chu, PhD, MS is a biostatistician and molecular epidemiologist with strong and substantial commitments to integrative omic research in respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. Her career objective is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing and applying novel statistical methods and multiomic network approaches that facilitate mechanistic understanding of the intersection of respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. This proposal combines Dr. Chu’s extensive training in integrative omic methods development, along with her experience in genetic and metabolomic research, to examine the integrative metabolomic etiology of asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder overlap (AAO). A wealth of epidemiological literature has revealed with remarkable consistency that asthmatic patients are at greater risk for ADHD, and vice versa, with a number of longitudinal studies of childhood asthma indicating excess risk of ADHD in adolescence and adulthood. However, no studies have directly interrogated the biological mechanisms by which these conditions may be related. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that childhood asthma and ADHD share both common and distinct dysregulated metabolic processes, some of which may have drivers that are genetic in origin. This will be explored using existing genetic and metabolomic data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC), three large prospective cohorts of children with extensive longitudinal phenotyping and multiple omic data types, by identifying metabolites and metabolic profiles associated with AAO (aim 1), constructing multiomic models and features that characterize dysregulated metabolic processes and their upstream drivers in AAO (aim 2), and validation and replication of all findings (aim 3). As Dr. Chu completes these aims, her career development program will facilitate the achievement of her primary training goals: 1) increase clinical understanding of ADHD and asthma diagnosis and treatment; 2) gain a nuanced understanding of best methods for, and practical experience in, the biological and statistical integration of genetic and metabolomic data; 3) develop skills in machine learning and integrative network methods for multiomic analysis; 4) strengthen current areas of experience to stay on the cutting edge of new analytic and study design techniques; and 5) enhance skills in mentorship, teaching, and the responsible conduct and communication of research. The support of a diverse mentoring team comprised of world experts in the fields of asthma and psychiatric genetics, metabolomics, integrative omics, and statistics, along with her strong quantitative training and the vibrant intellectual community of Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, ensure the success of this proposal. Finally, this research will use state-of-the-art multiomic techniques to lay the initial groundwork for understanding the pathobiology of asthma and ADHD comorbidity, a major and well-established public health concern, from which new research programs will emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although a rich epidemiological literature has demonstrated a high comorbidity between asthma, the most common respiratory disease worldwide, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common behavioral disorder among children, with reports of significant increases in diagnoses in recent years, no studies have interrogated the potential molecular pathobiology underlying the mutual excess risk between asthma and ADHD. This proposal aims to use integrative techniques by combining genetic and metabolomic data to characterize common and distinct mechanisms and pathways of dysregulated metabolism in the presence of comorbid asthma and ADHD and to develop multiomic profiles which can assist in predicting higher risk of ADHD among asthmatic children. The findings from this study will be instrumental in understanding the molecular underpinnings of two highly prevalent public health concerns, and this study will be the first of its kind to interrogate the molecular intersections between asthma and ADHD.",Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity,10224338,K01HL153941,"['Achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Communication Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Formulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sphingolipids', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tryptophan', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Woman', 'antenatal', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'biological systems', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'method development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychogenetics', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,178200
"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in pediatric obese asthma.",Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility.,10063930,K08AI135091,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allergens', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Response', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interleukin-13', 'Knockout Mice', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'PD-1 pathway', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Activation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Th2 Cells', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Weights and Measures', 'Work', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'antiviral immunity', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'dimensional analysis', 'drinking water', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pediatric patients', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational approach']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K08,2021,186948
"A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage ABSTRACT Infertility and spontaneous abortion (SAB) are significant public health problems, affecting up to 25% of reproductive age couples in the United States. Health care costs attributable to infertility and SAB exceed $5 billion per year, and several studies have shown an association between infertility treatments and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors for subfertility and SAB is an important public health goal. The potential effects of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on risk of subfertility and SAB are understudied. The few existing human studies have limitations including small sample size, enrollment after conception, retrospective study design, suboptimal assessment of exposure and outcome, inadequate control for potential confounding variables, and limited generalizability. The proposed study will prospectively assess the relation of exposure to selected EDCs, including phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), to risk of subfertility and SAB in a preconception subcohort of 950 pregnancy planners. We will use data from two NICHD-supported prospective cohorts of pregnancy planners in North America and Denmark. With web-based recruitment and data collection, we have enrolled over 17,000 women attempting pregnancy into these cohorts. In a subset of 200 participants, we have successfully pilot tested in-person collection of urine and blood specimens during the preconception and early pregnancy periods. In this application, we propose to expand in-person biospecimen collection, increasing the number of women with preconception and early pregnancy urine and blood samples from 200 to 950. At each of our three biospecimen collection sites (Boston, Detroit, and Aarhus), we will enroll 250 women and collect three urine samples and one blood sample (in preconception) and three urine samples and one blood sample (in early pregnancy). We will ship the samples to the CDC for the analysis of urinary phthalates, urinary phenols, and serum PFAS. To increase cost efficiency, we will pool three urine samples in each exposure window before assaying for phthalates and phenols; and we will assay one preconception blood specimen for PFAS, a persistent chemical, in analyses of subfertility and SAB. Finally, we will conduct a pilot study among 100 U.S. participants to assess the feasibility of collecting urine by mail, which would allow us to take advantage of our full geographically-diverse cohort in the future. Strengths of this application include the prospective design, preconception enrollment of pregnancy planners, repeated measurement of exposure during preconception and early pregnancy, excellent control for confounding via bimonthly prospective data collection on a wide range of covariates, and use of the latest analytic methods for mixtures modeling. We have generated compelling preliminary data to support our aims. The present grant is cost-effective in leveraging already-established cohort studies with data collection and follow-up supported by other grants. The results generated will be translatable by directly informing future regulatory decisions about EDC standards in a manner that could reduce rates of infertility and SAB. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nearly 15% of all couples have difficulty becoming pregnant and up to 25% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Infertility and miscarriage can cause profound psychological and financial hardship for those affected, and they account for more than 5 billion dollars in U.S. health care costs each year. Identifying modifiable risk factors for infertility and miscarriage, including environmental pollutants (phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances), is an important public health goal.","A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage",10057270,R01ES029951,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Benzophenones', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Boston', 'Canada', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Conceptions', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cost efficiency', 'Couples', 'Cyclohexanes', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Denmark', 'Dicarboxylic Acids', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Esters', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Financial Hardship', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Infertility', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'North America', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parabens', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phenols', 'Pilot Projects', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Serum', 'Ships', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Sum', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'chemical standard', 'child bearing', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost estimate', 'design', 'early pregnancy', 'early pregnancy loss', 'environmental chemical', 'feasibility testing', 'follow-up', 'health goals', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infertility treatment', 'innovation', 'male', 'modifiable risk', 'phthalates', 'pregnant', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'subfertility', 'time-to-pregnancy', 'trying to conceive', 'urinary']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,601377
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,10078271,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular emergency', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'detection limit', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,513804
"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,10146388,R21ES031740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemically Induced Toxicity', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Wildfire', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'biomass smoke', 'computational toxicology', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'data repository', 'experience', 'exposed human population', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'male', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoke inhalation', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,190241
"Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents Asthma self‐management is essential for preventing exacerbations and reducing the burden of the disease. However, poor adherence to prescribed treatment and poor recognition of symptoms leads to reduced asthma control, particularly among adolescents. Studies show that adolescents lack understanding about self‐management, and that asthma education during clinic visits is deficient, resulting in insufficient asthma management. Mobile technology, specifically, mobile applications (or apps) are an efficient way to increase patient‐provider communication, provide feedback on asthma management, and deliver asthma education. Our pilot work has demonstrated that an app can be effective at improving asthma control in adolescents aged 12‐17, and that adolescents are enthusiastic about utilizing mHealth technologies for asthma management, but that existing apps are not engaging or appealing enough to an adolescent population to sustain long‐term use. For this pilot study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self‐management in order to obtain data necessary to complete a future large efficacy trial of the app in adolescents with persistent asthma. The objective of this project is to use an agile, iterative, user‐centered design process to tailor our existing proof of concept app to adolescent user preferences and to use a mixed‐ methods approach to test feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy. The long‐term goal is to identify mHealth technological approaches that facilitate self‐management of chronic diseases, particularly among adolescents, and to develop marketing strategies to promote long‐term support of these approaches. The rationale for this project is that adolescents are quick to adopt mobile technologies, have a high degree of smartphone use, and are at a point of transition from parental management of their chronic condition to self‐ management, making this a priority population for the development of interventions targeting asthma control. For this project, we have two specific aims: 1) To refine an asthma self‐management app for adolescents with persistent asthma; and 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to the app in a small randomized controlled trial. The approach is innovative because we are incorporating a user‐centered design process to integrate multiple components for facilitating asthma self‐management in a mHealth tool tailored for adolescents within the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Despite studies showing that mHealth tools can be effective, few have prioritized an adolescent audience or evaluated the tool compared to standard of care using rigorous, mixed‐method approaches. This research is significant because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the US and the prevalence of the condition continues to rise, and so innovative tools to improve self‐management of the disease are critically needed. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, which makes the proposed research a significant public health burden. This pilot is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self-management among adolescents with persistent asthma. Knowledge gained from this pilot study will be used to design and conduct a future efficacy trial of the app. This project addresses the mission of NHLBI by developing a novel intervention to treat asthma. This study leverages our formative and pilot work to continue making strides towards enhancing asthma control among adolescents with persistent asthma in order to reduce asthma-related morbidity.",Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents,10224318,R34HL145442,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Information System', 'Hispanics', 'Incentives', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Self Management', 'Smoking', 'Social Change', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age group', 'aged', 'arm', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient-clinician communication', 'peak flow measurement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R34,2021,256469

"IL-18 Signaling and Lung Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Severe Asthma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  Asthma is a common disease, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Though well controlled in most, some experience disease that is refractory to standard treatments such as corticosteroids. Recent efforts focused on understanding these severe asthma (SA) patients suggests ontological heterogeneity. Previous work from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) cohort linked epithelial gene signature to clinical phenotype. We revisited this data set and identified 3 novel groups of asthmatics, one of which housing the majority of SA cases and having the worst lung function and greatest exacerbation history. Using principal drivers of variance in the data set, we found that expression of the interleukin 18 receptor (IL18R1) along with 18 other genes was able identify at-risk asthmatics. IL18R1 has been previously linked to asthma in genome-wide association studies. Its ligand, interleukin-18 (IL-18), may be a cofactor for both Th1 and Th2 inflammation. High IL-18 levels have been detected in serum and sputum of asthmatics including in those with fatal asthma. Importantly, IL-18 and IL18R1 regulate epithelial barrier function in other inflammatory conditions. We have confirmed an increase in IL18R1 at the protein level in SA patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using lung biopsies from very severe asthma cases. These SA patients also harbor increased numbers IL-18+ cells, the cognate ligand for IL18R1. Downstream targets of IL18 stimulation, including the active phosphorylated forms of JNK1 and c-Jun, show increase in SA airway epithelium. SA patients also show disorganization of adherens junctions, suggesting breakdown in epithelial barrier integrity.  Based on this background and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that IL-18 pathway activation, via elevated IL18R1 expression in bronchial epithelium, promotes dysregulated barrier function that contributes to SA pathobiology by increasing immune cell access to foreign antigens. We propose 2 aims to address this: Aim 1. We will interrogate pre-existing tissue banks for quantitative analysis of IL18R1 and compare that with levels of its ligand in tissue and fluids from these patients. These data will be corroborated with activity of associated signaling pathways and tight/adherens junction integrity. Aim 2. We will us primary human airway epithelial cells, obtained bronchoscopically from HCs and asthmatic patients to mechanistically confirm and expand upon the results from Aim 1. This will include validation of ex vivo results as well as quantification of barrier function.  These data will identify a novel role for IL18 in severe asthma pathogenesis and open up new avenues for treatment of this difficult and costly disease. The activities of the project will provide the PI with valuable experience in obtaining, culturing and manipulating primary human airway epithelial cells and lay the foundation for future in vivo work by integrating study in computational biology and immunology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Severe asthma is disease with tremendous impact on patient quality of life and significant cost of treatment. We have used machine learning to identify the IL-18 pathway as a potential driver of this disease which may one day be targeted for novel treatments. Thus, we propose confirmation of these findings using an extensive ex vivo tissue collection as well as mechanistic validation using primary human airway epithelial cells to lay groundwork for future in vivo study.",IL-18 Signaling and Lung Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Severe Asthma,10116175,F32HL147415,"['Address', 'Adherens Junction', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergens', 'Antigens', 'Asthma', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Computational Biology', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'E-Cadherin', 'Electrical Resistance', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'IL18 gene', 'Immune', 'Immunofluorescence Microscopy', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-18', 'JUN gene', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'MAPK8 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sputum', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tight Junctions', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Transcription Factor AP-1', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'airway epithelium', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic airway', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'clinical phenotype', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'genome wide association study', 'in vivo', 'interleukin-18 receptor', 'novel', 'occludin', 'p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'standard care', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2021,52121
"Clinical prediction and epigenetic regulation of asthma and rhinitis Asthma and rhinitis share a strong genetic component and are the most common chronic respiratory diseases worldwide affecting 339 million and 500 million people, respectively. Both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis are well-studied risk factors for the development of asthma, independent of atopy and IgE sensitization, and up to 80% of asthmatics have concomitant rhinitis. Conversely, asthma is also a risk factor for the development of rhinitis suggesting a common pathophysiological link between the upper and lower airways. Individuals with comorbid asthma and rhinitis are more likely to experience frequent and severe asthma exacerbations. Currently, an unmet need exists in the understanding of the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis, including which patients are at risk and why patients with comorbid disease have increased disease severity. microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important predictive biomarkers and regulators of the pathogenesis of asthma and rhinitis. However, the role of miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) regulatory networks in asthma with comorbid rhinitis is not known. The overall hypothesis of this K23 award proposal is that the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis can be predicted by clinical factors and is regulated by miRNA-mRNA networks. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the early childhood clinical prediction of the development of comorbid disease in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiology (BAMSE) cohorts and create a validated clinical prognostic tool to identify high-risk children who may benefit from early monitoring and interventions. Specific Aim 2 will identify the unique miRNA-mRNA pathways and regulatory networks in the peripheral blood that regulate asthma with comorbid rhinitis in children from the VDAART, BAMSE, and Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) cohorts to identify candidate miRNAs and biological pathways that may serve as future targets of miRNA-based therapies and biomarkers. Specific Aim 3 will prospectively validate the miRNA-mRNA signature of asthma with comorbid rhinitis across the peripheral whole blood and local nasal epithelium in subjects recruited from Brigham and Women’s Hospital to identify the shared and tissue-specific pathogenic pathways in the peripheral blood and local primary airway tissue. Through this K23 award proposal, the candidate will complete an integrated plan of mentorship, coursework, conferences, patient-oriented research, statistical and computational analyses, manuscript submissions, and R01 grant preparation.

"Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments Project Summary: My goal is to build an independent research program in the development of causal inference methods for investigating environmental causes of childhood cancer. This K01 will enable me to conduct the focused, intensive research that will lay the groundwork for that program and to acquire the environmental, biological, and epidemiological training needed to maximize the rigor and impact of my work. Research: We propose to develop new causal machine learning (ML) methods that enable rigorous analysis of environmental natural experiments (NE) for estimation of the causal effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer. Classical approaches to studying relationships between environmental exposures and childhood cancer are plagued with challenges and are yielding inconsistent findings. We contend that the recent proliferation of local environmental regulatory programs has created ample relevant NEs, which provide a powerful alternative approach to study these relationships. However, existing methods for NE analysis are poorly-suited for environmental health contexts. In particular, existing methods fail in the presence of rare outcomes like childhood cancer (Aim 1), and they are not able to provide insight into the timing at which children are most susceptible to any adverse exposure effects (Aim 2). We propose causal ML methods that overcome these challenges and apply them to a NE to study the effects of traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia. We also provide open source software implementing these methods (Aim 3). Career Development and Training: Given my extensive prior training and experience in statistics and data science, the primary aim of the training funded by this award will be the acquisition of subject-matter proficiency, which will provide me with the insights needed to create more effective and impactful environmental health methods. Specifically, I will pursue knowledge in the biology and epidemiology of childhood cancer and in environmental health and exposure biology. The training will be achieved through a combination of (1) hands-on collaborative research as described above; (2) intensive cross-disciplinary mentorship, with mentors specializing in environmental health, pediatric oncology, cancer biology and epidemiology, and statistics; (3) carefully-selected coursework in the Departments of Epidemiology, Environmental Health, and Cell Biology at Harvard; and (4) relevant conferences, workshops, and seminars. I will place special emphasis on establishing a network of expert collaborators in all my areas of training. Environment: The Harvard Medical Campus is home to the top research teams worldwide in both childhood cancer and environmental health. Due to Harvard’s position at the forefront of scientific discovery in these fields, its unparalleled resources, its vibrant intellectual atmosphere, and its promotion of collaborative science that integrates knowledge across disciplines, it provides an ideal environment in which to train on these topics. Project Narrative: Decades of research on the relationship between environmental exposures and childhood cancer, relying on classic epidemiologic study designs, has produced a largely inconclusive body of literature, and has generated little robust, actionable evidence to protect children’s health. We propose an alternative methodological approach to this problem, which relies on environmental natural experiments to overcome many of the challenges presented by classic approaches. We develop causal machine learning methods tailored to this setting, which provide a promising new avenue for obtaining robust evidence about environmental causes of childhood cancer, and we apply the methods to study the effects of exposure to traffic-related air toxics on childhood leukemia.",Causal machine learning methods for studying the effects of environmental exposures on childhood cancer using natural experiments,10104187,K01ES032458,"['1,3-Butadiene', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian learning', 'Benzene', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cellular biology', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gasoline', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Outcome', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Work', 'cancer epidemiology', 'career development', 'educational atmosphere', 'environmental agent', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'health application', 'health data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'open source', 'prenatal', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2021,138538
"Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room Visits (SPACER) PROJECT ABSTRACT Asthma impacts more than 25 million adults and children in the U.S. with high associated morbidity and socioeconomic disparities in outcomes. Because effective medications are available to treat and prevent exacerbations of asthma and evidence-based interventions exist to mitigate the impact of harmful socioeconomic factors, early identification of those at highest risk is crucial. However, efforts to predict future exacerbations of asthma have yielded modest results with infrequent inclusion of comprehensive information on social hardships, such as food insecurity and housing instability, or financial hardships, such as difficulty affording the costs of controller medications which is particularly relevant for those with private health insurance. Identifying social and financial hardships requires broad-based screenings which are resource intensive, difficult to implement in clinical settings and often incomplete or limited to care seeking populations. Further, few asthma risk prediction modalities incorporate time-variable (temporal) data on important social, clinical, and environmental factors. Machine learning, an advanced computational approach to risk prediction, has great potential to improve upon conventional approaches to risk prediction of asthma exacerbations through indirect estimation of social hardships and inclusion of temporal risk factors. Implementation of enhanced asthma risk-prediction models in a health plan setting offers distinct advantages due to existing investments in asthma care management and access to timely claims data across the full care continuum. Accordingly, the aims of the SPACER study (Sociomarkers to Predict Asthma Control and Emergency Room visits) are 1) To describe social and financial hardships in privately insured adults and children with asthma, and association with medication adherence and exacerbations, 2) To indirectly estimate self-reported social and financial hardships using routinely collected health plan and spatial data, and 3) To develop and validate a machine learning network model, incorporating temporal sociomarker, clinical, and environmental data, to predict asthma exacerbations in a health plan setting. The research leverages the unique research environment of the Department of Population Medicine, an academic research department of Harvard Medical School, situated in a regional non-profit health plan, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The mentored career development award will support Dr. Alon Peltz, a physician and health services researcher, in developing expertise in machine learning modeling and use of social data to improve prediction of adverse clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE The objective of this proposal is to develop new methods for asthma risk prediction in a health plan setting by incorporating social and financial hardship data, temporal features, and machine learning. Applications of this research will directly enable U.S. health plans to better identify adults and children for enrollment in asthma care management programs in order to moderate their combined clinical and social risks for poor asthma quality.

"BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",BRINGING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS TO BEAR ON ENVIRONMENTAL MIXTURES,10304211,R01ES028819,"['Address', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Censuses', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cox Models', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'North Carolina', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pollution', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Sulfur Dioxide', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'early childhood', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'indexing', 'lead exposure', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'pollutant', 'programs', 'rural environment', 'simulation', 'social', 'social stress', 'social stressor', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'urban setting', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME,R01,2021,487253
"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health.

"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,10132972,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serology', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Vibrio cholerae infection', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'diarrheal disease', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'lateral flow assay', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'serosurveillance', 'serosurvey', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,663407
"Applying and advancing modern approaches for studying the joint impacts of environmental chemicals on pregnancy outcomes Preterm birth is a significant public health challenge due to increasing rates over time, as well as serious consequences for infant mortality, childhood morbidity, and economic costs to society. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain unclear, though an influence by environmental chemical exposures is suspected but poorly understood. Establishing links with common environmental chemicals could have huge public health impact since many exposures could be modifiable through remediation, policies or other interventions. Low birth weight and fetal growth restriction also represent a great public health challenge, as they too have increased in recent decades and may be influenced by modifiable exposures to environmental chemicals. This project proposes to leverage the established Boston Lifecodes cohort study (N~4,000) of risk factors for preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, with a focus on exposure to mixtures of commonly-encountered chemicals. We propose to select 1,000 singleton births from Lifecodes with detailed information and samples collected at multiple times during pregnancy. We will then utilize state-of-the-art methods to estimate biomarkers of exposure to chemical mixtures (per- and polyfluorinated substances [PFAS], phthalates and phthalate replacement chemicals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH], and metals/metalloids), in addition to intermediate biomarkers of effect and repeated ultrasound measures of fetal growth, in order to provide much needed human data on environmental and other predictors of pregnancy outcomes and insights on the biological pathways involved. Results from our preliminary work show that oxidative stress may be an important link between exposure and outcome that needs to be explored in more depth using the proposed pathway-specific biomarkers. To accomplish our aims we will develop innovative statistical and machine learning approaches for analyzing mixtures and mediation with high-dimensional mediator sets, with the goal of improving our ability to discover and define these relationships. Finally, a study sub-aim is to identify conditions/activities contributing to high exposures that can inform exposure reduction strategies. The expected outcomes of this study are new and much needed information on the magnitude, sources, and impacts of exposure to commonly encountered chemicals, both individually and in combination, among pregnant women, and innovative methods for identifying relevant biological pathways and assessing health impacts from exposure to mixtures. Our findings will have a significant impact on public health given widespread exposure to the target chemicals, the growing need to identify environmental agents that adversely impact pregnancy, and the need to discover contributors to the high rates of preterm birth in the U.S. and beyond that could be prevented. Our study will also provide new information on the role of oxidative stress in adverse pregnancy outcomes which may inform future therapeutic or preventative interventions, and contribute new statistical and machine learning methods for investigating mixtures, mediation, and birth outcomes.

"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies.

"An Agent-Based Modeling Platform for Environmental Biotechnology Hazardous pollutants in the environment continue to threaten public health and environmental  safety. Human exposure to major contaminant classes, such as polyfluorinated compounds  (PFCs), hazardous organic compounds (HOCs), and heavy metals, has been linked to a variety of  diseases and is subject to stringent State and Federal environmental regulations.  Bioremediation is a low-cost and environmentally friendly approach with many successful  use-cases; however, conventional bioremediation technologies can suffer from unreliability, low  degradation rates, and incomplete degradation. As stakeholders to Superfund sites and other sites  with water or soil pollution urgently demand more efficient, less costly and more reliable  remediation technologies, it is critical to look to advancements in computational  modeling to develop next-generation, precision-engineered bioremediation technologies. The proposed project builds on successful outcomes from Phase I in which a new computational  platform was designed and validated to accurately predict the bioremediation kinetics of  a multi-organism microcosm degrading a combination of HOCs in groundwater. The basis of  this platform is an approach called agent-based modeling (ABM), where the functions of  individual components (e.g. microorganisms) within complex ecosystems are used to predict and  optimize system-level properties (e.g. bioremediation kinetics). In this Phase II project, the novel computational platform developed in Phase I is  further improved with a machine learning component that leverages bioinformatics  databases to develop rationally tailored microbiomes for degrading complex pollutant  mixtures. Iterative experimental validation of model outputs is conducted using an innovative  materials science platform that maintains the relative concentration of different species in the  microbiome constant within the multi-zone treatment barrier (in-situ) or multi-zone bioreactor  (ex-situ). The project includes focused development of a prototype for one bioremediation use-case,  which is directly compared to a conventional (non-precision) bioremediation system treating   actual contaminated groundwater. This will be performed in order to assess and quantify  the expected technical and economic benefits of harnessing the project's novel computational  platform in biotechnology development. The broad, long-term impact of the proposed project will be to transform the development and  implementation of bioremediation by integrating advancements in computational modeling, machine  learning, bioinformatics, and materials science. By leveraging novel tools across disciplines, the  project will accelerate the development of more precise, reliable and inexpensive technologies for  environmental remediation. The successful outcome of the proposed project will also provide new  collaborative opportunities for industry and academia to more rapidly address the remediation of  high-priority pollutants in the environment, and ultimately help mitigate the effects of hazardous  pollutants on communities impacted by the presence of environmental contamination. PROJECT NARRATIVE Contaminated soils and waters continue to threaten public health and safety. This project builds on the development of a novel computational platform for predicting the complex, dynamic interactions between microbial ecosystems and hazardous contaminants-of-concern in the environment, and to utilize this information to develop improved engineered remediation biotechnologies.",An Agent-Based Modeling Platform for Environmental Biotechnology,10158243,R44ES026541,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Biodegradation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bioreactors', 'Bioremediations', 'Biotechnology', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Enzymes', 'Exposure to', 'Ginkgo biloba', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heavy Metals', 'In Situ', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Municipalities', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Side', 'Site', 'Soil', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Water Pollution', 'base', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'design', 'economic evaluation', 'enzyme pathway', 'exposed human population', 'ground water', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'materials science', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pollutant', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'soil pollution', 'success', 'superfund site', 'tool']",NIEHS,"MICROVI BIOTECH, INC.",R44,2021,630992
