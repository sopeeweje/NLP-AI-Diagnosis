"Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition Project Summary The septohippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in multiple cognitive Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains, including memory, attention, anxiety, and sensorimotor processing. This circuit is comprised primarily of the medial septal nucleus (MSN), hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pharmacological and genetic models targeting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction within this circuit result in memory deficits, difficulty with attention, and social interaction impairments. Therefore, we are studying the relationship between MSN-mPFC- hippocampal oscillatory activity in NMDA receptor hypofunction models to better create treatments for disrupted theta and gamma oscillations which are altered in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be one such promising treatment modality for circuit disorders. This NIMH K08 Career Development Award will provide the necessary foundation for Darrin J. Lee, MD, PhD to pursue the development of novel DBS techniques for septohippocampal circuit disorders. The project and training plan are rooted in the electrophysiological and molecular underpinnings of NMDA receptor hypofunction, while concomitantly enabling the candidate to collaborate with and learn from his mentors and consultants. This program will enable him to supplement his current skillsets in areas where he has identified gaps in his knowledge base, including relevant research methodology, study design, machine learning, and structural connectivity. The proposed research will focus on 1) characterizing neural oscillations within the septohippocampal circuit in two complementary models of NMDA receptor hypofunction (pharmacological: chronic MK-801 administration and genetic: parvalbumin interneuron-selective NR1 knockout); 2) evaluating the cognitive effects of DBS in these rodent models, and 3) evaluating the relationship between electrophysiological biomarkers and behavior using machine learning. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of specific electrophysiological aspects of impaired brain function in septohippocampal circuit disorders and serve as a catalyst for a research program centered on neuromodulation for these disorders. Moreover, data collected, skills procured, and collaborations developed will enable Dr. Lee to seek R01 funding and obtain career independence. Taken together, the data collected, and training developed will ultimately facilitate development of an investigator with unique skills in service of ameliorating suffering caused by septohippocampal circuit disorders. Project Narrative Current treatments for psychiatric disorders with deficits in cognitive and emotional Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains have limited efficacy, necessitating more effective treatment strategies. Disorders with NMDA receptor hypofunction lead to septohippocampal circuit dysfunction and circuit-specific cognitive dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) alters focal and diffuse networks and has recently been posited as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. This project aims to evaluate the the role of electrophysiological networks involved in NMDA receptor hypofunction and utilize DBS to improve cognitive behavior.",Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition,10161859,K08MH121757,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'MK801', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Medial Septal Nucleus', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'N-methyl-D-glutamate', 'NR1 gene', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pacemakers', 'Parvalbumins', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'basal forebrain', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'effective therapy', 'functional restoration', 'genetic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prepulse inhibition', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'septohippocampal', 'skills', 'targeted biomarker', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K08,2021,196326
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10226122,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotional functioning', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,706855
"Discovering the molecular genetic principles of cell type organization through neurobiology-guided computational analysis of single cell multi-omics data sets ABSTRACT Understanding the biological principles of cell type diversity and organization is necessary for deciphering neural circuits underlying brain function. The recent rapid accumulation of single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic data sets provides unprecedented opportunity to explore the molecular genetic basis of cell type identity, diversity, and organization. However, analysis of multi-omics datasets have been largely driven by statistic methods that typically do not engage the deep knowledge of neurobiology and developmental biology. As such, most statistic methods do not distinguish technical noise and methodological biases from biologically relevant signals and relationships, and have limited power in achieving biological discovery and insight. Neurobiology guided feature selection based on inherent physiological and developmental processes is essential to move beyond simple statistical clustering of molecular types towards achieving multi-modal definition of neuron types and revealing their inherent relationships as a taxonomy. We have discovered that transcriptional architectures of synaptic input/output (I/O) communication may underlie the essence of cortical GABAergic neuron identity. We hypothesize that transcriptional architectures of synaptic communication is a general defining feature for brain neuron types. We will test this hypothesis by performing a series of supervised learning and feature selection analyses of publically available and emerging single sc-transcriptomic data sets across brain areas and systems from the BRIAN Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN). We further hypothesize that cell type transcriptional signatures of synaptic communication is orchestrated by well-defined gene regulatory programs rooted in epignomic landscape. We will test this hypothesis by joint analysis of sc-transcriptome, ATACseq, and DNA methylome dataset of the same cortical cell populations from BICCN to identify co-expressed gene signatures that reliably define cell identity, focusing on signatures of synaptic communication. Based on transcriptomic and epigenomic architecture of synaptic communication, we will further develop neurobiology guided feature selection algorithms to improve and refine the current statistical clustering the cortical transcriptomic types. In addition, we will generate web portal tools for automated classification of transcriptomic cell types. Our study will establish a unified paradigm of neuronal cell type organization in which epignomic landscape configures core gene regulatory programs to shape synaptic communication properties that define cardinal neuron types. Together, this work will establish a molecular genetic framework for understanding neuronal diversity and achieving a biological classification across brain areas and mammalian species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the biological principles of neuronal cell type diversity and organization is necessary for deciphering neural circuits underlying brain function and disorders. We will develop and apply supervised machine learning – based algorithms to the analysis of the rapidly accumulating single cell molecular genetics data sets across the mammalian species from the BRAIN Initiative.

"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10204729,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data repository', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,639861
"Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit Abstract The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated, well-timed movements. The cerebellar cortex seems to have a particular role in learning to time movements. Since the 1960's and 70's, we have known the architecture of the cerebellar microcircuit, but most analyses of cerebellar function during behavior have focused on Purkinje cells. Here, we propose to investigate the cerebellar cortex at an entirely new level by asking how the full cerebellar microcircuit – mossy fiber, granule cells, Golgi cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells – performs neural computations during motor behavior and motor learning. We strive to “crack” the circuit by identifying all elements, recording their electrical activity during movement and learning, and reconstructing a neural circuit model that reproduces the biological data. We will use three established learning systems that all can learn predictive timing: classical conditioning of the eyelid response (mice), predictive timing of forelimb movements (mice), and direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements (monkeys). Our proposal has six key features. First, optogenetics (in mice) will link the discharge of different cerebellar interneurons during movement and learning to their molecular cell types. Second, a machine-learning clustering analysis (in mice and monkeys) will find analogies among the cell populations recorded in our three preparations and will classify neurons according to their putative cell types based on recordings of many parameters of non-Purkinje cells during movement and motor learning. Third, multi- contact electrodes will allow us to record simultaneously from multiple neighboring single neurons and compute spike-timing cross-correlograms (CCGs) to identify the sign of connections; we also will look for changes in CCGs that provide evidence of specific sites of plasticity during learning. Fourth, gCAMP imaging of the granule cell layer will reveal the temporal structure of inputs to the cerebellar microcircuit, and determine whether those inputs are modified in relation to motor learning. Fifth, a model neural network with realistic cerebellar architecture will reveal a single set of model parameters that will transform the measured inputs to the cerebellum in our three movement systems to the measured responses of all neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Sixth, the model will elucidate how mechanisms of synaptic and cellular plasticity at different sites in the cerebellar microcircuit work together to cause motor learning. Project Narrative The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated and well-timed movements. A better understanding of how the cerebellar circuit works and learns will be important for improving human health in cases of stroke, neuro-degenerative motor disease, developmental motor disorders, and adult movement disorders.",Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit,10155611,R01NS112917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brush Cell', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Forelimb', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smooth Pursuit', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'commune', 'design', 'experimental study', 'eyeblink conditioning', 'eyelid conditioning', 'granule cell', 'improved', 'learned behavior', 'mossy fiber', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1275271
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,10132411,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'rabies viral tracing', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,403711
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,10142533,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2021,843511
"Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT How the brain generates the correct number of neurons and how these neurons determine the size of their arbors to innervate the receptor field is a critical question in neurobiology. The Drosophila visual system is hard wired and iteratively organized into columns, providing an excellent model to answer these questions. Drosophila medulla multicolumnar neurons exhibit 5 to 750 neurons per cell type; each neuron class possesses a distinct morphology and projects its arbors across multiple columns in the optic lobe. The host lab has obtained single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data that determined the transcriptome of almost all optic lobe neuron cell types throughout development. The first aim of this project is to understand the molecular and cell biological mechanisms that dictate neuron number. Under the mentorship of Claude Desplan at New York University (K99 phase), I will perform genetics experiments that decisively address the role of programmed cell death, neural stem cell division number, and neuroepithelial size of origin in regulating the number of multicolumnar neurons produced. I will also perform lineage tracing experiments to determine whether molecularly similar cell types are generated at the same time. With Holger Knaut at NYU Medical Center, I will learn quantitative live imaging techniques to distinguish whether neural stem cells divide a limited number of times to generate low-abundance neural classes, or whether cell fusion of immature progenitors drives cell number. The second aim of this project is to determine the morphological and genetic processes that dictate the size and orientation of the arbors of multicolumnar to allow them to cover distinct receptor fields. With the bioinformatics expertise of Itai Yanai at NYU Medical Center, I will perform RNAseq on adult neurons that are not numerous enough to be identified in our existing scRNAseq data sets. I will then use machine learning algorithms to identify these neurons during development in our existing scRNAseq libraries and thus identify candidate genes required for the regulation of neuron number and arbor size (R00 phase). I will combine these molecular experiments with live imaging to quantitatively characterize how multicolumnar neurons determine the orientation and size of their arbors. Preliminary data indicates that cell death and the size of neuroepithelial region of origin in part dictate multicolumnar neuron number; I have also identified a neuropeptide whose function is essential for the regulation of neuron arbor size. My work will clarify the molecular basis of neuron abundance and determine how neurons present in small numbers regulate their arbor size to ensure that their environment is uniformly sampled, a problem common to many brain regions in most species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how neurons are generated in the correct numbers and how they appropriately space their arbors is of relevance to the fields of developmental neurobiology, neurology and regenerative medicine. Failure to properly specify or target neurons may cause congenital neurological diseases, and our work may identify molecular targets used for treatment. Comprehension of how neurons are made and how they target is also of relevance to regenerative medicine, as stem cell therapies will soon be able to generate diverse neural types which may be transplanted to treat blindness, brain injury and neurodegeneration.",Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size,10104237,K99EY032269,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Death Inhibition', 'Cell fusion', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Ganglia', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inhibition of Apoptosis', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroepithelial', 'Neurology', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neuropil', 'New York', 'Optic Lobe', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photoreceptors', 'Population', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Transcript', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'developmental neurobiology', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroblast', 'neuroepithelium', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinotopic', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'somatosensory', 'stem cell division', 'stem cell therapy', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'two-photon']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,140333
"Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit Abstract Since Ramon y Cajal, neuroscientists have speculated that even the most complex brain functions might even- tually be understood at the level of neuronal cell types and their connections. More recently, while we have be- gun to understand the wiring principles of cortical microcircuit in rodents at the level of cell types, we are still in infancy in understanding the circuit organization of the primate neocortex at the level of cell types and their connections, slowing the progress toward a mechanistic understanding of complex cognitive capabilities char- acteristic of primates. For instance, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of the primate brain is the most evolutionarily developed brain region that supports complex cognitive processes characteristic of primates, such as reasoning, planning, and abstract thinking. However, we know little about the constituent cell types comprising DLPFC circuit, how each cell type connects each other to form a functional circuit, and what circuit components specific to this circuit endow it with superb computational capabilities for complex cognitive pro- cesses. To fill in this knowledge gap, we scale up a cost-effective, interdisciplinary approach to macaque DLPFC, aiming at identifying all its consitiuent cell types and decipher their connectivity rules, with emphasis on highly diverse GABAergic interneurons. We propose to use multi-cell patch recordings, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), novel and rapid viral GABAergic labeling, and machine learning to achieve two main goals: 1) dissect macaque DLPFC microcircuit by generating a morphological taxonomy of cell types in DLPFC and mapping their connections; and 2) derive transcriptomic signatures of morphologically defined DLPFC neurons using Patch-seq method, a novel scRNA-seq protocol. We have demonstrated the feasibility and suc- cess of this approach in mouse neocortex, and our preliminary data indicate no technical issue in applying this approach to primates. Using multi-cell patch recordings, we will characterize electrophysiology and morphology of thousands of neurons and map connections between tens of thousands of cell pairs from DLPFC. Using Patch-seq method, we will combine patch recording with a novel/sensitive scRNA-seq method (Smart-seq2) to simultaneously obtain electrophysiology, morphology and transcriptome from single neurons, which can further substantiate cell type classification and identify novel molecular markers for each cell type. We will prioritize our effort on superficial layers of DLPFC, but eventually scale up our efforts to all layers if time permits. At the end, the project will uncover a high-resolution microcircuit blueprint of macaque DLPFC with each circuit com- ponent identified by specific genetic markers. Such a comprehensive dataset will provide the essential ground- work to design molecular tools for further functional dissection of the complex cognitive processes subserved by PFC. From a clinical perspective, having reference transcriptomes and connectivity patterns for different cell types in primate DLPFC will facilitate our understanding of the relationship between disease-associated genes, cell types, and circuit deficits in neuropsychiatric diseases, schizophrenia in particular. Narrative The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the primate is the most evolutionarily developed brain structure mediating complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates, such as reasoning and planning, while its malfunction is associated with devastating neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer disease. Despite its vital importance, we currently know very little about the constituent cell types populating the primate PFC and how they are wired together to mediate complex cognitive functions characteristic of primates. We propose to use a cost-efficient, multidisciplinary approach to decipher the cell type-specific wiring principles of the monkey PFC circuit at an unprecedented scale and level of detail, which could lead to a better circuit-level mechanistic understanding of complex functions subserved by primate PFC and more effective strategies for the treatment of devastating disorders, such as schizophrenia.",Deciphering the building blocks of the macaque prefrontal cortical microcircuit,10150484,R01MH120404,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Felis catus', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Guns', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Injections', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physical shape', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Scheme', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Work', 'cell type', 'cognitive capacity', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'cortex mapping', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'molecular marker', 'multimodality', 'neocortical', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'patch sequencing', 'preservation', 'scale up', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'ward']",NIMH,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,401250
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,10199070,U19NS107466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2021,2989579
"Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema, which is a common consequence of multiple brain insults, including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury, stroke, metabolic derangements, and seizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures, and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long- term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema, which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead to water accumulation during cytotoxic edema, a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries of the newborn, resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures. Once the pathways are identified, there is the potential for significant advancement in the treatment of neuronal swelling, which is currently lacking.

"Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach. Project Summary Males and females elicit aggressive behavior for resources and survival. Male aggression has been well studied in many species. However, not much is known about female aggression. Recently, my work identified a small female- specific subgroup of cells in the pC1 brain region (pC1α neurons), that triggered females to fight at extremely high intensity levels when activated. For the K99 phase, I will build on my previous work and elaborate on the pC1α neurons circuitry under the mentorship of Dr. E. Kravitz, a well-renowned expert in aggression and Drosophila genetics. Aim 1 is concerned with determining the pre- and post-synaptic partners of the pC1α neurons. For this aim, I will work with my co-mentor, Dr. R. Wilson, to determine pre- and post- synaptic partners and design transgenic fly lines to target these areas. Based on my preliminary data of electron microscopy tracings, I hypothesize that, a)SAG neurons provide inputs to pC1α neurons; and b) pC1α neurons project dendritic outputs to PVL04om_pct neurons in areas previously identified in aggression such as Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum. I anticipate that both up- and down-stream pC1α neurons partners will induce high intensity female aggression. Aim 2 will investigate the role of candidate aggression-associated genes in pC1α neurons. I will train in single-cell profiling methods (used by the Kravitz lab) and address the hypothesis that genes overexpressed in male aggression mediating neurons also play key role in pC1α neuron function. In collaboration with co-mentor Dr. B de Bivort, I will also use neural network-based body part tracking software to train a classifier to automatically label aggressive behaviors. This will allow me to use machine-learning algorithms to capture multi-dimensional representations of the phenotypic differences among fly lines with mutations and transgenic effectors that target aggression circuits (e.g, activating and inhibiting a neuron or overexpressing aggregating proteins). The trainings acquired in my mentored K99 phase will facilitate my transition to independent research studying age-related diseases and behavior. Severe behavioral disturbances of aggression and agitation have been reported to be increasingly common during the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.The reasons for this are completely unknown. Moreover, there is a dearth of understanding of how changes in neurons, during neurodegeneration, lead to specific behavioral defects. For the R00 phase, I will shift my focus to looking at aggression in neurodegenerative disease models and begin my efforts by elucidating the contribution of neuronal protein aggregates of Aβ-42 to aggression. My preliminary data indicates that overexpression of human Aβ-42 in using a (pan-neuronal driver) in males and (cholinergic driver) in females induces heightend levels of aggression. Based on these findings, I hypothesize Aβ-42 overexpression induced aggression is due to altered excitability of key aggression promoting neurons. I plan to use diverse and integrative systems approaches (learned from my mentored phase). I will lead a multi-pronged research effort to understand the mechanisms by which neurons regulate their normal function in the presence of an aging and or neurodegenerative disease state and how these changes affect circuit pathways and ultimately aggression. Project Narrative Aggression accompanies a number of common human neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and other related dementias), with little understanding of how cognitive and aggression symptoms may be linked at the neuronal level. Aggression has been extensively studied in males of many species, but neglected in females (likewise, the interaction of sex and age is neglected). The objective of this research program is to identify the neural circuitry that governs female aggression (K99- mentored phase) and later transition (R00- independent phase) into discovering mechanisms of dementia-related pathology and how these changes affect aggression.",Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach.,10192224,K99GM141449,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Female', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Instinct', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'PC3 cell line', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical aggression', 'Play', 'Population', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Senile Plaques', 'Social Behavior', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'bullying', 'cholinergic', 'cholinergic neuron', 'common symptom', 'connectome', 'design', 'extracellular', 'fighting', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal excitability', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein aggregation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,100000
"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined.

"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist.

"Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution Project Summary The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction. Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors. It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry. Altered neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is a key feature of virtually all human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. We will engineer, validate and disseminate optimized genetically encoded sensors for visualizing neuronal communication with enhanced depth and resolution using advanced microscopy techniques. Combined with optogenetics and calcium/voltage imaging, applications of these tools will reveal the full richness of neuromodulatory signaling to greatly extend, and potentially transform, our understanding of how neurochemical inputs influence cell and circuit function in health and disease.",Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution,10166304,U01NS120820,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Effectiveness', 'Endorphins', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fishes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photometry', 'Photons', 'Property', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental change', 'extracellular', 'fly', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'minimally invasive', 'monoamine', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nerve supply', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2021,869559
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,10093973,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38255
"Mechanisms for internal models in a cerebellum-like circuit Project Summary/Abstract Predicting the consequences of action is a vital function of the nervous system. The hypothesized neural substrate are so-called internal models that transform information about outgoing motor commands and the current sensory state into predictions of sensory input. Such internal models are likely critical for a wide range of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions and their disruption has been implicated in neurological disorders such as autism and schizophrenia. Nevertheless, it has proven challenging to understand how internal models are implemented in neural circuits in the mammalian brain. Our prior studies were successful in developing a detailed mechanistic understanding of how neurons in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish predict and cancel out the sensory consequences of a simple behavior--the electric organ discharge (EOD) pulse. However, because these studies were performed in immobilized animals, the nature of the predictions studied was limited in scope and complexity. This renewal uses novel methods for neural recording and high-resolution behavior monitoring in freely swimming fish to study the more complex internal models underlying the remarkable active electrolocation abilities of electric fish. Computational modeling approaches will be used both to rigorously define the problem facing the active electrosensory system and to generate and test realistic circuit-level models of how they may be solved. The key components of such models, including synaptic plasticity, recurrent and feedforward connectivity, and biophysical compartmentalization of axonal and dendritic spikes, are common to many neural systems including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and neocortex. Hence insights from these studies are expected to be widely relevant to understanding how internal models are implemented in neural systems. Project Narrative Although the ability of the nervous system to predict sensory input is critical for accurate perceptions, coordinated movements, and normal cognitive function, detailed accounts of the underlying neural circuitry and plasticity are lacking. This proposal addresses this challenge by applying novel experimental approaches and theoretical modeling to an advantageous model system where neural correlates for learned predictions are highly accessible to mechanistic investigation. The detailed circuit-level models we plan to develop will provide a foundation for understanding how disruptions of predictive mechanisms contribute to neurological disorders.",Mechanisms for internal models in a cerebellum-like circuit,10206425,R01NS075023,"['Address', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Electric Fish', 'Electric Organ', 'Electrodes', 'Electrostatics', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fishes', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immobilization', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mormyridae', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Posture', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spinal Cord', 'Swimming', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,538626
"Multiple climbing fiber innervation of Purkinje cells in the adult cerebellum The architecture of brain circuits plays an essential role in understanding their function. The discovery of principal concepts in physiology and neurocomputation critically depends on the availability of precise morphological knowledge. A prominent example supporting this notion is the cerebellum, a brain circuit that is involved in motor (and non-motor) control and adaptation. At the center of cerebellar circuits are Purkinje cells, projection neurons that receive thousands of excitatory synapses, which convey sensory information needed for proper motor control. A hallmark feature of these unique neurons is that they have a massive dendrite that is innervated, in the adult brain, by one climbing fiber input. The climbing fiber plays a crucial role in theories of cerebellar supervised learning, and within this conceptual framework provides an instructive signal (here an error signal) guiding plasticity at parallel fiber synapses. More recent studies have, in addition, pointed out roles in reward signaling and noted that climbing fiber-evoked complex spikes occur in response to a variety of sensory stimuli and may also carry motor command signals. These activity-dependent complex spikes are observed in addition to spontaneous complex spikes that occur at an average frequency of about 1Hz. Thus, while we do not know what the exact functions of climbing fiber signaling are, it is obvious that this unusual input provides a core element of cerebellar cortical circuits and to some degree will define its operations. Our discovery – presented here as pilot data – that a subgroup of the entire adult Purkinje cell population (~15%) has two climbing fiber inputs instead of just one, that two inputs are almost exclusively observed in Purkinje cells with two primary dendrites (either separately exiting from the soma, or separating in close proximity to it) and that within this subgroup 20-25% of Purkinje cells show two climbing fiber inputs, leads to the question whether there is a functional significance of this double innervation. Is persistent double climbing fiber innervation of adult Purkinje cells a bug or a feature? In this exploratory study, we plan to examine the basic phenomenon further and to assess whether two separate climbing fiber inputs may signal independently. If the answer to our ‘bug or feature’ question is ‘feature’, we will examine consequences for cerebellar function (e.g. behavioral learning tests) in subsequent studies that we will seek separate funding for. The first aim uses patch-clamp recordings from mice in combination with confocal microscopy in vitro to test the hypothesis that the persistence of multiple climbing fibers is not random, but occurs in Purkinje cells with two primary dendrites. We will also inject tracer dyes into the inferior olive to stain climbing fibers and anatomically confirm the existence of two climbing fiber inputs. The second aim will add calcium imaging in vitro to examine whether a double climbing fiber input leads to functionally separate, dendritic calcium signaling domains. The third aim uses GCaMP6f-based two-photon imaging from Purkinje cells in awake mice to assess whether under spontaneous conditions, or with sensory stimulation, two climbing fiber inputs may operate independently. The microarchitecture of the cerebellum is highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, with the innervation of adult Purkinje cells by a single climbing fiber input as one of its signature characteristics. Pilot studies from our laboratory show that, in contrast to this assumed connectivity pattern, a sizeable subgroup of Purkinje cells with specific dendrite characteristics is innervated by two climbing fiber inputs, thus challenging the traditional view that one dendrite-wide instructive signal, provided by one climbing fiber input, guides the cerebellar control of motor and cognitive functions. Using patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings from Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices as well as two-photon recordings from awake mice, we plan to investigate consequences of double innervation, in particular the question whether two climbing fiber inputs may signal independently.",Multiple climbing fiber innervation of Purkinje cells in the adult cerebellum,10315621,R21NS124217,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Signaling', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Dendrites', 'Development', 'Dyes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Evolution', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Flowcharts', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Injections', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Olives - dietary', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Subgroup', 'Synapses', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Tracer', 'Visual', 'awake', 'base', 'cognitive function', 'in vivo', 'male', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nerve supply', 'neuronal cell body', 'operation', 'patch clamp', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'sex', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R21,2021,451000
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,10207798,R01NS104892,"['Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'squid axon', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,386750
"Deciphering principles of network dynamics underlying depression symptom severity from multi-day intracranial recordings in patients with major depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and causes significant disability world-wide. While typically responsive to medications and therapy, there remain a subset of patients who are treatment resistant. Novel approaches are critical to treat these patients. MDD is likely caused by dysfunction in distributed neural networks, a perspective consistent with the etiological and diagnostic heterogeneity of this disorder. While imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) have helped identify MDD circuitry, no consensus has been reached on the identification of diagnostic biomarkers. Furthermore, the dynamics of MDD circuitry in relation to symptom severity is unknown. Characterization of circuit signatures that define MDD symptom severity states and the extent to which these circuits are modifiable using electrical stimulation are critical for therapeutic advancement.  Intracranial EEG (iEEG) offers a high spatial and temporal resolution method to study depression networks. For the first time, we have an unparalleled opportunity to study such circuits in MDD patients participating in a clinical trial of personalized responsive neurostimulation for treatment resistant depression (PRESIDIO). In stage 1 of this trial, participants are implanted with 160 electrodes from 10 sub-chronic intracranial leads across 10 brain sites for 10 days. The goal of this parent study stage is to optimize brain-site targeting for deep brain stimulation. In this proposal, we will leverage the opportunity to study MDD circuit principles from cortical and deep brain structures over a multi-day time period.  In an ancillary study to this parent clinical trial, we propose a set of experiments that establish basic principles of network dynamics underlying MDD from direct neural recordings. This proposal is organized around the principal concept that brain circuit dysfunction is reflected in abnormal signatures of functional connectivity and rhythmic local-field activity. This concept is supported by our pilot work where we found evidence of distinct MDD networks characterized by functional connectivity and spectral activity. Furthermore, in the first parent trial participant we successfully mapped MDD circuits at the individual level and found that gamma power in the amygdala could successfully decode mood state (AUC = 86%). This proposal builds on these preliminary findings in two aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize state-dependent functional connectivity and spectral activity in relation to symptom severity. In Aim 2, we will examine the manner and time course in which targeted electrical stimulation acutely modifies circuits. Together, this research will yield the first characterization of connectivity and activity dynamics in MDD over a multi-day period from direct neural recordings. This rare insight into MDD circuity provided by this novel dataset establishes proof-of-concept principles for biomarker development and therapeutic target selection that could critically advance personalized MDD treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The characterization of circuit dynamics underlying mood states in major depression and the acute modifiability of circuit features is an innovative and poorly understood area of research. Using an unparalleled dataset of invasive multi-day neural recordings from 160 contacts in patients with major depression who are taking part in a clinical trial of closed loop deep brain stimulation (PRESDIO trial), we seek to identify a set of neural connectivity and activity features that characterize symptom severity states, and to determine whether circuit features can be acutely modified by brain stimulation.

"Circuits underlying threat and safety Classical conditioning has been studied in many different animal models, and even in humans. However, the larval zebrafish with its transparent brain offers a unique opportunity to observe large scale changes in synaptic structure that accompany this form of learning. Accordingly, we have developed a novel paradigm for visualizing synaptic changes that occur during classical conditioning in larval zebrafish. Using this paradigm we have observed striking region-specific changes in the distributions of synapses that drive the rewiring of neural circuits that mediate threat responses. In this grant we will expand this paradigm by monitoring neuronal activity through imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators throughout the pallium (the homolog of the amygdala) before, during and after classical conditioning and extinction. This will allow us to identify cells that comprise the circuits that control threat and safety and explore their connectivity using optogenetics. We will investigate how different sensory inputs can cause changes in the activity of those cells leading to synapse change, and the formation or extinction of associative memories. A crucial component of these studies will be the recording of field potentials to capture rhythmic activity throughout the pallium and high speed SPIM imaging of genetically encoded voltage indicators to record rhythms in individual cells. By understanding the precise timing of signals that impinge on individual cells we will uncover mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity. Our goal is to develop a theoretical model describing the neural circuits that underlie threat detection and how they can change as a result of associative memory formation and extinction. The research proposed in this grant is aimed at characterizing essential circuits in the larval zebrafish that control threat and safety.

"Dissociable neural mechanisms of reactive versus appetitive aggression Project Summary  Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Human aggression is typically demarcated as exhibiting either reactive (defensive) or appetitive (rewarding) components, and a growing literature indicates they are heavily influenced by dysregulation in amygdalar or reward circuitry, respectively. Despite a significant clinical awareness of the fundamental differences between these aggression presentations, direct preclinical characterization of their relative circuitry and associated neuronal mechanisms are currently absent. Therefore, the aim of my proposal is to obtain the obtain the necessary computational, behavioral and anatomical training to identify, interrogate, and manipulate neural populations that modulate these disparate aggressive behaviors.  This project will focus on identifying lateral septum (LS) circuit and cell-type specific mechanisms that control of reactive versus appetitive aggression, and then further interrogate the afferent projections driving these populations. The choice of this brain region is based on converging preliminary data, including my own, implicating that the LS may confer opposing roles in regulating appetitive versus reactive aggression. The circuit and cell-type specific activation of the LS will be identified using a combination of Fos (a marker of neuronal activity) immunohistochemistry, multiplex in situ hybridization, and retrograde viral tracing. Because of the limited temporal resolution of Fos during these behaviors, awake-behaving fiber photometry recording will be used to observe how LS neurons encode these types of aggression in real-time. Next, the causal significance of the LS and its afferent projections will be examined using region, circuit, and cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations. Understanding the neural mechanisms driving these types of aggression will allow for the development of more specific and effective treatments for maladaptive aggression presenting comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Despite a long-standing knowledge of the deleterious effects of maladaptive aggression, current treatment options are largely used as pharmacological restraints rather than targeted therapies. The aim of this proposal is to seek out and establish new mechanisms underlying reactive and appetitive aggression, possibly revealing novel therapeutic targets with higher efficacy and decreased off-target effects.",Dissociable neural mechanisms of reactive versus appetitive aggression,10150355,F31MH125587,"['Acute', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pharmacology', 'Photometry', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Administration', 'Social Behavior', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Viral', 'Wireless Technology', 'awake', 'base', 'cell type', 'comorbidity', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'increased appetite', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'neuroethology', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'restraint', 'reward circuitry', 'serial imaging', 'social', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2021,43944
"The Human Foveal Connectome The complex relationship of cone photoreceptor cells with retinal circuits, Müller glia, and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is essential to normal vision. Yet for the cones in the very center of the fovea that mediate peak visual acuity these relationships are poorly characterized. A longstanding barrier to a comprehensive understanding of cellular and subcellular foveal structure is the myriad interactions among a great diversity of cell types embedded and miniaturized within a complex three-dimensional architecture. The broad long-term objective of this new research program is to elucidate foveal microstructure directly by application of new methods of volume electron microscopy (connectomics). We will utilize retinal tissue acquired from an innovative organ donor program that will permit pre-recovery optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging to assess retinal health status and foveal pit morphology and to guide connectomic reconstruction. Preliminary data from two donor eyes demonstrates feasibility of complete reconstructions of foveal cones and their associated synaptic pathways, Müller cells, and RPE cells. The first reconstructions of cone microcircuits from an adult born preterm indicate that the critical cells and synaptic pathways for foveal vision differ dramatically in structure and localization anticipated from previous work on non-human primates. Therefore in Aim 1 we propose to localize, identify and reconstruct quantitatively the synaptic visual pathways that arise from the central-most foveal cones. We will characterize all of the bipolar and ganglion cell circuits arising from these cones and test the new hypothesis that the dominant “midget” pathway subserving spatial acuity may be highly variable across individuals in both circuitry and pit localization. We will further test the hypothesis that beyond the midget circuit the foveal center gives rise to over twenty distinct but as yet uncharacterized visual pathways. The first reconstructions of Müller cells revealed the intimate wrapping of cone axons and abundance of processes in the plexiform layer and foveal floor. In Aim 2 we propose complete reconstructions of Müller cells to test the hypotheses that the foveal floor contains a novel Müller cell type restricted to inner retina and that morphology of individual Müller cells and their foveal distribution accounts for the macular pigment distribution. The first reconstructions of RPE cells provided new insights on the distribution of organelles important in clinical OCT and autofluorescence imaging. Therefore, in Aim 3 we propose to reconstruct and enumerate organelles in RPE cells in the cone-only fovea and the mixed rod-cone perifovea. We will directly test the hypothesis that RPE organelle content and distribution differs between cone-only fovea and rod-rich perifovea, accounting for the appearance of OCT bands and for topography of autofluorescence signal in clinical imaging. This proposal combines expertise and innovation in neurobiology, pathology, imaging, and connectomics. Outcomes will impact retinal neurobiology, clinical image interpretation, and pathophysiology of macular diseases, especially age-related macular degeneration. The human fovea is essential for best vision but understanding the crucial cellular interactions among photoreceptors, neural circuits and supporting non-neural cells in the foveal center is limited because the extremely miniaturized and complex three-dimensional structure and synaptic organization of this region is difficult to untangle with conventional methods. The proposed project will apply new methods of volume electron microscopy (“connectomics”) to reconstruct the human fovea for the first time. Outcomes will have broad significance for retinal neuroscience, clinical image interpretation, and the pathophysiology of macular disease, especially age-related macular degeneration.",The Human Foveal Connectome,10089446,R01EY028282,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Apical', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological Process', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cone', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye', 'Female', 'Floor', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipofuscin', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Melanosomes', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Mitochondria', 'Morphology', 'Muller&apos', 's cell', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Organ Donor', 'Organelles', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Photoreceptors', 'Pigments', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rod', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Structure of retinal pigment epithelium', 'Supporting Cell', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Vertebrate Photoreceptors', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Pathways', 'Work', 'cell type', 'clinical imaging', 'connectome', 'density', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'fovea centralis', 'ganglion cell', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'macula', 'male', 'miniaturize', 'neural circuit', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'postsynaptic', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'visual performance']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,452171
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,10159320,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,384007
"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",10201782,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Postural adjustments', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2021,587128
"Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism, including: excitation to inhibition (E/I) imbalance, hyper- or hypo- connectivity profiles, abnormal processing along the cortical column, increased variability of sensory encoding, failure of “canonical” cortical computations, and others. Nevertheless, we currently lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. This critical knowledge deficit needs to be corrected. Identifying common themes of neural circuit dysfunction in autism would yield new targets for intervention, potentially opening new windows for restoring function. Methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MECP2) duplication syndrome is caused by duplication of the MECP2 gene, leading to progressive intellectual disability and autism in males with 100% penetrance. It is the “mirror image” of Rett syndrome, caused by loss of MECP2 function. Abnormal synaptic plasticity and E/I imbalance have been causally implicated in both MECP2-disorders and autism in general and are known to affect cortical function. Notably, we and others have shown that visual function is abnormal in MECP2-syndromes. Visual cortex, a prototypical “low level” sensory area, renders itself optimally for studying cortical sensory processing. Here, we mount a comprehensive effort to understand how sensory processing fails in MECP2-duplication syndrome, by studying the visual cortex. Recent advances will allow us for the first time to map densely, at single cell resolution, the functional properties and connectome of a cortical column, one of the fundamental modules of cortical computation, in the MECP2-duplication mouse model of autism (aim #1). This will be followed by a detailed electro-physiological connectivity analysis of the cortical circuit to probe underlying mechanisms (aim #2). Data obtained will be used in conjunction with deep learning techniques to create a sophisticated neuro-realistic model of the cortical circuit, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it (aim #3). Hypotheses formulated “in computo” can then be tested optogenetically, closing the loop. Expectations: 1) Obtain the first comprehensive picture of how early sensory processing fails in this model of autism. 2) Identify specific sub-network connectivity defects reflecting abnormal interneuronal connectivity and E/I balance, 3) Construct a neuro-realistic model of the cortical microcircuit, which can be used to uncover “in computo” the mechanism of dysfunction and to probe how one might intervene to repair it. Finally, we will 4) develop a systematic framework, within which to categorize cortical processing and dysfunction in autism. In the future, additional models of autism will be brought into this fold to be categorized and systematically studied. Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders. Nevertheless, we currently lack a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. Here we undertake an effort to densely map cortical circuit properties and connectivity in the MECP2-duplication syndrome of autism and use this information to create a neuro-realistic cortical circuit model, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it. 1",Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism,10121643,R01NS113890,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Cortical Column', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'MeCP2 Duplication Syndrome', 'Methods', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Sensory', 'Slice', 'Stimulus', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'deep learning', 'design', 'excitatory neuron', 'expectation', 'functional restoration', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'repaired', 'therapeutic target', 'two-photon', 'visual processing']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694774
"Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning Reward learning is a fundamental cognitive function, and the brain has a dedicated neuromodulatory system – based on dopamine – that supports this process. Changes to the dopamine system that are triggered by exposure to drugs of abuse are thought to underlie the behavioral changes observed in addiction. Here we propose to use a treasure trove of previously recorded neural data from throughout the mesocorticostriatal circuitry that supports reward learning, to elucidate the computational role of each component of the circuit, their interactions, and how these components are affected by cocaine. Our brains constantly generate predictions about what rewards might be available, and compare these predictions to actual outcomes. The neuromodulator dopamine is thought to report these ‘prediction error’ signals, the result of the ongoing comparison between expected and obtained rewards, that are key to updating predictions so they are more accurate in the future. Predicting the timing of rewards, and not just their identity or value, is an important component of this process, but it remains a mystery how the brain forms and uses predictions about time in reward learning. Based on a novel theoretical model we recently developed, we will test the computational role of three key brain areas that comprise the brain circuit critical for reward learning, using a state-of-the- art methods from machine learning to jointly decode the learning processes that drive neural activity from multiple brain areas along with behavior as rats perform a reward learning task. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that neural activity in the orbitofrontal cortex is uniquely important for representing high level ‘task states’ and will test for patterns in OFC neural activity that follow the hidden structure of the task. In Aim 2, we will decode the representation of reward predictions about the amount and timing of rewards, and test whether they are separable in VS neural activity. In Aim 3, we will test how activity in VS and OFC controls dopamine activity, and in particular how each input component enables prediction errors to be temporally precise. In Aim 4, we will test how exposure to cocaine changes neural activity that represents reward predictions in the VS, and the impact of this disruption on dopamine prediction errors in the VTA. This innovative multi-level study will leverage numerous existing neural and behavioral data from rats performing a well-validated reward-learning task, to reveal the computational, neural and behavioral mechanisms of the reward prediction and learning circuitry in the brain, and the source of their disruption in addiction. Dysfunction of mesolimbic and corticostriatal circuitry is implicated in addiction, and is known to produce critical deficits in timing (for example, impulsivity) and reward learning. Here we will use a treasure trove of 8 existing datasets to test novel predictions about the neural basis of timing and reward learning, employing state-of-the-art tools from machine learning to ‘decode’ reward predictions jointly from multiple brain areas and from behavior, in intact neural circuits as well as after damage from lesions or exposure to cocaine. Our findings will lay bare the neural computations that support reward prediction and will allow us to link aberrant reward learning in addiction back to its basis in the circuitry of the brain.",Decoding the dynamic representation of reward predictions across mesocorticostriatal circuits during learning,10153745,R01DA050647,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Back', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Behavioral Model', 'Brain', 'Cocaine', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'International', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Update', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive function', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'dopamine system', 'drug of abuse', 'experience', 'frontal lobe', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward circuitry', 'synergism', 'theories', 'tool']",NIDA,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,283500
"Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits Behaviors such as action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging due to the involvement of multiple brain areas and due to the fact that such behaviors involve multiple timescales, from the granular level of moment-to-moment limb control to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. Modern experiments, which are able to record from large numbers of neurons in behaving animals, and in some cases to do so simultaneously in multiple brain areas and throughout the learning of a task, are providing a path forward for addressing these challenges. The overall goal of my research is to facilitate the synthesis and understanding of data from such experiments by constructing models of the brain circuits relevant for a given behavior, addressing how the neural activity in these circuits relates to behavior and how it is shaped over time through learning. In recent work, I have developed expertise in learned dynamics in neural circuits through three related lines of research. First, I have modeled the neural computations underlying timing-related behavior and its implementation in the basal ganglia. Second, I have mathematically derived biologically plausible learning rules to underlie supervised learning of time-dependent tasks in recurrent neural networks. Finally, I have worked on a theory-experiment collaboration in which modeling with recurrent neural networks was used in tandem with brain-machine interface experiments in monkeys to address the structure of neural representations within primary motor cortex. In future work, I will build on this experience to address how dynamical neural activity patterns are learned in order to produce complex behaviors over both short and long timescales. One way to begin addressing this question is with the theory of reinforcement learning, which provides a rich and powerful framework for addressing how actions should be performed in order to maximize future rewards. Given their established role in implementing reinforcement learning, the basal ganglia form the starting point for my proposed research program. I first aim to revise the classical model of basal ganglia function by constructing and mathematically analyzing models that solve computationally challenging tasks and by comparing the results with new data from my experimental collaborators (Aim 1). Building on this work, and making use of my prior experience training recurrent neural networks to model motor tasks, I will next consider learning in motor cortex and how it complements learning in basal ganglia (Aim 2), again comparing models with new experimental data. Finally, I will construct models of the thalamocortico-basal ganglia circuit by incorporating knowledge about the neural representations throughout this circuit and by leveraging recent advances in machine learning. In this way I will address how the mammalian brain implements hierarchical reinforcement learning to integrate behaviors over short and long timescales (Aim 3). Taken together, this research will advance understanding of how neural activity facilitates action selection and sequencing in complex behaviors. Behaviors involving action selection and action sequencing require the shaping of dynamical neural activity patterns through learning. Understanding how such learning occurs is challenging because multiple brain areas are involved and because such behaviors may involve multiple timescales, from low-level limb movements to the cognitive level of goal-driven planning. By developing circuit models of the basal ganglia and their cortical inputs, using new data from my experimental collaborators to inform and test these models, and drawing on recent advances in reinforcement learning from the field of machine learning, I will advance the understanding of how learned motor behaviors are implemented in the brain.",Reinforcement learning and action sequencing in subcortical and cortical circuits,10296960,R00NS114194,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dimensions', 'Dopamine', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'brain machine interface', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'limb movement', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'motor behavior', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neural network', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'supervised learning', 'theories']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R00,2021,249000
"Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.  We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior (which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action. In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior. A central goal of neurobiology is to reveal how the brain generates and organizes action, but we lack sophisticated tools for objectively and comprehensively characterizing behavior. We have developed a next- generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brain organizes behavior; however, using this approach requires substantial expertise, which has slowed its adoption by the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code, and to offer hands-on training, so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily use MoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes, drugs or neural activity changes action.","Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis",9902565,U24NS109520,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Educational workshop', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'data format', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'natural language', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'next generation', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'skills', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'voltage', 'web services']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U24,2021,466672
