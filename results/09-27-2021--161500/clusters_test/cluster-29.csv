"The Neuroscience of Everyday World- A novel wearable system for continuous measurement of brain function Innovations in human neuroimaging tools have driven profound advances in our understanding of brain function under well-controlled and constrained conditions. While we are gaining greater understanding of how the brain functions in single-snapshot experiments under restricted lab settings, we do not know how it works in dynamic, complex and multisensory real-world environments. The goal of this project is to build a portable, miniaturized, lightweight, high-density wearable combined – functional Near Infrared-Spectroscopy (fNIRS) – Electro-Encepholography (EEG) - Eye-tracking system for enabling “Neuroscience of the Everyday World (NEW)” by permitting long duration continuous monitoring of normal / altered brain activity during movement, perception, and social interaction in real time and in the real world. In Aim 1, We will (A) develop a wearable and fully hybrid high-density EEG-fNIRS system that supports autonomous long-term recordings (>6 hours), (B) develop combined and miniaturized active EEG-Electrodes / fNIRS-Optodes; and (C) integrate the wearable system with Tobii Pro 2 eye-tracking/scene-camera glasses and state- of-the-art computer vision for adaptive acquisition and automated data annotation. In Aim 2, we will measure brain activity during walking, perceiving, and interacting, with experiments gradually increasing in complexity through three phases from lab to real world settings in young healthy adults and conduct a proof of principle in two sample clinical populations. In Aim 3, we will create an analysis workflow for data collected in Aim 2 that will accomplish the following: (1) removing nuisance signals from fNIRS/EEG signals, (2) analysis of multimodal fNIRS/EEG and behavioral data, (3) automatic annotation of and adaptation for real world measurements. This project brings together engineers, scientists and clinicians with the goal of building the next generation of imaging tools to capture brain function in real time. With our technological sophistication, interdisciplinary focus, and ready access to well-characterized clinical populations, we are uniquely positioned to successfully develop, apply, and disseminate our NEW technology, and lay down a foundation upon which groundbreaking advances in our understanding of the links between brain activity and behavior will build. There is a need to link brain activity to human movement, perception and cognition, and social communication in real time, and in the Everyday World. This project aims to develop a multi- modal wearable functional neuroimaging device to study brain function in freely behaving healthy subjects and to track the breakdown of normal brain function potentially revealing brain patterns that are signatures of these conditions.",The Neuroscience of Everyday World- A novel wearable system for continuous measurement of brain function,10263915,U01EB029856,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Stroke', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Walking', 'Work', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'frontier', 'hemodynamics', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light weight', 'millisecond', 'miniaturize', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurofeedback', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'signal processing', 'social communication', 'tool', 'visual tracking', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),U01,2021,1000000
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,10135813,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,298890
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI.

"Monitoring Lower Limb Movement to Predict Ambulatory Ability after Spinal Cord Injury After a spinal cord injury (SCI), clinicians must quickly decide where to focus therapy time to maximize an individual's functional mobility by discharge: either towards gait training or wheeled mobility interventions. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can assist clinicians in making those difficult decisions, but literature has shown that for individuals with moderate impairments, current CPRs that use age, strength, and sensation are not sufficient in predicting independent ambulation. Further, existing CPRs do not provide insight into clinically important descriptive measures of gait quality, efficiency, and endurance that contribute to functional ambulation. Our recent work demonstrated individuals who received gait training, but primarily used a wheelchair one year after SCI received less transfer and wheeled mobility training and had lower measures of participation than non-ambulatory individuals who never received gait training. In the context of decreasing inpatient rehabilitation length of stays, it is crucial that time in therapy be used efficiently to maximize function at discharge and avoid those long-term consequences.  Lower limb movement (LLM) captured using activity monitors may provide a more sensitive measure of strength and sensation than traditional methods such as manual muscle and light touch sensation testing. This technique is novel in that LLM has not yet been reported in literature for individuals with SCI. Our preliminary analysis has shown promise for the association between LLM, strength, and ambulatory ability (as defined by measures of gait quality, efficiency, and endurance). Using machine learning techniques, we are able to determine which factors have the strongest association with ambulatory ability, among LLM, subject demographics, clinical characteristics, and other covariates.  Our long-term goal is to improve CPRs that predict ambulation after SCI, thus enabling appropriately targeted functional mobility training. As a first step towards this goal, we will build a foundational knowledge of LLM and its relationship as a potential biomarker for ambulatory ability cross-sectionally among individuals with chronic SCI and known, diverse functional abilities (Aim 1). We will also explore longitudinal LLM data and ambulatory ability for a population with acute SCI (Aim 2) to evaluate changes in LLM over time and create a preliminary prediction model.  Achieving the proposed aims will provide new insights into factors that predict mobility in individuals with SCI and provide understanding as to how these factors change acutely following injury. Further, we will gain insight to guide a future multisite longitudinal study that will assess a new, more effective CPR. This CPR will aid clinical decision-making for individuals with SCI by allowing for optimally targeted therapies to be employed throughout the rehabilitation continuum, thus improving long-term functional outcomes. Project Narrative Current rules are not sufficient in predicting ambulation among individuals with moderate strength and sensory deficits after a spinal cord injury, and this can lead to an inefficient use of therapy time. By measuring actual lower limb movement using activity monitors, we believe we can capture an unexplained variance missing from current prediction models that use traditional clinical measures to more accurately predict ambulatory ability. Accomplishing the goals outlined in this proposal will provide clinicians with a better understanding of ambulatory prognosis after spinal cord injury and will allow for optimal target therapies to be employed throughout the rehabilitation continuum to maximize functional outcomes and quality of life.",Monitoring Lower Limb Movement to Predict Ambulatory Ability after Spinal Cord Injury,10049966,F30HD096828,"['Accounting', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Caffeine', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Community Participation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'functional outcomes', 'gait rehabilitation', 'improved', 'independent ambulation', 'indexing', 'insight', 'limb movement', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'spasticity', 'targeted treatment']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F30,2021,39636
"Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments Project Summary This proposed project will develop and field-test a device that accurately monitors and controls the circadian stimulus (CS) for Alzheimer disease (AD) and Alzheimer-disease-related dementia (ADRD) patients in nursing homes. Human biology has evolved to have two distinct optical systems: the visual system, by which we see and process images, and the circadian system, which regulates our biological clock and associated biological systems. These two systems have significantly different spectral and temporal responses to optical input. Specifically, circadian stimulation peaks at 460 nm and responds after several minutes of optical activation, while the visual system peaks at 555 nm and responds nearly instantaneously to inputs. All lighting systems are designed and installed in buildings with consideration only given to the photopic (visual) system and all light meters used to characterize lighting buildings are calibrated to measure photopic light, not CS. While a broad and growing body of research has documented the impacts of the circadian system on human health, including regulating sleep and improving cognition in AD/ADRD patients, research on the CS experienced by AD/ADRD patients is extremely limited. Researchers at the Lighting Research Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed the Daysimeter, a calibrated light meter that measures circadian light and circadian stimulus. In Phase I of this project, researchers modified an existing workstation-based lighting control system they previously developed for the visual system to include Daysimeter technology, allowing this control system to record CS measurements. The accuracy of these CS measurements was confirmed in the laboratory and field-testing of 20 of devices is currently ongoing in AD/ADRD nursing homes. In this Phase II application, researchers propose adding control features to this device so that lighting can be controlled to optimize CS dosages in AD/ADRD patient environments. Machine learning-based lighting control algorithms will be driven by continuous light level and spectrum measurements as well as periodic (e.g., daily) patient health data. Data from these devices would be wirelessly transmitted to researchers via an Internet gateway and associated cloud-based data management systems. These data would be of immediate value for gaining a better understanding of AD/ADRD patients' CS exposure and could ultimately result in new lighting systems and/or building codes that consider both our visual and circadian systems. Following the development phase, 30 CS-enabled lighting control systems will be field tested over a 22-week test period. Researchers aim to commercialize this CS-enabled lighting control system shortly after the completion of this field test and the Phase II project specifically targeting AD/ADRD nursing home applications. Project Narrative A growing body of research has demonstrated how light impacts human circadian systems and how these impacts can affect sleep, alertness, cognition and agitation in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Alzheimer's-disease-related dementia (ADRD). Still, significant knowledge gaps exist in determining how much circadian stimulation is typically provided to AD/ADRD patients and there are no commercial products designed to control lighting in AD/ADRD environments in ways that promote circadian-related health. This project aims to fill in these gaps by developing and testing a device specifically designed to measure and control the circadian stimulation experienced by AD/ADRD patients in nursing homes.",Device to control circadian-effective light in Alzheimer's disease environments,10312690,R44AG060857,"['Affect', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Clocks', 'Building Codes', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Data', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Feeds', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Nursing Homes', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Phototherapy', 'Planet Earth', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Rotation', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Wakefulness', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'active control', 'alertness', 'appropriate dose', 'awake', 'base', 'biological systems', 'circadian', 'circadian pacemaker', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'design', 'dosage', 'effectiveness testing', 'experience', 'falls', 'field study', 'health data', 'improved', 'interest', 'meter', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prototype', 'residence', 'response', 'success', 'therapy design']",NIA,"ERIK PAGE AND ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2021,28487
"Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface Project Summary: The long-term goal of this research is to develop a new, non-invasive brain-computer interface (BCI) that will provide augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) capabilities to patients who have lost these capabilities due to severe motor impairments, such as completely locked-in syndrome (CLIS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and severe cerebral palsy (CP). The proposed research project will work towards a long-term goal by developing a BCI based on brain imaging signals from high-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT). Some existing BCIs record electroencephalography (EEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG) signals from patients and then decode these signals into instructions for operating some element of the outside world, such as a cursor on a screen, a prosthetic limb, or a virtual keyboard. This functionality can enable communication. However, BCI generally has had limited success and capabilities in CLIS patients with EEG or has relied on invasive technology such as ECoG or intracortical recordings, which require surgical placement of electrodes on or beneath the brain surface. Although functional MRI (fMRI) has recently achieved great success with decoding items viewed or heard by subjects (e.g., distinguishing from among >100 viewed images), fMRI requires bulky, expensive equipment that cannot be employed for routine BCI for patients with severe motor- related communication deficits. In contrast, optical imaging approaches, such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), employ portable, wearable hardware. These optical systems are non-invasive and use non-ionizing, near-infrared light to create movies of blood oxygenation and therefore provide physiological information comparable to the fMRI signal. NIRS has recently been applied as an alternative to EEG BCI for decoding simple yes/no responses in CLIS patients. However, NIRS systems suffer from much-lower spatial resolution than fMRI, which renders NIRS unlikely to match the decoding capabilities of fMRI. High-density diffuse optical tomography (HDDOT) combines the lightweight, low-cost equipment benefits of EEG and NIRS with higher spatial resolution closer to that of fMRI at the brain surface. Recent advances in HDDOT systems have enabled average spatial localization errors <5 mm and spatial resolution <17-20 mm (substantially better than NIRS). Studies have demonstrated detailed maps of both visual and language tasks. These properties make HDDOT an ideal candidate tool for decoding brain function. The fellowship training will provide a strong foundation in optical neuroimaging methods, machine learning, and brain-computer interface. These experiences will prepare the applicant exceptionally well for a career in biomedical engineering research and for developing technology that will improve these patients’ quality of life. Project Narrative: This project will develop decoding methods and evaluate their feasibility for using a high- performance optical brain scanner to identify and distinguish between imaging tasks in human subjects. The long-term goal of this research is to enable locked-in patients to communicate with others using augmented communication facilitated by a portable brain-scanning device, and a computer that decodes their brain signals.",Optical Tomography and Decoding for Communication via Brain-Computer Interface,10078847,F31NS110261,"['Adult', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Augmentative and Alternative Communication', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Clip', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Imagination', 'Instruction', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Light', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Literature', 'Locked-In Syndrome', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Muscle', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Psyche structure', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Semantics', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'career', 'cost', 'density', 'diffuse optical tomography', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'frontal lobe', 'human subject', 'imaging approach', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'light weight', 'mental imagery', 'motor impairment', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive system', 'optical imaging', 'portability', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,29520
"Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest Project Summary In situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest, it is critical to quickly detect the performance of adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) through clinically acceptable pulse rate and blood pressure (BP). However, the detection of adequate CPR can be difficult for someone not trained in first aid. Currently the standard for measuring BP noninvasively is using cuff-based oscillometeric approaches. Attempts at developing these into wearable devices for automated and continuous measurements have proven difficult and so researchers have looked at other methods. However, these methods have not met the criteria for flexibility, accuracy, and low power consumption. This project aims to develop a flexible patch for accurate detection of pulse rate and blood pressure superficially through the radial, brachial, carotid, and/or femoral arteries. Piezoelectric polymers, are inherently flexible and have been used in many applications for pressure sensing, offering great potential for use as a patch-like sensor for monitoring of cardiovascular function. However, in the standard form, the material is not sensitive enough to accurately detect blood pressure. In our lab we have developed a core-shell nanofiber structure of conductive and piezoelectric nanofibers, respectively. The core-shell nanostructure shows a 4.5 times improvement in pressure sensitivity when compared to standard piezoelectric nanofibers and a nearly 40 times improvement when compared to piezoelectric polymer thin films. This improvement in pressure sensitivity should allow for a wearable device composed of these materials to exceed the necessary 35 dB signal to noise ratio required for the accurate detection of pulse wave velocity, a cardiovascular parameter used to determine blood pressure. Coupled with inkjet printing patterning techniques of conductive polymers developed in our lab, we propose to fabricate a novel core-shell nanofiber piezoelectric array in a wearable patch form for cardiovascular monitoring. In order to test this piezoelectric array and develop data-driven algorithms for the detection of blood pressure, testing will occur on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system capable of replicating a human’s diastolic and systolic blood pressures, pulse rates, and arterial mechanical properties. The blood pressure attainable by the simulated system falls within the AAMI standard benchmark for accuracy and precision for noninvasive blood pressure monitoring of 5 ± 8 mmHg. We will train various regression models using the data generated from this system to relate the detected pulse wave velocities to blood pressure and we will compare the outcomes to commonly used correlation equations. We propose that the fabrication methods we will develop, when coupled together with data-driven algorithms, will allow for the development of a low- power, flexible patch, capable of detecting pulse rate and blood pressure, giving feedback on the adequacy of CPR. Project Narrative This project plans to develop a patch-like sensor for detecting cardiovascular signals including pulse rate and blood pressure for situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest. The proposed research couples a novel core-shell piezoelectric nanostructure with an inkjet printing method for fabricating flexible arrays, to create a new class of wearable patch-like sensors for cardiovascular monitoring. Testing these sensors on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system, will allow for the development of data-driven algorithms to improve the accuracy of these devices, leading to highly accurate, patch-like cardiovascular sensing.",Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest,10288237,R21EB032056,"['Algorithms', 'Arteries', 'Benchmarking', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'First Aid', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Heart Arrest', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ink', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Polymers', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Pulse Rates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structure', 'Sulfur', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'detection method', 'falls', 'femoral artery', 'first responder', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mechanical properties', 'nanofiber', 'novel', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'polyvinylidene fluoride', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'pulse pressure wave', 'radial artery', 'random forest', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,232061
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device,10266206,U18TR003812,"['Acute', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 monitoring', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Process', 'Production', 'RADx Radical', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'fight against', 'fighting', 'global health', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nasopharyngeal swab', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'point of care', 'portability', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'respiratory hypoxia', 'screening', 'severe COVID-19', 'two-dimensional']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U18,2021,999775
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,10166912,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2021,678001
"Augmented Reality Platform for Telehealth Rehabilitiation Efforts to keep the most vulnerable individuals with chronic medical conditions from being exposed to COVID- 19 have triggered an unprecedented decline in the number of visits to ambulatory practices. The repercussions have impacted not only those with the disease, but the many millions of older persons in need of healthcare who forego in-person visits in fear of infection or for socioeconomic reasons. While the precipitating need for alternative healthcare delivery methods has hastened the adoption of software solutions, such as Zoom, traditional videoconferencing services fail to compensate for the lack of direct physical evaluations with a patient that is needed for evaluating musculoskeletal (MSK) deficits, planning therapeutic interventions, and guiding exercise compliance—essential components of evidence-based practice among rehabilitation practitioners. To overcome these shortcomings, our team of computer vision and human movement engineers is partnering with orthopedic rehabilitation specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to develop a telehealth platform that fuses high resolution RGB and Depth (RGD-D) video data readily obtainable from a modern smartphone to facilitate quantitative, MSK assessment. The innovation builds upon our work in computing movement outcome measures from vision-based body tracking algorithms, and our skills in augmented reality (AR) software development to enhance a clinician’s assessment and exercise instruction capabilities. Our pilot data demonstrate that accurate quantitative rehabilitation outcomes are obtainable using RGB-D body tracking algorithms during a sub-set of knee activities. Phase I will advance these capabilities by deriving and validating the accuracy of 3D body tracking and rehabilitation outcome measures during a wider set of activities used clinically for assessing knee mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength, and function from depth enabled smartphone video recordings in control subjects (Aim 1). Aim 2 will develop a proof-of-concept AR telehealth platform with the help of the MGH team that delivers an enhanced telehealth experience through real-time synchronized audio-visual processing, real-time display of quantitative rehabilitation outcomes for the therapist to assess deficits or guide exercise compliance, and instructional animations for the patient to safely carry out the rehabilitation activities. The proof-of-concept prototype will undergo feasibility testing in Aim 3 among n=5 physical therapists and n=10 patients with knee OA during a simulated telehealth session to achieve high ratings for usability, accessibility, and effectiveness. The results will inform the user-requirements of a more complete Phase II telehealth platform designed in close collaboration with industry partners to provide secure cloud based communication for seamless interoperability between devices; additional examination tools (e.g. gait analysis); a broader range of baseline assessment and therapeutic exercise protocols for additional MSK conditions; and HIPAA-compliant deployment and electronic documentation management. The final prototype system will be evaluated during actual telehealth visits at multiple clinical sites to promote safe and effective clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical care has by necessity shifted towards telehealth delivery for people at risk due to age, who live in underserved communities or avoid in-person visits out of fear of viral transmission. Existing telehealth software platforms are generally supportive of videoconferencing but have yet to provide rehabilitation professionals with quantitative outcomes typically obtained from direct physical evaluations with a patient. To overcome this shortcoming, we are developing an augmented reality platform that fuses RGB and depth imaging from a patient’s smartphone to deliver quantitative outcomes of knee joint mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength and function during a telehealth visit to support the mandate for more effective remote delivery of evidence-based rehabilitation during the global pandemics and beyond.",Augmented Reality Platform for Telehealth Rehabilitiation,10256844,R43AG072991,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Augmented Reality', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quarantine', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic exercise', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videoconferencing', 'Virtual Tool', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animation', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cloud based', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'gait examination', 'health care delivery', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'joint mobilization', 'new technology', 'outpatient programs', 'pandemic disease', 'partial recovery', 'patient safety', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'remote delivery', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'software development', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'underserved community', 'usability', 'viral transmission', 'visual processing']",NIA,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2021,286972
"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs. The CRN community of practice will enable centralized knowledge sharing to support cross-specialty and technology learning and applications. Through this, we advance the CRNs using innovative, scalable, and dynamic approaches and help them become foundational components of NEST. Narrative Medical Device Epidemiology Network will advance the research and surveillance capabilities of coordinated registry networks through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and linkages of real-world data sources.

"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10187539,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detection platform', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2021,399000
"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,10088471,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,768996
"Cell Type Specific Genetic Manipulation to Dissect Cholinergic Interneuron Function and Plasticity in a Symptomatic Model of DYT1 Dystonia Project Summary/Abstract Cholinergic neurons (ChIs) are a central but poorly understood element of striatal circuitry. A considerable literature strongly implicates ChI dysfunction in the pathogenesis of abnormal movements, especially in dystonia and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson disease. A common theme of these studies is that maladaptive plastic changes cause aberrant ChI output and connectivity, promoting motor dysfunction. The central goal of this proposal is to advance understanding of the cellular and synaptic mechanisms through which ChIs cause motor dysfunction by employing novel selective genetic and chemical strategies in a recently validated model of DYT1 dystonia. Conditional Knock Out of torsinA from all striatal neurons (using Dlx5/6-Cre; “Dlx-CKO”) causes selective neurodegeneration of dorsolateral striatal ChI. ChI degeneration occurs roughly coincident with the juvenile onset of abnormal twisting movements in these mice, and selective ChI abnormalities are also present in postmortem tissue from DYT1 subjects. These movements are suppressed by the same anti-muscarinic compounds used to treat patients with DYT1 dystonia, establishing model therapeutic validity and suggesting shared pathophysiology with human dystonia. Surviving striatal ChIs are enlarged and hyperexcitable, and receive aberrant synaptic inputs. Selective ablation of these surviving ChI suppresses abnormal twisting, implicating these cells as key contributors to abnormal movements. Based on these data, we hypothesize that maladaptations in surviving ChIs drive motor dysfunction. Successful completion of the proposed studies will fundamentally advance understanding of maladaptive mechanisms whereby ChI function and connectivity drive abnormal movements, information highly significant for multiple striatal diseases. We will first address our hypothesis by testing the necessity of striatal ChI dysfunction in abnormal movement generation by selectively restoring torsinA to these cells (Aim 1), decisively moving beyond the current association between these factors. We will determine if cholinergic dysfunction arises primarily from intrinsic ChI abnormalities or defects in how they respond to afferents (Aim 2), and, informed by Aims 1 and 2, will pursue translational studies (Aim 3) testing whether directly modulating the activity of surviving ChIs can suppress dystonic-like movements. This proposal is therefore highly signifiant because it will define a circuit-based model of motor dysfunction that will inform the design of targeted therapeutics. Project Narrative DYT1 dystonia is an incurable brain disease characterized by involuntary twisting movements for which there are no reliably effective treatments. This proposal employs unique genetic strategies to target a specific class of neurons (striatal cholinergic interneurons) that appear essential to the abnormal movements. These advanced genetic studies will establish the role of cholinergic interneurons in dystonia and test a novel approach to prevent or suppress the disease symptoms.",Cell Type Specific Genetic Manipulation to Dissect Cholinergic Interneuron Function and Plasticity in a Symptomatic Model of DYT1 Dystonia,10210051,R01NS110853,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Autopsy', 'Autoreceptors', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug usage', 'Dyskinetic syndrome', 'Dystonia', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'L-DOPA induced dyskinesia', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'TorsinA', 'base', 'cell type', 'cholinergic', 'cholinergic neuron', 'conditional knockout', 'design', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'effective therapy', 'genetic approach', 'genetic manipulation', 'loss of function mutation', 'motor behavior', 'motor disorder', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'targeted treatment', 'tomography', 'tool', 'translational study']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,516285
"Resting State Connectivity in Primate Spinal Cord ABSTRACT / SUMMARY  This proposal aims to continue our research to identify and characterize resting state functional MRI signals within the grey matter of the spinal cord, and to validate the interpretation of resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) networks in the spine that appear to reflect specific, behaviorally-relevant functions. In the current funding period we have found resting state networks within the cord exhibit more complex connectivity than previously reported, both within and across segments, including significant correlations with the intermediate region and grey commissure that are relevant for autonomic functions and left-right coordination. Importantly, by implementing a dorsal column injury to the cervical spine in a non-human primate, we have confirmed that the strengths of connectivity within these networks are in general related to functional performance, and changes in the networks correspond to behavioral changes in, for example, skilled hand use. We next aim to fully characterize the sub-components of rsFC and relate them to more specific functions. We will acquire sub-millimeter, multi-parametric MR images at high field (9.4T) in squirrel monkeys and address three main aims. (1) We will identify and differentiate rsFC networks within spinal cord using selective lesions and pharmacological interventions to determine which components and network connectivities are affected by specific disruptions of normal sensory or motor pathways. We will isolate circuits affected by (a) reversible block of motor or sensory inputs with pharmacological agents; (b) permanently ablating the drive of motor neurons from primary motor cortex in ventral horn; and (c) disrupting sensory signals to dorsal horn neurons by sectioning dorsal spinal nerve roots. We will follow the evolution of each injury using CEST and DTI to measure the extent and severity of the injury, and DTI and qMT to validate injury severity and quantify changes in axonal integrity and myelination. (2) We will validate the rsFC measures from MRI by comparisons with electrophysiology, micro-stimulation and tract-tracing histology. We will (a) directly stimulate specific nodes while monitoring down-stream activity with electrophysiology and fMRI; (b) perform longitudinal fMRI and microarray recordings of electrical coherences in each monkey subjected to specific interventions (Aim 1); and (c) determine whether regions which appear to be functionally connected by fMRI also show strong anatomical connections by injecting tracers and performing histological assessments post mortem. (3) We will determine the functional and behavioral relevance of rsFC by disrupting each circuit, identifying corresponding changes in rsFC, and relating these changes to performance of skilled hand sensorimotor behavior. By the completion of the study, we will validate rsFC measurements as indicators of spinal cord functions, and establish the fine- grained intrinsic architecture of intra-spinal circuits. These studies will provide new information on the neural organization of the spinal cord, validate the interpretation of BOLD measurements of connectivity, and provide a roadmap for the use of fMRI for studying human spinal cord functions. Narrative The studies proposed will identify and differentiate neural networks within the grey matter of the spinal cord that subserve different functions and which may be detected using functional MRI. The patterns of connections between different sub-regions of the cord will be quantified before and after targeted interventions that are intended to disrupt specific functions. The interpretation of functional MRI measurements will be validated using electrophysiology and post-mortem histology.",Resting State Connectivity in Primate Spinal Cord,10209997,R01NS092961,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Autopsy', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Cervical spinal cord structure', 'Cervical spine', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grain', 'Gray Commissure', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Home environment', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor Pathways', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Posterior Horn Cells', 'Primates', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Saimiri', 'Seeds', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Cord Lesions', 'Spinal Dorsal Nerve', 'Spinal cord grey matter structure', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Spinal nerve root structure', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Vertebral column', 'base', 'deep learning', 'dorsal column', 'grasp', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'microstimulation', 'myelination', 'neural network', 'nonhuman primate', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'treatment effect']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,562560
"Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors In-home sensing technologies hold enormous potential for early detection of health changes that can dramatically affect the experiences of aging: enabling functional independence, improving self-management of chronic or acute conditions, and improving quality of life. Chronic diseases especially affect older adults. Problems in chronic disease management are often the cause of losing independence for aging Americans. In 2012, 1 in 2 American adults (117 million) had at least one chronic condition, and 26% of the population had multiple chronic conditions, accounting for 84% of US health care costs. Early illness recognition and early treatment is key to improving health status with rapid recovery after an exacerbation of a chronic illness or acute illness, and also key to reducing morbidity and mortality in older adults and controlling health care costs.  In previous work, the team developed a health alert system that captures and analyzes data from sensors embedded in the home. Sensor data are captured passively and continuously in the home. In a pilot NIH R21 study, significant differences in health outcomes were shown with health alerts from motion and bed sensor data, based on bed restlessness and low, normal, and high pulse and respiration rates. The system actually detected changes in chronic diseases or acute illnesses on average 10 days to 2 weeks before usual assessment methods or self-reports of illness. For this project, the team will expand from the clinician-focused system to a consumer-focused system by incorporating more finely grained sensing (gait and quantitative pulse and respiration), with new improved algorithms that integrate individual health status and medication use, and track trajectories of health changes, for more sensitive, and more personalized health alerts with fewer false alarms. A recently developed bed sensor will be incorporated to passively capture quantitative pulse, respiration, and restlessness while the subject is resting. Gait parameters (e.g., in-home walking speed, stride time and stride length) will also be captured using depth images that show shadowy silhouettes. In addition, the team will solicit the consumer perspective on customized health alerts and a user interface for displaying sensor and alert information. The views of seniors and their family members will be used to inform the development of the new customized alert algorithms and drive the development of a consumer-focused interface that will provide empowering tools for self-management of chronic illnesses. In addition, the use of commercially available wrist-worn sensors will be explored for the purpose of recognizing health changes. The study will include a retrospective analysis of sensor data collected in 13 senior housing sites in Missouri. New participants will be recruited in 5 senior housing sites in Columbia, MO to investigate the consumer perspective. The important process of engaging consumers in this work is the next step in translating these systems into clinical practice for self-managing chronic health conditions, supporting seniors living independently. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will build on our current work using intelligent, in-home sensor systems with automated health alerts to investigate new health alert algorithms that are more sensitive and more customized to the individual. These will be tested with data from 13 senior housing sites in Missouri using clinician feedback and actual health trajectories for evaluation. We will also recruit subjects in independent living housing to solicit the views of consumers on wearable sensors, health alerts, and user interfaces that allow seniors and their family members to view the health alert information in a way that empowers them to better self-manage their own health.",Customized Health Alerts and Consumer-Centered Interfaces Using In-Home and Wearable Sensors,10075985,R01NR016423,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Beds', 'Caregivers', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Feedback', 'Gait', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Missouri', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Self Management', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'active control', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'design', 'empowered', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'fitness', 'functional independence', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'improved', 'information display', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'preference', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'tool', 'walking speed', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,100000
"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells. Our device will implement new algorithms that measure and control that rhythmic firing, restoring patterns of healthy communication.",Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks,10227769,R01MH123634,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Testing', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electronics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufactured form', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analog', 'animal safety', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'commercialization', 'conditioning', 'design', 'digital', 'emotional functioning', 'first-in-human', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'nanofabrication', 'neural circuit', 'neurotechnology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychiatric symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'safety testing', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trigonometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,871272
"BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline ABSTRACT Clinical Need: As the US population ages, managing pathologies that largely affect older adults, including sarcopenia (e.g., loss of muscle mass and strength), represents a significant and growing clinical challenge. In addition to increased rates of sarcopenia with age, it is well-accepted that its incidence and impact increases after acute illness, placing persons at additional risk for functional decline, institutionalization, or death. Resistance-based exercises promote muscle regeneration and strength, and are an advised therapy for such patients. Yet, exercises are normally conducted either under direct clinical oversight, or unsupervised by patients at home, where compliance rates are low. Limitations: Current regimens rely on self-report diaries or verbal reports that may be inaccurate and subject to recall bias. Remote monitoring systems that measure, track, analyze, and provide patient-oriented feedback may overcome these limitations and enhance exercise regimen engagement. An at-home device that monitors and transmits exercise data to the user and clinician represents a potential solution to this clinical challenge. Our Product – BandPass is a remote-sensing, bluetooth-enabled resistance exercise band that will accurately gauge force through a potentiometric sensor rigidly fixed to elastic-tubing purposely designed for resistance training. The device is similar to currently available exercise bands familiar to clinicians and patients, with the significant novel addition of integrated force monitoring and internet-connectivity. A mobile app and cloud-based platform will provide computational resources for data visualization, storage and analysis, which will enable direct patient feedback, clinical monitoring of patient compliance and progress, and serve as a platform for more advanced operations such as automatic exercise-type classification to ease user burden (e.g., minimizing required interactions between the user and mobile device). We hypothesize that BandPass will provide clinically relevant data on compliance and use of exercise training with feedback that will be personalized. Specific Objectives: We specifically propose to design custom electronics and housing for BandPass and to perform in-lab validation studies of device accuracy, precision, and long-term stability. BandPass will be interfaced to a mobile app and cloud-based platform we will implement for data transmission, storage, and analysis. Finally, we will deploy BandPass in a human subjects pilot study to demonstrate usability and system stability in an at-home setting. Future Directions: SynchroHealth is a small company developing an mHealth platform that uses internet-connected devices to help improve quality of life in older adults. This device will complement our existing efforts. By the end of this Phase 1 effort, we will have demonstrated that BandPass is functional in a human population and we will have provided evidence that this approach can be deployed effectively in an at-home setting. This will position us for Phase 2 funding focused on optimizing our device for manufacturing, developing and optimizing a full suite of cloud-based analysis tools and mobile applications, conducting clinical trials aimed at demonstrating efficacy, and preparing to register this as a 510(k)-exempt device for marketing purposes and establishing Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP). PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical care for older adults that suffer from sarcopenia (e.g. loss of muscle mass and strength) typically involves the use of physical therapy regimens that rely on patients performing a series of at-home resistance-based exercises in order to retain or build muscle strength and prevent further atrophy. Resistance exercises using elastic bands has been a primary tool for clinicians, however remotely monitoring a patient’s compliance, confirming the quality of exercises performed, and tracking performance has been a significant challenge, with no tools currently available to provide this level of insight. Here, we propose to develop BandPass, an internet-enable resistance exercise band instrumented to automatically sense forces generated during exercise which will enable remote monitoring, compliance checking, and exercise classification and help to overcome the current shortcomings in clinical management of these patients.",BandPass: A Remote Monitoring System for Sarcopenia and Functional Decline,10152884,R41AG071290,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Android', 'Atrophic', 'Bluetooth', 'Boston', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elderly', 'Electronics', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Institutionalization', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Orthopedics', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age-related muscle loss', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'compliance behavior', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data visualization', 'design', 'diaries', 'exercise regimen', 'exercise training', 'functional decline', 'handheld mobile device', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'meetings', 'mobile application', 'monitoring device', 'muscle form', 'muscle regeneration', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'operation', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'remote monitoring', 'remote sensing', 'resistance exercise', 'sarcopenia', 'sensor', 'strength training', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NIA,SYNCHROHEALTH LLC,R41,2021,224700
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array",10266403,U18TR003775,"['Address', 'Age', 'Astronomy', 'Benchmarking', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 testing', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Housekeeping', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Lawyers', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Occupations', 'Odors', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Production', 'RADx', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Workplace', 'animal care', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'community setting', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high standard', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanosensors', 'next generation', 'novel virus', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health emergency', 'racial diversity', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sensor', 'sex', 'software development', 'software systems', 'vapor', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U18,2021,999830
"Interpretable machine learning for understanding the neural control of movement Modern machine learning can fit complex models that make accurate predictions. However, understanding the brain with standard machine learning is a great challenge. A critical impediment is that it is often difficult to understand the inner workings of these models. There is thus a great need for more interpretable machine learning methods for neuroscience, in which the inner workings of the model relate to neural structure or function. The proposed research will develop interpretable machine learning methods for studying the neural control of movement. Through close collaboration with the experimental lab of Dr. Churchland, these methods will be applied to answer three central questions in motor control. In the first two aims, the research investigates how flexibly spinal motor neurons can be controlled, and how activity in motor cortex controls muscle activity across a wide range of movements. Beyond increasing scientific knowledge, answering these two questions could enhance brain computer interfaces for restoring control to those with motor impairments. In the third aim, the research investigates how multiple neural populations interact with each other to plan and generate movement. This question is relevant to many neurological disorders, in which communication between brain areas is disrupted. During the K99 phase of this award, occurring within Columbia’s vibrant neuroscience community, the applicant will receive additional training in computational techniques from Drs. Paninski and Cunningham, and additional experimental training from Dr. Churchland. This training will provide the necessary experience for the applicant to be successful in this work and to successfully start an independent lab at the interface of machine learning and the neural control of movement. While the development of many new neural recording technologies has led to much excitement, it has created a huge gap between our ability to collect data and our ability to deeply understand it. More interpretable machine learning tools are necessary for understanding neural function in health and neurological disease, to one day develop curative interventions. The goal of this research is to develop interpretable machine learning models and apply them to understand how brain areas interact with each other and how they control muscle activity during a wide range of movements.",Interpretable machine learning for understanding the neural control of movement,10106091,K99NS119787,"['Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Intramuscular', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Side', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Cord', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'cortex mapping', 'curative treatments', 'data structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'tool']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,K99,2021,125442
"An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment Abstract The overall goal of this proposal is to combine expertise and approaches from biomedical engineering and critical care medicine to design a universal system to acquire, record and transmit physiological signals from bedside monitored patients. Patient monitors generate over a million datapoints of information per hour, however, only a tiny fraction of those data are transmitted or recorded. In order to improve data exchange in healthcare, the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was published in 2014. However, it has yet to make a significant impact on Medical Device Integration (MDI), which is the process of automating the flow of clinical data from bedside medical devices, such as patient monitors, to external systems such as Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Also, MDI is a complex task because data from these devices are high-frequency and high- volume and because most devices use proprietary protocols and outdated interfaces such as serial cables. Hospitals and researchers have therefore been left with few options except to use expensive and vendor-specific MDI solutions to access these data or to use manual data entry into the patient EMR, which leads to data entry errors, late entry of data, and lost time for clinical care. Manual data entry only captures a tiny fraction of the available data, and with increased research interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, there is a growing need for a standardized way to access the vast amounts of data from bedside devices. This project will develop a vendor-neutral software-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) that acquires and records data from bedside devices across a hospital network and makes live data available to 3rd party systems using a FHIR application programming interface (API). The proposed proof-of-concept will consist of three elements: [i] a transmitter which encrypts and transmits patient signals across the network, [ii] an aggregator which receives, translates and records the signals to a central location, and [iii] a FHIR Server with API for allowing external systems to access live data as FHIR resources. This proposal seeks to create a novel design that will overcome a critical barrier in healthcare, medicine and research. The proposed MDDS will be valuable to hospitals, clinicians, researchers and app developers because it makes data accessible which were previously only available to clinicians at the bedside in real-time. Narrative MediCollector’s proposed vendor-neutral medical device data system (MDDS) will be a valuable research tool to access, acquire and record high-frequency bedside patient monitor data for facilitating clinical research in hospitals. In addition, it will make live patient monitor data accessible to external systems through an HL7 FHIR application programming interface (API), thereby improving interoperability in hospitals and opening the doors to the integration of live data into external systems, such as smartphone apps and artificial intelligence algorithms, which can improve clinical workflow and healthcare in general.",An Interoperable HL7 FHIR-based Medical Device Data System (MDDS) For Accessing And Integrating Live Point-Of-Care Data From High-Acuity Bedside Patient Monitoring Equipment,10353084,R43EB030890,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Elements', 'Equipment', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Information Systems', 'Left', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Vendor', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical care', 'data access', 'data exchange', 'design', 'encryption', 'improved', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'point of care', 'smartphone Application', 'tool']",NIBIB,"MEDICOLLECTOR, LLC",R43,2021,40963

"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,10266337,U18TR003795,"['2019-nCoV', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 test', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhalation', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Flushing', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heating', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Materials Testing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Spectrometry', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'clinical care', 'detector', 'deviant', 'differential expression', 'disease transmission', 'graphical user interface', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'ion mobility', 'large scale production', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pandemic disease', 'portability', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U18,2021,975463
"Spinal Neurons that shape the way we move: diversity supplement for Ms. Gonzalez Project Summary/Abstract A central challenge in neuroscience biomedical research is to define the neural circuits that underlie behavior. Investigations of spinal cord circuits are ideally suited to answer these questions: the direct link between sensory input and motor output affords an exquisite experimental tractability that has been leveraged since Sherrington’s pioneering work on the proprioceptive reflex pathway1. Indeed, great progress has been made since then in understanding how proprioceptors (i.e., muscle sensory neurons) shape motor activity. Touch receptors in skin (i.e., cutaneous sensory neurons) encoding sensory modalities like vibration, indentation, and slip, are also critical for adapting the way we walk in response to changes in our environment. However, spinal cord integration of touch pathways that sculpt motor activity remains profoundly poorly understood. To address key conceptual and technical challenges in this field, we have built an extensive mouse genetic toolbox to visualize, quantify and manipulate touch-specific spinal cord circuits. In addition, we merge these powerful genetic tools with motor assays involving high-speed cameras, computer vision, and machine learning to quantify somatosensory behavior with unprecedented sensitivity. Combining these technologies, we identified a novel touch-specific premotor network important for sensorimotor function. Our overall hypothesis is that this network represents a critical node for integrating touch information to influence specific patterns of muscle groups that facilitate both corrective movements during locomotion and motor ‘switching’ during naturalistic behaviors. We interrogate this novel network to address fundamental questions whose answers will enable a deeper understanding of how touch pathways converge in the spinal cord to shape movement. In Aims 1 and 2 we combine genetic approaches, high-resolution synaptic analysis, slice electrophysiology and in-vivo muscle recordings to test the hypothesis that this network integrates multimodal sensory information to coordinate specific muscles in response to cutaneous input. Aim 3 combines joint and muscle activity recordings to test the hypothesis that this network shapes cutaneous responses to facilitate corrective movements during locomotion. We extend these behavioral studies by implementing computer vision and machine learning to parse out naturalistic behaviors into sub- second movements to test the hypothesis that touch-specific premotor networks sculpt how micro-movements are pieced together into complex motor behaviors . By understanding the final path for movement organization (i.e., the spinal cord) our research will lead to new therapies aimed at improving the quality of life of people suffering from a variety of neurological disorders. Thus, this research lays the critical foundation for novel ways to modulate spinal circuits for improving motor function.

"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user’s location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user’s location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user’s trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings. The proposed research would result in a new smartphone-based wayfinding app that could greatly increase travel independence for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,10129965,R01EY029033,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cost Measures', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elevator', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Indoor environment', 'Infrastructure', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Needs Assessment', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Research', 'Schools', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'interest', 'lens', 'meetings', 'open source', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'way finding', 'wireless fidelity']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,403882
"Machine-learning based control of functional electrical stimulation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Functional electrical stimulation involves artificial activation of paralyzed muscles with implanted electrodes and has been used successfully to improve the ability of tetraplegics to perform movements important for daily activities. The range of motor behaviors that can be generated by functional electrical stimulation, however, is limited to a relatively small set of preprogrammed movements such as hand grasp and release. A broader range of movements has not been implemented because of the substantial challenge associated with identifying the patterns of muscle stimulation needed to elicit specified movements. To address this limitation, we have developed machine-learning based algorithms that can predict patterns of muscle activity associated with a wide range of complex limb movements. In addition, we have devised a method whereby predicted patterns of muscle activity can then be transformed into stimulus pulse patterns needed to evoke movements in paralyzed limbs. Our goal for this project is to determine whether these approaches, when applied to temporarily paralyzed non-human primates, can be used to produce: 1) a wide range of movements of the hand throughout peri-personal reach space, and 2) configuration of the hand and fingers into a variety of shapes needed to interact with diverse objects in the environment. If successful, this approach would greatly expand the repertoire of motor behaviors available to individuals paralyzed because of spinal cord injury or stroke. Furthermore, this system ultimately might serve as the requisite interface between brain-derived trajectory information and functional electrical stimulation systems needed to realize a self-contained and self- controlled upper limb neuroprosthetic. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop methods to artificially activate and control paralyzed muscles with electrodes implanted in muscles.

"Optimizing BCI-FIT: Brain Computer Interface - Functional Implementation Toolkit SUMMARY  Many of the estimated four million adults in the U.S. with severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) resulting from neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative diseases cannot rely on current assistive technologies (AT) for communication. During a single day, or as their disease progresses, they may transition from one access technology to another due to fatigue, medications, changing physical status, or progressive motor dysfunction. There are currently no clinical or AT solutions that adapt to the multiple, dynamic access needs of these individuals, leaving many people poorly served. This competitive renewal, called BCI-FIT (Brain Computer Interface-Functional Implementation Toolkit) adds to our innovative multidisciplinary translational research conducted over the past 11 years for the advancement of science related to non-invasive BCIs for communication for these clinical populations. BCI-FIT relies on active inference and transfer learning to customize a completely adaptive intent estimation classifier to each user's multiple modality signals in real-time. The BCI-FIT acronym has many implications: our BCI fits to each user's brain signals; to the environment, offering relevant personal language; to the user's internal states, adjusting signals based on drowsiness, medications, physical and cognitive abilities; and to users' learning patterns from BCI introduction to expert use.  Three specific aims are proposed: (1) Develop and evaluate methods for optimizing system and user performance with on-line, robust adaptation of multi-modal signal models. (2) Develop and evaluate methods for efficient user intent inference through active querying. (3) Integrate language interaction and letter/word supplementation as input modalities in real-time BCI use. Four single case experimental research designs will evaluate both user performance and technology performance for functional communication with 35 participants with SSPI in the community, and 30 healthy controls for preliminary testing. The same dependent variables will be tested in all experiments: typing accuracy (correct character selections divided by total character selections), information transfer rate (ITR), typing speed (correct characters/minute), and user experience (UX) questionnaire responses about comfort, workload, and satisfaction. Our goal is to establish individualized recommendations for each user based on a combination of clinical and machine expertise. The clinical expertise plus user feedback added to active sensor fusion and reinforcement learning for intent inference will produce optimized multi-modal BCIs for each end-user that can adjust to short- and long-term fluctuating function. Our research is conducted by four sub-teams who have collaborated successfully to implement translational science: Electrical/computer engineering; Neurophysiology and systems science; Natural language processing; and Clinical rehabilitation. The project is grounded in solid machine learning approaches with models of participatory action research and AAC participation. This project will improve technologies and BCI technical capabilities, demonstrate BCI implementation paradigms and clinical guidelines for people with severe disabilities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The populations of US citizens with severe speech and physical impairments secondary to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases are increasing as medical technologies advance and successfully support life. These individuals with limited to no movement could potentially contribute to their medical decision making, informed consent, and daily caregiving if they had faster, more reliable means that adapt to their best access methods in communication technologies, as proposed in BCI-FIT.

"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Project Summary/Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project proposes the deployment of an AI-powered image-processing tool, named PostureCheck™, to automatically detect when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-extremity (UE) rehabilitation exercises. The system is based on a standard video camera and the artificial intelligence (AI) software developed under the NIH Phase-I project. PostureCheck™ will be fully integrated with Barrett Technology's existing Burt® UE rehabilitation robot, ensuring that patients are provided appropriate and timely feedback to encourage the correct performance of therapeutic exercises without requiring constant therapist supervision.  Burt® is an FDA-listed UE rehabilitation robot that supports the weight of a patient's arm and hand while the patient moves his/her arm to interact with on-screen games. Burt® offers guided assistance, visual and haptic feedback, and activities and assessments to both help train the patient and measure progress. Clinical studies have shown that Burt® can be used to improve patients' performance in one-on-one sessions with a therapist. However, the system lacks the capability for a single therapist to monitor and work with several patients and Burt® systems at one time.  The proposed SBIR Phase-II activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, the annotated dataset generated in Phase-I will be used to develop three separate AI modules. These modules will be integrated into a framework that allows therapists to monitor the outcome of the modules, and, through feedback, enable the system to auto- adapt to improve performance continuously. In Aim 2, stakeholder feedback will be gathered and integrated to design multiple user interfaces for the PostureCheck™ tool. Specific interfaces will be created for use by therapists during and after RT sessions. PostureCheck™ will be integrated with the Burt® device to empower therapists to provide effective feedback to patients and deter the use of compensatory movements. Finally, in Aim 3, forty-two stroke survivors will be recruited in an interventional study deploying the PostureCheck™ and Burt® systems. Subjects will undergo eighteen RT sessions in either an individual or group therapy format. Motor performance between groups will be compared to gather information about the suitability of the combined systems for multi-patient RT therapy in future rehabilitation centers.  The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a practical Burt®-plus-PostureCheck™ system to empower therapists to supervise multiple patients simultaneously through a gamut of useful functionalities.

Project Narrative  Each year, more than 650,000 Americans survive a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body in most cases. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and ultimately improved function.

"Sensory mechanisms of manual dexterity and their application to neuroprosthetics PROJECT SUMMARY Manual behavior requires sensory signals from the hand, both tactile and proprioceptive, as evidenced by the severe deficits that result from somatosensory deafferentation. Three aspects of the sensory component of hand sensory function are poorly understood. First, the neural basis of touch has been studied almost exclusively with stimuli delivered passively to the skin, precluding any understanding of how tactile signals are modulated by and interact with motor commands. Second, proprioceptive signals carry information not only about the time-varying conformation of the hand, but also about manually applied forces, but proprioceptive representations of force are poorly understood. Third, stereognosis – the sense of the three-dimensional shape of objects acquired from sensory signals arising from the hand – implies the integration of tactile and proprioceptive signals, a process about which little is known. The study of active touch, hand proprioception, and stereognosis has been hindered by technical obstacles. Indeed, characterizing self-generated contact with objects has been difficult or impossible, as has tracking hand movements with sufficient precision. To overcome these obstacles, my team has developed an apparatus that allows us to measure contact events – with a sensor sheet covering the object’s surface – and track time-varying hand postures – using deep learning-based computer vision – with unprecedented precision as animals interact with objects. We then characterize the responses at every stage along the somatosensory neuraxis, from peripheral nerve through cortex. This novel experimental set up will allow us to study the neural basis of somatosensation – particularly as it relates to manual dexterity – under ecologically valid conditions. In a related line of inquiry, we leverage what we learn about sensory processing to restore the sense of touch to bionic hands. In brief, we develop algorithms to convert the output of sensors on the bionic hand into patterns of electrical stimulation of the peripheral nerve (for amputees) or of somatosensory cortex (for people with tetraplegia) to evoke meaningful tactile percepts. I am one of the principal architects of the biomimetic approach to artificial touch, which posits that encoding algorithms that mimic natural neural signals will give rise to more intuitive tactile percepts, thereby endowing bionic hands with greater dexterity. Our work on artificial touch comprises three components: evaluation of the perceptual correlates of electrical stimulation, development of sensory encoding algorithms, and assessment of the benefits of artificial touch to manual behavior. The interplay of the basic scientific results and neural engineering efforts will result in more naturalistic artificial touch for brain- controlled bionic hands. PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to understand the neural basis of somatosensation – touch and proprioception – during manual interactions with objects. To this end, we measure time-varying limb postures, forces exerted on sensorized objects, and neuronal responses across the entire somatosensory neuraxis, as monkeys grasp objects whose size, shape, and location is under experimenter control. We then leverage what we have learned about somatosensory coding under active conditions to develop ever more intuitive ways to convey sensory feedback to bionic hands via electrical interfaces with somatosensory cortex.",Sensory mechanisms of manual dexterity and their application to neuroprosthetics,10240106,R35NS122333,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Amputees', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Biomimetics', 'Bionics', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Deafferentation procedure', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Hand', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Limb structure', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Nerve Stimulation', 'Peripheral Nerves', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Proprioception', 'Quadriplegia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Somatosensory Cortex', 'Stereognosis', 'Stimulus', 'Surface', 'Tactile', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Work', 'deep learning', 'dexterity', 'grasp', 'neuroprosthesis', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'object shape', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensory feedback', 'sensory mechanism', 'somatosensory']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R35,2021,1094647
"Population Invariant Neural Decoding Neural interfaces hold great potential to restore movement and communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. These systems rely on neural decoding algorithms to translate recorded neural activity into, for example, movements of a prosthetic limb or intended speech sounds. However, many technical challenges limit the predictive accuracy of these decoding models, preventing widespread deployment of restorative neuroprosthetic devices. A key challenge is the limited data available to train decoding models. In existing approaches, models must be trained separately for each individual subject, usually during simple behavioral tasks, and consequently fail to generalize well to new subjects or complex naturalistic behavioral settings. This proposal leverages recent advances in machine learning that directly address these limitations by developing a new decoding model framework that is capable of combining neural data across many subjects and tasks, as well as incorporating large-scale simulated data to improve prediction accuracy. In this framework, a single global model learns an internal representation of the neural system that is invariant to variations in behavioral task and stimulus set, anatomical variations, and functional variations in neural tuning of the underlying neuronal population (i.e., population-invariant neural decoding). This global model can therefore be applied and calibrated to new subjects and behavioral tasks where little or no additional training data is available. Using an existing intracranial neural data set collected from a large number of different subjects and stimulus sets, the project will establish this new modeling approach based on deep learning architectures that are explicitly designed to incorporate data pooled across subjects and tasks. We propose to show, through validation on measured intracranial neural data, that a global neuronal population-invariant decoding model substantially improves model prediction accuracy and generalization relative to existing state-of-the-art neural decoding models across many subjects. Development and validation of this approach will open new avenues for researchers to combine disparate data sets, for example, enabling community development, improvement, and sharing of “open source” models that can be shared among research groups and effectively applied across research studies. Thus, the proposal seeks to address key limitations in present neural decoding model approaches which must ultimately convert measured neural activity into useful behavioral or communication parameters across a wide range of subjects and complex behaviors in order for translational effects to be realized in important clinical applications of neural interfaces. Neural interfaces rely on predictive models to restore lost motor or communication function in millions of patients with paralysis, neuromuscular disorders, traumatic brain injury, stroke, or communication disorders. This project leverages novel machine learning models that allow neural data to be pooled across large-scale multi-subject data sets, permitting an order of magnitude increase in model complexity and prediction accuracy that is immediately generalizable across large patient populations with disordered speech or motor function. The outcome of this project is a new modeling framework where a single, highly performant global model can be easily calibrated to individual patient cases with limited data while maintaining high prediction accuracy.",Population Invariant Neural Decoding,10074557,R21DC018374,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Auditory', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Community Developments', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Experimental Designs', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Sensory', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Sound', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'TensorFlow', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'neuroprosthesis', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'premonitory sensory phenomena', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R21,2021,196250
"Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces Project Abstract. Candidate and career goals: I am an engineer by training, with a strong background in neural engineering and the development of motor brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). My career goal is to establish an independent nonhuman primate (NHP) laboratory with two primary aims. First, I will advance our fundamental understanding of the motor system via the combination of electrophysiology with novel statistical and computational methods. Second, I will leverage this knowledge to develop frameworks for superior BMI systems.  Throughout my academic and research career I have developed expertise in engineering, computation, and neuroscience with the goal of pursuing these aims. Advances in machine learning, large-scale neural recordings, and deep learning in neural networks are happening quickly (in part via the BRAIN Initiative), and are very promising for the field. Yet very few researchers have the correct combination of skills to make use of them in my areas of interest. In completing the proposed training, I will be uniquely positioned to perform the innovative work necessary to advance our understanding of the planning and execution of cortically controlled movements. I will train the next generation of scientists and engineers in the experimental and computational methods necessary to understand fundamental principles of cortical computations.  Research plan: In this project, I will employ multiple computational approaches to understand the structure of population activity in motor cortex (M1) across multiple kinds of behaviors. I will then use that knowledge to create high performance BMI decoders that will be applicable to a wide range of movements.  Recent empirical observations are changing our view of the structure of M1 activity. During one particular task (e.g., reaching), neural activity may seem to exist within a small space that it explores completely. Yet as more tasks are observed, it becomes clear that activity comprises a highly structured geometry within a much larger space. This means that activity patters for different movements do not come ‘near’ one another or overlap. While counterintuitive, this geometry yields new opportunities. By exploiting the separation of activity patterns, movements can be readily distinguished, even when unfolding simultaneously. I will further explore this geometry across multiple behaviors, both in primates and neural network models, to develop new BMI methods. The specific aims of the plan are to (1) create a high-performance decoder for a novel wheelchair-relevant navigation task, (2) build network models to understand M1 activity structure and identify decoding principles that will generalize across tasks (reaching, navigation), and (3) implement a multitask BMI using a unified decoder that allows animals to both navigate and interact with objects. Career development plan: I will be trained by Dr. Mark Churchland and Dr. Larry Abbott at Columbia University. Project Narrative Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret brain activity to control external devices (computers, prosthetic limbs), and can restore voluntary movement to individuals with limb loss or paralysis. BMIs for reaching and grasping have been demonstrated in human clinical trials, and must now be extended to perform a variety of movements. The proposed work will use advanced computational methods to create an intuitively controllable and high performance BMI system applicable to many natural movements, including locomotion. This work will both develop neurotechnology, and add to our scientific understanding of the computational principles that underlie activity in motor cortex.",Characterizing the structure of motor cortex activity across multiple behaviors for improved brain-machine interfaces,10126071,K99NS115919,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Animals', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Devices', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Paralysed', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'career', 'career development', 'combat', 'computational neuroscience', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'limb loss', 'meetings', 'mind control', 'multitask', 'network models', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotechnology', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'theories', 'virtual', 'virtual reality environment', 'virtual world']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K99,2021,136242
"Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System Project Summary/Abstract  Accurate assessment of daily functions for individuals at risk for and with AD/ADRD, is fundamental to detection, diagnosis, and characterization of its progression and prescribed treatments. Current assessment techniques typically rely on non- continuous, discreet observations provided from a third party and covering single or limited performance domains. With significantly larger portions of American’s choosing to age in place, any assessment technology must be able to be in-situ (low-cost, ubiquitous) and operate without user interface (autonomous) to provide objective, cross-domain, and continuous daily function measurements and reporting.  The primary objective of this fast track SBIR project is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of using the Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system to continuously and accurately assess daily functions, ADLs, and IADLs, for persons experiencing cognitive decline in a home or assisted care settings. This includes direct comparison with an accepted assessment technique, ADCS-ADL/23. Machine learning and artificial intelligent techniques will be employed to identify novel subfactors for improved sensitivities from available sensor data combinations. Secondary objectives include establishing a significant data set of detailed daily actions (<10 sec resolution) for 100+ individuals with AD/ADRD. Long-term goals support future intervention studies through improved assessment tools with enhanced sensitivity to early and mid-stage decline.  The Birkeland Current Sovrin IoT system makes use of patented proximity-based energy monitoring and control sensors, data analytics and change detection algorithms to continuously monitor activities of individuals in a home or assisted care environment. Intelligent power-strips and battery-based sensors located throughout the home or facility, monitor real time absolute location of individuals, caregivers, and devices they interact with. Correlation of high-fidelity data allows accurate determination of activities, attribution to a specific individual, mobility measurement, and behavior assessment across traditional and novel ADL/IADL categories. Birkeland Current is teamed with Texas A&M Center for Population Health and Aging, Georgia, Tech Institute for People and Technology, Baylor Scott and White Division of Gerontology, and multiple home-care and assisted-care facilities, in the development of the study approach, implementation plan, analytics tools, and applications to aging populations and future intervention studies. Project Narrative  The proposed research would utilize novel, ubiquitous Internet-of-Things sensors and automated analytics to demonstrate enhanced sensitivity and future utility of continuous in-situ IADL/ADL data for dementia research and its effectiveness in characterizing interventions for Alzheimer’s and related dementias of aging populations in support of NIA stated priorities.",Improved AD/ADRD Assessment Sensitivities Using a Novel In-Situ Sensor System,10144919,R44AG065118,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Centers for Population Health', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Dementia', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Health care facility', 'Home environment', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intelligence', 'Internet of Things', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Legal patent', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use Effectiveness', 'aging in place', 'aging population', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'database structure', 'design', 'detection platform', 'experience', 'home test', 'improved', 'insight', 'instrumental activity of daily living', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient home care', 'personalized care', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIA,BIRKELAND CURRENT LLC,R44,2021,1807912
"Portable Hearing Laboratory  - CRP In the parent Phase II project (R44DC016247; PI: C. Pavlovic) we successfully developed a portable platform for developing and testing new hearing aid technology. This Portable Hearing Laboratory, or PHL, has now been acquired and is being used by a number of leading university laboratories and other research centers and their feedback has been extremely positive. The device features a central unit (BatAndCat Box) which provides an appropriate and complete hearing aid ambient for developing new algorithms. A number of realistic interfaces has also been provided. This includes an extremely high quality BTE system we designed; an ITE system adapted by us, as well as an appropriate interface circuitry for typical wearables (e.g; headsets via the line input). Finally, a smart phone app features interfaces both for the researcher and the subject. The system runs the Master Hearing aid sweet developed concurrently in R01DC015429 (PIs Hohmann and Pavlovic). In this CRP renewal we will achieve the following goals: 1. Implement various Design for Excellence Measures (DFX) and super modern manufacturing  technology to obtain the highest product quality at the lowest product cost. This would make  the product affordable for large clinical studies and, potentially, for some consumer sales. 2. In response to the recent availability of, and the recent research demand for, a far greater  processing power to enable the development of algorithms which rely on machine learning,  we plan to increase the processing power of the device by at least 10 times, and likely 20  times, by changing the processor core to a multicore system. 3. Introduce modern low-latency BLE technology to enable efﬁcient noise reduction by utilizing  remote microphones and machine learning. 4. The other complementary requirement to extract speech from noise is being able to inform  the system whom the listener is actually listening to. This will be achieved by providing on  the PHL the interface means for external multi-sensor arrays such as EEG, OEG, etc. 5. Execute electrical and mechanical design changes dramatically reducing the size and  weight of the device. This would not only be a much more acceptable device for long clinical  trials, but would also open up a direct-to-consumer, secondary market for the device. 6. It is our strong determination to provide continuous support to the Beta sites for extensive  further testing of the device in a variety of settings. We consider this the best means to  reach the perfection. Portable Hearing Laboratory (PHL), developed in R44DC016247 has been deployed successfully at various research centers and it features a central unit connected to a number of realistic interfaces such as BTEs, ITEs, or typical wearables. In this CRP renewal we upgrade the technology to support demanding machine learning algorithms interfaced almost inconspicuously to a number of EEG and EOG electrodes to extract perfectly speech from noise.

"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individuals’ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Engineering', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Hour', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Inherited', 'Intake', 'Iontophoresis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reading', 'Sampling', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Study Subject', 'Sweat Glands', 'Sweat test', 'System', 'Technology', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'dietary supplements', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microsensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'precision nutrition', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'remote patient monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796
"A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change ABSTRACT  The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that impact a range of human behaviors including arm function, speech, and vision. Tools that can quantify motor deficits in a granular and objective manner are needed to support early recognition of clinical disease onset, more sensitively determine efficacy of a therapy, and make personalized predictions about disease progression. Such tools are needed for upcoming disease modifying clinical trials in SCAs, in order to reduce sample size and trial duration and better understand how a given therapy modifies human behaviors. Powered off of the currently available primary outcome measures for these rare ataxias, clinical trials are likely to face patient recruitment and retention challenges, especially with multiple co-occurring clinical trials. These challenges may impede or slow our ability to successfully discover therapies for our patients.  We have recently made substantial progress in capturing multimodal behavioral signals from speech, eye movement, and arm motor function using everyday technologies: a microphone, iPhone camera, and computer mouse. Our initial data indicate that these scalable technologies have strong potential to extend current clinical assessments in ataxia and that our novel machine learning approach for generating disease severity estimates performs better than the traditional regression model approach. Our algorithms are able to quantitatively identify signs of ataxia and parkinsonism in SCA individuals' speech and arm movement, even when absent on clinical assessment. Furthermore, our novel severity estimation algorithm enabled measurement of disease progression more sensitively than clinical scales. We propose to substantially expand longitudinal data collection and further develop our novel analytic approaches to train more powerful models for characterizing and quantifying human motor behavior. The technologies developed have the potential to facilitate clinical trials aimed at bringing disease modifying therapies to individuals with SCA. While the focus of this project is on SCA, the novel methodological approaches and data generated are applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases affecting movement and speech. Furthermore, this project will bring new insight into how motor abnormalities initially arise and progress.  The overall goal of this project is to develop widely available systems for improving early detection of clinical disease onset, severity assessment, and prognostication of spinocerebellar ataxias while simultaneously learning how these disorders impact fine-grained motor behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There are currently no disease modifying therapies for the spinocerebellar ataxias. One important barrier for development of new therapies for spinocerebellar ataxia and other neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of tools to objectively and sensitively measure a beneficial clinical response to a drug. This project aims to develop systems based on everyday technologies and sophisticated computational methods to provide accessible tools for early detection, precise severity measurement, and prediction of disease progression in spinocerebellar ataxias.",A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change,10210639,R01NS117826,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning Disorders', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Sample Size', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Vision', 'arm', 'arm function', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'illness length', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'microphone', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oculomotor', 'open source', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555308
"Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Advances in machine learning and low-cost, wearable sensors offer a practical method for understanding, assessing, and intervening for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) in everyday spaces. We propose to create a Behaviorome research program that will create ground-breaking methods for building health-predictive models from wearable sensor data by mapping patterns of behavior using machine learning and pervasive computing technologies. This program will create innovative multidisciplinary ideas to address NIH ADRD Milestone 11.c, Embed wearable technologies/pervasive computing in existing and new clinical research. Our research program builds on a history of interdisciplinary research contributions in areas including human behavior modeling from longitudinal sensor data and design of novel assessment and intervention mechanisms. We propose to design and validate methods for mapping a human behaviorome “in the wild”, automatically assessing cognitive and functional health from behavior markers, scaling technologies through machine learning, linking health and behavior with their influences, and closing the loop with automated interventions. Similarly, our mentoring program builds on experience training students and early- career investigators to become leaders in the field of gerontechnology. We will recruit and train graduate students and early-stage researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, to grow an institutional multidisciplinary Behaviorome research program and to establish new research programs that contribute to the targeted Milestone. We will scale the impact of mentoring by establishing a webinar series and creating youtube videos that highlight and explain breakthroughs in the design and application of Behaviorome research. Results of this program will include scripts and templates to construct a behaviorome with resource- limited wearable devices, scale data and models to large diverse populations, integrate data with multiple information sources (e.g., genetics), automate health assessment and intervention, and create understandable explanations of data and models. These will contribute to existing clinical studies such as the clinician-in-the- loop smart home, digital memory notebook, and pervasive computing measures of functional performance. Furthermore, they will lead to new clinical studies that formalize connections between health and its influences, exploration of the impact of ethnicity and the built environment on health, and the design of ADRD interventions for medication adherence, task prompting, and negative interaction de-escalation. The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on detecting and assessing ADRDs within a person's everyday environment using wearable sensing and pervasive computing methods that have not been investigated in prior work. Additionally, the mentoring steps will pave the way for a new generation of researchers to offer improved methods of addressing the need to understand, assess, and intervene for ADRDs in everyday settings, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to build a multidisciplinary research and mentoring program that will design wearable sensing and pervasive computing technologies to improve detection, assessment and intervention for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Built on a foundation of existing research and mentoring collaboration between computer science and neuropsychology, we will design and validate methods to analyze the relationship between ADRDs and behavior. We will create robust health-predictive models from longitudinal sensor data collected in naturalistic settings and will connect health and behavior with multiple influences, such as genetics and environment, to advance quality of care and reduce functional disability associated with ADRDs.","Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs",10168052,R35AG071451,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'built environment', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'graduate student', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'student training', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'webinar']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,918000
"An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms An intracortical brain-computer interface (iBCI) is used to record electrical signals directly from a person's brain, predict their intention from those signals, then control an assistive device (e.g., a computer cursor, prosthetic limb, or powered wheelchair) according to those intentions. This technology enables severely paralyzed people to interact with the world. However, designing robust algorithms to extract intent from recordings of single neurons is extremely challenging, in large part because of the very limited access to humans, or even monkeys, from whom these invasive recordings can be made. In this project, we will develop a model iBCI system that generates real-time biomimetic neural data by capturing the high-degree-of-freedom finger movements of able-bodied human subjects. To accomplish this, we will construct a modular recurrent neural network (RNN). The RNN will be trained to predict the motor cortex activity of a monkey from the monkey's own finger kinematics. Small modules of the RNN will be interchanged according the particular animal or recording session to model the high inter-session variability present in motor cortex. Once the modular RNN is trained, its weights will be fixed and human finger kinematics will be used as the RNN inputs, which will generate subject-controlled emulated neural activity. The emulated neural activity can be passed to iBCI decoding algorithms that control computer cursors or other physical devices, allowing human subjects to interact directly with decoders in real time, closed-loop conditions. We call this model system the jaBCI. The jaBCI is low cost and noninvasive, making it possible to rapidly test and design novel iBCI decoders using statistically rigorous sample sizes. The project will be executed in close collaboration with intracortical microelectrode array data expert Dr. Lee Miller at Northwestern University. Dr. Miller's lab, with the help of our consultant Dr. Mathis, will obtain simultaneous finger kinematics and neural activity of monkey subjects that will serve as the training data for the RNN component of the iBCI model. We will validate the emulated neural data generated by the jaBCI across many measures to ensure the model captures as many features of intracortical data as possible. These include comparing the model and actual iBCI in subject performance, learning rates, control strategies, neural variation across days, neural firing rate distributions, and low-dimensional neural dynamics. With the validated model, we will undertake a study to rigorously evaluate the highest performing, current state-of-the-art iBCI decoders. This will yield useful insight into the features of decoders that yield the greatest performance gains, overcoming the current impossibility to compare iBCI decoders in well-controlled studies using more than two or three naïve human subjects. We will also use the iBCI model to evaluate novel decoder designs, and to determine the features of neural dynamics that are consistent across common iBCI tasks to help focus decoder development on those features. Narrative Brain-computer interfaces are systems that translate the electrical neural signatures of thought into instructions for a personal computer or powered wheelchair, which is an incredibly useful technology to help paralyzed people regain some independence and ability to communicate. This work would develop a tool that scientists can use to design, test, and optimize the sophisticated computer programs that translate brain signals into device instructions without having to implant electrodes into a person's brain until the program is completed and rigorously tested. This tool could increase the pace of discovery and development of brain-computer interfaces.",An Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface Model for High Efficiency Development of Closed-Loop Neural Decoding Algorithms,10183350,R01NS109257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biological Models', 'Biomimetics', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Finger joint structure', 'Fingers', 'Freedom', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Industry Standard', 'Injury', 'Instruction', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Limb Prosthesis', 'Limb structure', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Cortex', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Operating System', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paralysed', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Personal Power', 'Persons', 'Posture', 'Powered wheelchair', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Robotics', 'Rotation', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Work', 'brain computer interface', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'computer program', 'cost', 'design', 'finger movement', 'head-to-head comparison', 'high dimensionality', 'human subject', 'human-in-the-loop', 'innovation', 'insight', 'invention', 'kinematics', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'skill acquisition', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,334572
"A new mechanistic and technological framework for uncovering the spinal cord neural systems important for functional recovery after injury Project Summary and Abstract Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) are improving, but little is known about the neural systems that would be most effective to target such interventions. Sensory based rehabilitation suggests a strong link between cutaneous and proprioceptive sensory neuron activity and motor recovery. Previous experiments provide strong support for the intermediate zone (IZ) of the spinal cord (SC) as an important site mediating this recovery. However, few studies have assessed the role of specific IZ neurons in functional recovery. Key barriers to progress include lack of characterization of specific cell types within the IZ and a paucity of tools to visualize circuits and test their functions in motor performance and recovery following SCI. Our lab combines sophisticated mouse genetic approaches with sensitive motor movement tracking to understand how sensory information is encoded by the SC to influence behavior. Using this approach, we uncovered that intermediate zone (IZ) parvalbumin positive interneurons (PVs) are important for tactile motor responses and locomotion. We hypothesize that IZ-PVs process sensory information to activate specific muscle groups during locomotion and that they play a critical role in activity-based functional recovery following SCI. The ability to identify circuits important for functional recovery relies on how accurately we can quantify differences in behavioral outcomes. We are implementing an unsupervised approach using 3-D pose dynamics and artificial intelligence (AI) to characterize both sensitive behavioral biomarkers and uncover key spinal cord circuits important for the recovery process. Interventions that increase plasticity and regeneration are improving, and this project both identifies the neural systems and synaptic mechanisms that would be most effective to target such interventions and establishes an AI-based platform for fast, reliable and unbiased quantification of motor recovery in rodents. Thus, this project makes original and important contributions to the field of spinal cord research in ways that are specifically aligned with central missions of the NINDS. Moreover, our experimental scrutiny at both the neural and behavioral levels establishes a critical foundation for developing a leading research program and securing independent award funding studying the spinal cord circuits important for sensorimotor function and recovery following SCI. To this end, I have developed a thorough and pragmatic career development plan supported by a strong committee of mentors with extensive track records of laboratory and departmental level mentoring and distinguished portfolios of SCI-specific grant support from the NIH, DoD and private foundations. My career development activities will be focused on four aspects of my academic success. 1) Mentorship and guidance focused on laboratory management. 2) Development and growth of my independent research program and award funding, with a focus on SCI research gap-based training. 3) Navigating institutional responsibilities and fulfilling requirements for promotion and tenure. 4) Expanding my scientific network and profile.

"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",10188391,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2021,289385
"Robotically Augmented Mental Practice for Neuromotor Facilitation SUMMARY Upper limb motor function is often impaired due to neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. The ultimate objective is to innovate effective motor rehabilitation for enhancing clinical outcomes in stroke populations by discovering and applying scientific mechanisms and developing new engineering technologies to facilitate neuromotor adaptation. In stroke rehabilitation, mental practice, such as motor imagery and action observation, is a very effective intervention when performed appropriately. The challenge is that performance quality and efficacy of mental practice are highly variable and can be compromised. It is hypothesized that control and observation of robotic grasp and release actions via synergistic proximal muscle activation will increase neuromotor excitability of the non-activated distal muscles and hand function due to cognitive engagement with the externally present and visible robotic prosthesis. The Specific Aim of this proof of concept and feasibility study is to develop and test robotically augmented mental practice with synergistic proximal muscles for neuromotor facilitation of hand muscles. A robotically augmented mental practice will be developed for individuals to grasp and release an object by controlling the associated actions of a sound- generating robotic prosthesis utilizing surface electromyography (EMG) of shoulder/trunk muscles with deep learning algorithms. To demonstrate the proof of concept of increased neuromotor excitability and hand performance in able-bodied adults, transcranial magnetic stimulation will be applied to the motor cortex for the non-activated hand muscles and reaction time and maximal voluntary contraction performances will be tested with a finger in various practice conditions. The feasibility and possible trends in stroke survivors with upper extremity disabilities will also be examined. The project will be performed at the Georgia Institute of Technology by an interdisciplinary team of experts in fields directly related to the study: an applied physiologist, mechanical and biomedical engineers, a physical therapist, and a clinical neuroscientist. The successful completion of the study will provide augmented mental practice for neuromotor facilitation for distal muscles, and evidence for efficacy will be provided in able-bodied adults and feasibility in post-stroke individuals. The results will lead to the development of a more effective priming intervention before physical practice that can facilitate functional improvement as part of stroke rehabilitation. This project will develop and test a new paradigm of motor imagery for facilitating neuromotor excitability and performance of distal muscles in the upper limb by adopting robotic prosthesis and integrating proven procedures for neuromotor facilitation. In this paradigm, individuals will interact with a robotic prosthesis by controlling the activation of the shoulder/trunk muscles that are functionally associated with the distal hand muscles. The development of this paradigm and its integration with able-bodied and post-stroke disabled individuals will open new scientific and clinical concepts and studies on augmented motor imagery, which can lead to the development of effective rehabilitation strategies for individuals with neuromotor impairment, such as hemiparetic stroke survivors.",Robotically Augmented Mental Practice for Neuromotor Facilitation,10301588,R21NS118435,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Auditory', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Digit structure', 'Disabled Persons', 'Distal', 'Electromyography', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Extensor', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Film', 'Fingers', 'Hand', 'Hand functions', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prosthesis', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reaction Time', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Institute', 'Robotics', 'Shoulder', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Upper Extremity', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Visual', 'Wireless Technology', 'arm', 'base', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'functional improvement', 'grasp', 'hand dysfunction', 'hemiparetic stroke', 'improved', 'innovation', 'long-term rehabilitation', 'mental practice', 'motor recovery', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'neurophysiology', 'physical therapist', 'post stroke', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'robot control', 'sound', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'trend', 'virtual', 'visual motor']",NINDS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2021,407538
"An Open Source Simulator for Multi Degree-Of-Freedom Brain-Machine Interfaces PROJECT SUMMARY For millions with movement disorders including paralysis and ALS, intracortical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) are an emerging technology that aims to restore lost motor function and communication. The main component of a BMI is a decoder algorithm that translates neural activity from motor areas of the brain into the kinematics of a prosthetic device. Due to the complexity of these systems, which includes the BMI user interacting with the decoded kinematics in a closed-feedback loop, current technology requires expensive and invasive experiments to design, optimize, and validate decoder algorithms. The need for such experiments (1) results in slow develop- ment and evaluation of decoder algorithms, and (2) limits the scope of people who can work on these problems to a small group of nonhuman primate and clinical trial labs. As a consequence, BMIs have remained in pilot clinical trials since their ﬁrst reported demonstration in 2004. We propose a new open-source simulator for multiple degree-of-freedom (DOF) BMI systems. The goals of this simulator are to (1) reduce the time it takes to evaluate and optimize BMI algorithms from months to minutes, and (2) signiﬁcantly expand the community of researchers who develop testable algorithms for BMIs. To build the simulator, we propose neural encoding models that generate synthetic motor cortical activity for multiple DOF tasks. This is possible because neural population activity is relatively low-dimensional and has dynamics, which can be learned via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We build our neural simulators using data collected from human clinical trials during point-to-point multi-DOF reaches. We also propose to develop new models of human controllers. This solves an important problem in BMIs: users learn new control strategies when controlling a particular BMI decoder algorithm. Our simulator uses deep imitation and reinforcement learning to solve this problem. It is constrained through imitation learning to perform actions like a human. It is optimized through reinforcement learning to explore new strategies – under the constraint of being human-like – to optimally control the BMI. Together, we expect these innovations will result in a purely software simulator that accurately predicts BMI performance and enables design and optimization. This tool will be open-sourced and available to all, enabling widespread development of BMIs. PROJECT NARRATIVE For people who have lost the ability to move due to movement disorders, including paralysis and ALS, intracor- tical brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to restore movement and communication by directly decoding neural activity from motor regions of the brain. We propose to accelerate and democratize BMI research by building a computational simulator, implemented entirely in software, that enables researchers around the world to design and optimize BMI decoder algorithms. We expect this tool will reduce BMI evaluation time from months to min- utes, and by being widely available and open source to all, considerably increase the intracortical BMI research community.",An Open Source Simulator for Multi Degree-Of-Freedom Brain-Machine Interfaces,10183995,R01NS121097,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosciences', 'Paralysed', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Prosthesis', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Robotics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'human-in-the-loop', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'mind control', 'neurosurgery', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'open source', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,394812
