"Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY Prenatal and postnatal childhood exposure to metals, essential and non-essential, is ubiquitous via dietary and environmental sources. Heavy metals, including lead and methylmercury, are well characterized as potent neurotoxicants, associated with lower cognition and poor learning abilities. Yet, our understanding of the neurotoxicity and joint impact of many other common prenatal and postnatal metal exposures remains extremely limited. Even less is known about the combined impact of exposure to multiple metals during fetal development or postnatal exposure during early childhood, or the influence of other environmental mixtures such as nutrients, which may have shared sources, on the neurodevelopmental effects of metals. To address this significant gap, our long-term goal is to quantify the neurocognitive impact of ubiquitous prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and identify cord blood DNA methylation biomarkers that can reconstruct prenatal environmental exposures and predict future neurocognitive development in children. We will test if objective measures of key prenatal maternal nutrients, such as folate, vitamin B12 and essential metals attenuate or mitigate the neurotoxicity of metal mixtures. To accomplish this goal, we will leverage resources from an established U.S. pre-birth cohort, Project Viva. In this cohort, we have measured concentrations for 14 prenatal maternal metals in the first trimester of pregnancy and blood samples collected in early-childhood (~3 years) ready for metal testing as well as ready to use genome-wide cord blood DNA methylation screens. Children have been followed prospectively and undergone detail testing for neurodevelopment in early (~3 years of age) and mid-childhood (~7 years). We hypothesize that prenatal maternal 1st trimester and postnatal early childhood neurotoxic metal mixtures are associated with poor neurodevelopment in early and mid-childhood (Aim 1), and that prenatal first trimester maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and blood concentration of essential metals protect against prenatal metal mixture neurotoxicity (Aim 2). We also hypothesize that DNA methylation marks measured in umbilical cord blood at birth can reconstruct prenatal exposure to metals (Aim 3.a) and that cord blood DNAm marks predict future neurocognitive development in early and mid-childhood (Aim 3.b). By testing longitudinal associations in a large cohort of children with detail cognitive assessments as well as objective biomarkers of metals and nutrients, we will overcome limitations currently faced by existing studies testing few exposures simultaneously. We will use novel statistical methodology to model prenatal and postnatal environmental mixtures and machine learning algorithms to build epigenetic predictors of exposure and neurodevelopment. This research will provide a comprehensive quantification of the cognitive burden of prenatal and postnatal mixtures, the development of biomarkers of exposure and neurodevelopment and the identification of potential prenatal nutritional intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood decrements in neurocognitive development result in large population burden and expenditure. The proposed research will identify the extent to which prenatal and postnatal neurotoxic mixtures as well as key prenatal nutrients jointly influence neurocognitive development in childhood. This research will provide early life biomarkers that reconstruct prenatal exposures and predict childhood neurocognitive performance with the goal of developing novel and early-life interventions to protect children.",Prenatal and Postnatal Exposure to Environmental Mixtures: Neurodevelopment and DNA Methylation Biomarkers,10186748,R01ES031259,"['3 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood specimen', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Neurotoxicity', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Consequentialism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Expenditure', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Folic Acid', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heavy Metals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Life', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methylmercury Compounds', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vitamin B 12', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'biomarker development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'dietary', 'early childhood', 'exposed human population', 'genome-wide', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'learning ability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'methylation biomarker', 'neurocognitive test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal environmental exposure', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'routine screening', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2021,425421
"Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure Abstract As a constitutent component of CIFASD4, this project will focus on earlier detection of the neurofacial effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Four topics of the Request for Application (RFA) will be targeted: a) improved FAS/FASD facial recognition through 3D photography and computer analyses in individuals of different age groups; b) the utility of prenatal ultrasound as a screening or diagnostic modality; c) 3D facial imaging during the neonatal period to detect more subtle facial features affected by prenatal alcohol exposure; d) innovative uses of technologies, including handheld devices with apps, to screen for dysmorphology. Previously, we have implemented methods and associated software for analyzing postnatal face shape for the detection of the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Although effective in their accuracy, they rely on the use of expensive and relatively clumsy 3D cameras for which not insignificant training is required. New methods of 2D image analysis are available, mobile device acquisition of 3D images is imminent and online recruitment to clinical research is becoming more common place. Finally, state-of-the-art machine learning methods are proving effective in large-scale analysis of ultrasound and MRI data. To accomplish our goals, we propose the following specific aims: 1. Automated screening of facial images for effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with potential for on-line and  mobile device use and integration of genetic, behavioral and cognitive data; 2. Fetal ultrasound analysis to detect facial, cranial and neural effects of prenatal alcohol exposure with  neonatal follow-up; 3. Algorithm and software development to improve current analysis of face-brain-alcohol interactions. Achieving aim 1 will dramatically impact access to validated facial screening for prenatal alcohol exposure. Successful demonstration of aim 2 will achieve the earliest possible diagnosis enabling further research on interventions but also anticipatory neonatal management. Progress in aim 3 will enhance face-brain morphometric analyses in collaboration with other CIFASD partners (U01:Parnell/Eberhart, U01:Wozniak). We will work collaboratively with consortium partners who will recruit subjects and provide facial and ultrasound images (U01: Chambers; U01: Coles; U01: Mattson; U01: Weinberg; U01: Wozniak). We will co- operate on the analysis of images arising from basic science partners focusing on the use of animal models. We will rely on research resources for validation of postnatal screening tools (R24 Dysmorphology - Jones) and online/app development and data management (R24 Informatics - Barnett). Project Narrative The goal of this project is to develop new methods for screening for the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. It will exploit the wide availability and convenience of smartphone and tablet devices to detect the facial effects in children and adults and new ways of analyzing ultrasound images to detect facial and brain effects in the fetus. Our aim is to establish earlier detection so as to allow earlier intervention to improve outcome.",Image Analysis of Neurofacial Effects of Prenatal Alcohol  Exposure,10174601,U01AA014809,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', '3D ultrasound', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Caucasians', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cephalic', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Fetus', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Neonatal', 'Nose', 'Photography', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pregnancy', 'Preparation', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Syndrome', 'Tablet Computer', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'age group', 'alcohol exposure', 'algorithm development', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'caudate nucleus', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'experience', 'fetal', 'follow-up', 'handheld equipment', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'mouse model', 'neonatal period', 'novel', 'operation', 'postnatal', 'potential biomarker', 'prenatal', 'prenatal testing', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'software development', 'tobacco exposure']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD,U01,2021,225264
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,10197069,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,679645
"Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children Maternal substance use disorders are a substantial public health concern and the neurological consequences of prenatal exposure are a major threat to the long-term health of offspring. Globally, prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is between 2-7 and 20-50 per 1000, respectively. By contrast, in certain high-risk communities in South Africa, prevalence is reported to be as high as 63 and 155 per 1000, respectively. Though prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is known to affect the central nervous system, to date, little data exists in respect of the impact of PAE in early childhood, before both higher-level brain networks are established and other potentially confounding post- natal environmental influences have come into play. For neurodevelopmental disorders, studies have consistently shown that early intervention, based on detection and targeted interventions, leads to better long-term outcomes. We aim to address this precise gap in knowledge by imaging the brain and 3D face across the FASD continuum to investigate early biomarkers, trajectories and functional correlates of PAE in a cohort followed prospectively from birth to age 6 years. Data: Our cohort includes a well characterized subsample of children (PAE and healthy controls) enrolled in the Drakenstein Child Health Study in Cape Town, South Africa, who have been scanned as neonates and at 2-3 years of age. Preliminary published data shows highly significant relationships between PAE and regional gray and white matter changes, already discernible in newborns, well before the age FASD is typically diagnosed. An additional longitudinal assessment at 6-years will yield a unique FASD sample with 3 distinct time points (infants, toddlers and children), allowing characterization of brain and face morphology and brain structure and function in this previously understudied early developmental period. This proposal addresses fundamental gaps concerning the presence, timing and regional specificity of altered brain morphology and structural and functional connectivity in association with the effects of PAE on the developing brain from birth to 6 years, and the relationships with facial dysmorphology. The research team has successfully gathered data from the proposed cohort as neonates and at 2–3 years of age. The benefits of extending this research to a subsequent imaging time-point, with a larger range of developmental and neurobehavioral assessments, provides an unprecedented opportunity to determine longitudinal effects of PAE on the trajectory of the developing brain in these critical early years, the links between neural and face predictors of PAE and the long-term clinical significance of these findings. This research will illuminate early neurodevelopmental mechanisms leading to subsequent behavioral and neurological disturbances, which may allow opportunities for targeting interventions when brain plasticity is still relatively fluid. This project might also lead to new strategies for early diagnosis using both face and brain biomarkers. Project Narrative Fetal exposure of the brain to alcohol can trigger brain abnormalities that unfold over a lifetime with severe consequences both for the affected individual and for society at large. To date, these brain abnormalities and associated deficits and behaviors have mostly been studied in late childhood or later, with very few studies following the consequences of well documented fetal alcohol exposure as they develop in the same individual across time in early childhood when the brain is most responsive to potential treatments. This project will extend an ongoing study of children with fetal alcohol exposure, already characterized as newborns and at age 2-3 to add assessments of the brain and behavior at age 6 and will explore alcohol-induced facial abnormalities as a complementary predictor of brain problems. !",Tracking and Prediction of Early Brain-Face Biomarkers of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure from Neonates to Children,10201416,R01AA026834,"['2 year old', '3 year old', '3-Dimensional', '6 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neonatal', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'alcohol exposure', 'antenatal', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data fusion', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'efficacy testing', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal alcohol use', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal depression', 'multimodality', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'prenatal exposure', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'shape analysis', 'statistics', 'white matter', 'white matter change']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,509663
"Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria Project Summary: FASD is a serious public health crisis with 80,000 to 120,000 U.S. pregnancies per year at high risk. FASD diagnostic clinics are very sparse, difficult to sustain because of diagnostic complexity, unable to meet demand, and plagued by disagreement about diagnostic criteria. A recent comparison of five FASD diagnostic systems acknowledged that the lack of objective biomarkers for prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) contributes to disagreement in the field. The goal of the proposed work is to develop and refine neuroimaging methods capable of identifying subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE. A critical component of this project will be to apply these refined neuroimaging “biomarkers” to examine the validity and performance of the most commonly-used FASD diagnostic criteria (alcohol exposure, dysmorphology, growth, and cognition). The proposed project will push the development of imaging methods and will also include an examination of the sensitivity and specificity of current diagnostic factors. The aims are: 1) perform a comprehensive characterization of the FASD “connectome” using state-of- the-art Human Connectome Project (HCP) methods in children with PAE, 2) evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of FASD diagnostic criteria to provide objective evaluation of FASD criteria (which remain in flux), 3) characterize relationships between connectomics and cognitive functioning, & 4) examine the developmental course of functional connectivity, white matter connectivity, cortical gyrification, and intra-cortical myelin. Participants will undergo longitudinal re-assessment at 15-months to match the new HCP-development paradigm (HCP-D) to allow for comparison to a large normative dataset being collected in Minnesota as part of the HCP-D project. We will capitalize on the developments spawned from the $40 million HCP and will benefit from evaluating the brains of children with PAE against the backdrop of a very large HCP normative dataset (n=1300). The proposed study will examine 45 participants with PAE and 45 matched controls, ages 8-16, all of whom will be evaluated by the CIFASD dysmorphology project. Participants will undergo MRI scans at the University of Minnesota's Center for Magnetic Resonance Research (CMRR) at baseline and again 15 months later. The imaging protocol, which contains very high resolution structural, diffusion- weighted, and fMRI scans will evaluate cortical gyrification, intra-cortical myelin, white matter connectivity, and functional connectivity. Data from the HCP-D project will be used as secondary “normative” comparison dataset. We expect to find a number of subtle neurodevelopmental abnormalities in PAE that have not previously been observed and we will characterize individuals with these metrics. Individual identification of neurodevelopmental anomalies will then allow us to probe the screening properties of commonly used FASD diagnostic criteria and to test the performance of Dr. Mattson's Decision Tree model for rapidly identifying children with developmental effects of PAE. The study will have direct implications for FASD clinical practice and public policies as it will provide objective data about the relative advantages and disadvantages of individual diagnostic elements and it will allow for comparisons of competing FASD diagnostic systems. The proposed project aims to use the most advanced MRI brain imaging techniques available to address a highly practical problem faced by clinicians and public health officials: the lack of consensus about diagnostic criteria for Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and the challenges of identifying individuals who are affected by prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) but do not have the physical characteristics upon which a diagnosis can be made. The proposed study will identify subtle brain anomalies in children with PAE with a level of sensitivity not previously attainable. The study will push forward our understanding of how PAE negatively affects the efficiency of the brain's networks. In addition, the study will use these brain imaging results to further refine the diagnostic criteria such that more children will be able to be properly identified as having a neurodevelopmental disorder as a result of PAE.",Multi-modal connectivity methods for the validation of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder diagnostic criteria,10169180,U01AA026102,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dysmorphology', 'Elements', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Myelin', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Public Policy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'connectome', 'diagnostic platform', 'diffusion weighted', 'executive function', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'performance tests', 'prisma', 'processing speed', 'screening', 'white matter']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2021,344735
"Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment. Abstract Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities, with prevalence estimates of 3-10/1000 individuals in the US and up to 80/1000 in endemic communities. The promise of an increasing number of interventions tailored to prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-related neurobehavioral deficits is limited by diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Currently known biomarkers of exposure are neither sensitive nor specific for neurobehavioral deficits, in part because not all exposed children are affected. There is, therefore, a critical need for biomarkers of effect to identify affected children who would benefit from early, tailored therapeutic interventions. A growing body of literature has demonstrated alcohol-induced alterations in epigenetic programming as an important potential mechanism in FASD, suggesting that such alterations may serve as biomarkers of effect. Imprinted genes comprise a unique subset of epigenetically regulated genes that is sensitive to prenatal insults. There is considerable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected by FASD and those seen in experimental animal models of imprinted gene dysregulation, including learning, memory, and attachment. In a prenatally- recruited, prospective longitudinal cohort, we recently found that PAE was associated with alterations in placental level of expression of 11 of 93 expressed imprinted genes. Expression changes for five of these genes statistically mediated effects of alcohol on postnatal growth, identifying these alterations as biomarkers of fetal alcohol growth restriction. Given the remarkable overlap between the neurobehavioral domains affected in FASD and those affected by alteration of imprinted gene expression in animal models, alcohol-induced alterations in placental imprinted gene expression may also provide biomarkers for FASD neurocognitive deficits. Although most epigenetic marks are specific to tissue-type and timing of exposure, genomic imprinting maps and our pilot data indicate that markers of imprinted gene dysregulation identified in placental tissue may be detected in blood samples obtained at older ages. The aims of this study are: (1) To characterize the fetal alcohol-related imprintome signature in the placenta and in blood samples obtained at 6 yr; (2) To identify alterations in imprinted gene level of expression and ICR methylation that can serve as biomarkers of effect; (3) To validate findings in Aims 1 and 2 in blood samples from a 2nd, independent cohort. The data for this study will come from two prospective longitudinal cohorts recruited from the Cape Coloured community in Cape Town, South Africa, where the prevalence of FASD is among the highest in the world. Results from this study will make it possible to identify affected children who would benefit from early therapeutic interventions but would likely not be detected by current diagnostic tools. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Despite widespread public health advisories, alcohol use during pregnancy persists in the U.S. and worldwide, making fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) the most common preventable cause of neurodevelopmental delay. The promise of an ever-increasing number of interventions tailored to FASD deficits is limited by difficulties in identifying fetal alcohol-related facial dysmorphology in infancy and early childhood, when interventions are most effective, and in children with alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder, in which neurodevelopmental impairment occurs in the absence of dysmorphic features. This proposal seeks to identify alterations in imprinted gene expression that can be used as biomarkers of adverse effect to identify infants and children with FASD who would benefit from therapeutic interventions but would probably not be detected by current diagnostic tools.",Identification of fetal alcohol-affected children: Alterations in imprinted gene expression and methylation as biomarkers of neurobehavioral and growth impairment.,10212186,R01AA027916,"['Adolescent', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Experimental Animal Model', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Growth Disorders', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methylation', 'Microcephaly', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Nursery Schools', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Placenta', 'Play', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'South Africa', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'early childhood', 'fetal', 'fetal diagnosis', 'gene function', 'imprint', 'infancy', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,584057
"Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver Intervention for FASD Project Summary/Abstract   Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) represent a major public health problem that affects up to 2 to 5

larger-­scale hybrid implementation-­effectiveness trial (n=120) with caregivers raising children (ages 3-­12) with  FASD. Implementation data will aid in identifying the patterns of app usage that relate to the greatest  improvements in child and caregiver outcomes. Study hypotheses are: 1) that caregivers will find the FMF  Connect intervention acceptable, with easy to access content and encouraging support from peer-­moderators;;  2) that greater usage of specific intervention components will relate to larger improvements in child and  caregiver outcomes;; 3) that caregivers who receive the FMF Connect intervention will have larger gains on  child and caregiver outcomes relative to a waitlist comparison group;; and 4) that an increase in  neurodevelopmental attributions for behavior will mediate intervention-­related improvements in parenting  efficacy and child behavior. Project findings will guide further app development both in terms of content and  technological advances to optimize intervention effects. Results of this study will further the overall strategic  aims of the Collaborative Initiative on FASD (CIFASD), which are to inform and develop effective interventions  for FASD. This project will also benefit from resources and collaborations within CIFASD to carry out the  proposed work, including recruitment of a diverse sample, diagnostic support, and outreach and dissemination.  This is one of the first studies to empirically test an mHealth intervention delivered by parents with peer-­ moderated support. It has the potential to reach many families raising children with FASD in need and could  reduce significant barriers to care, resulting in a greater public health impact.                   Project Narrative   The vast majority of families raising children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) cannot access  FASD-­informed interventions due to significant systems-­ and family-­level barriers. This project will develop and  evaluate the efficacy of a mobile health application to directly provide caregivers raising children with FASD  with evidence-­based content and peer-­moderated support to improve child and caregiver outcomes.                         ",Development and Evaluation of an Evidence-Based Mobile Health Caregiver

"Administrative Core of the CIFASD Project Summary/Abstract The Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD) is a multidisciplinary, international consortium of research projects and resource cores charged with improving prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD. The Administrative Resource Core of the CIFASD (AdminC) has led this consortium since it was first established in 2003 and plays a critical leadership role in the coordination of research efforts and ensuring progress toward consortium goals. CIFASD addresses issues related to prenatal alcohol exposure across the lifespan, using a range of interrelated clinical and preclinical research approaches. This iteration of the consortium consists of multiple collaborative components including four resource U24 cores (AdminC, Dysmorphology, Informatics, and Outreach/Dissemination), nine U01 research projects (clinical, basic science, and/or translational) and two exploratory/developmental UH2 projects. One goal of the CIFASD is to improve identification of individuals who have been affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. This will be accomplished by assessing biomarkers, such as immune and miRNA profiles, and by using neuroimaging techniques that may be more sensitive to subtle pathology seen in individuals who do not meet the diagnostic criteria for FAS. In addition, CIFASD will develop novel tools, such as 3D facial and neurobehavioral screening, which can be assessed remotely and made more universally accessible through eHealth. The use of telemedicine will also provide access to more detailed dysmorphology evaluations. Another goal is to identify risk and resiliency factors, including genetic influences that will help with understanding the mechanisms of alcohol's damaging effects and also lead to more targeted interventions. A third goal is to better understand the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on consequences across the lifespan, including adulthood. Finally, an intervention for improving outcomes will be modified to a mobile platform, so that it can reach larger populations of individuals with FASD and their families. Collectively, these projects have the potential for moving the FASD field forward, improving the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of FASD and serving a wide audience with the technologies available in eHealth. The Specific Aims of the AdminC are to: 1) Provide scientific and administrative direction, leadership and oversight to CIFASD; 2) Facilitate communication among the various projects and the dissemination of results; 3) Assist with data management strategies; 4) Provide annual evaluations of progress; and 5) Provide assistance to projects with implementing eHealth technology. The AdminC provides the foundation for the interactive and supportive framework of CIFASD by establishing regular communications with all members through monthly conference calls and biannual meetings; leading the Steering Committee in the establishment and implementation of CIFASD priorities and policies; supporting the Science Advisory Board with its evaluations of progress on each component as well as the overall mission of CIFASD; as well as serving as the liaison between the consortium's project scientists and its NIAAA advisors. Project Narrative The consequences resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are wide-ranging and a major and costly public health problem. The goal of the CIFASD consortium is to enhance the identification and treatment of FASD utilizing a multidisciplinary approach consisting of both basic science and clinical research. The collaborations among research projects will allow CIFASD to improve the diagnosis and treatment of FASD, moving the field forward in ways that could not be easily achieved by individual projects.",Administrative Core of the CIFASD,10169172,U24AA014811,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain imaging', 'Cellular Phone', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dysmorphology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Physical assessment', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Tablets', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'behavioral study', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'data management', 'diagnostic screening', 'drinking', 'eHealth', 'epidemiology study', 'fetal', 'forging', 'health care service', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'meetings', 'member', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical research', 'program dissemination', 'recruit', 'repository', 'resilience', 'screening', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,428830
"Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs PROJECT SUMMARY Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important public health outcomes. Loss of functioning early in life due to toxins, such as metals, can have lifelong impacts. The prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders of fetal origin is impeded by the lack of objective tools for early detection of susceptible individuals. We will address the role of prenatal metal exposure on neurodevelopment, integrating this work with the overall goal of understanding how metal exposures impact placental cues, specifically release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which facilitate and direct neurodevelopment. It has been shown that placental trophoblasts actively release EVs, i.e., nano-sized membrane-bound vesicles, in both the maternal and fetal circulation. EVs shuttle cargoes of bioactive molecules from trophoblasts to recipient cells, such as microRNAs (miRNAs) that prime maternal tissues to support fetal development. In the fetal circulation, EVs can cross the blood-brain barrier, particularly in prenatal life when the barrier around the fetal brain is still porous and permeable. Not only is the placenta a primary target of metal toxicities, data show that EV signaling is sensitive to environmental influences, including metals. No study to date has investigated whether exposures to metals during the prenatal period determine alterations of circulating EV signals that, in turn, may help to diagnose and predict alterations in neurodevelopment. Notably, many placental miRNAs are known to regulate neurodevelopment and have significant overrepresentation of Gene Ontology terms associated with neurogenesis. We propose that in utero metal exposure disrupt normal miRNA expression in placental tissue and their release in circulating EVs, thus altering neural stem cell proliferation, self-renewal and differentiation during fetal development. In turn, we propose that EV-packaged miRNAs in the maternal circulation in pregnancy reflect early biological settings of this fetal programming. We will conduct a coordinated series of human studies and in-vitro experiments to: 1) characterize the risk for maladaptive neurodevelopment from prenatal exposure to toxic metals and their mixtures; 2) identify EV-encapsulated miRNAs released by the placenta in response to metals by accessing this novel form of prenatal signaling through a maternal blood draw during pregnancy, cord blood, and placental biopsy at birth; and 3) conduct in-vitro experiments to assess whether EV-encapsulated miRNAs are released by trophoblasts after treatment with individual metals or their mixtures; and whether miRNAs in EVs released from metal-treated trophoblasts alter critical functions of neural stem cells. We leverage the PRogramming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) cohort with prospective assessment of behavioral disinhibition in N=470 children followed to age 48 months. While we propose underlying theoretical pathways, the primary goal is to search for biomarkers of early risk. However, findings may also advance our understanding of molecular pathways that influence neurodevelopmental risk, which will be critical for the development of preventative strategies and possible therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal integrates experimental and clinical research on in utero metal exposures, molecular epigenetic biomarkers of placental origin and neurobehavior to create novel, cutting edge cross disciplinary research on neuroprogramming. This is a significant research advance that has the potential to identify early pregnancy biomarkers of placental/fetal health and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that identify those at heightened risk from environmental exposures, so that interventions may be applied early to promote optimal development and improved health.",Prenatal metal mixtures and neurodevelopment:  Role of placental extracellular microRNAs,10163057,R01ES030302,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Arsenic', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Cadmium', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Research', 'Coupled', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Diseases', 'Fetal health', 'Fetus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Manganese', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Membrane', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Physiology', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Temperament', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxin', 'Transfection', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'behavioral disinhibition', 'blood-brain barrier crossing', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'early childhood', 'early detection biomarkers', 'early pregnancy', 'epigenetic marker', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'extracellular vesicles', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'intergenerational', 'loss of function', 'metal poisoning', 'nanosized', 'nerve stem cell', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral test', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurogenesis', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'overexpression', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prenatal risk factor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'self-renewal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem cell differentiation', 'stem cell proliferation', 'tool', 'toxic metal', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'trophoblast', 'vesicular release']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,642893
