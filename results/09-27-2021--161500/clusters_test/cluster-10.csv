"Fine-mapping psychiatric  disease variants that affect post-transcriptional gene regulation PROJECT SUMMARY Neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD) such as schizophrenia (SZ), autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and bipolar disorders (BD) are remarkably common, with SZ alone affecting nearly three million Americans. Despite more than fifty years of research, no cures exist for these conditions and the standard of treatment remains unsatisfactory. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) indicate that, in addition to highly penetrant rare mutations, NPD risk also reflects the impact of hundreds of common single nucleotide polymorphisms with small effect sizes. A major challenge in the field has been illuminating the pathways connecting these genetic variants (the vast majority of which fall in non-coding sequences) to target genes and causal cellular phenotypes. To understand how these myriad risk loci causally contribute to disease risk, it is essential to screen for putatively causal variant(s) and determine how they influence gene expression, which has been shown to be cell-type specific, as well as cellular function. Recent evidence has emerged indicating a substantial contribution of RNA splicing variation to heritability across many complex genetic diseases, including SZ. Based on our preliminary analyses and the work of others, we hypothesize that a substantial proportion of NPD GWAS loci exert their pathogenic effects on neuronal function by impacting RNA: its structure, modifications, protein interactions and splicing. To test this, we will apply novel tools and machine learning methods to predict and quantify RNA splicing in the largest SZ, ASD and BD GWAS, in order to predict splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs, Aim 1). To confirm true effects on exon inclusion independently in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons (i.e., the major cell-types impacted in NPD), up to several thousand of the predicted splice variants will be tested by a massively parallel reporter assay, MaPSy (Aim 2). Finally, in order to evaluate the cell-type-specific impact of putative causal sQTLs identified in Aims 1 and 2 on neuronal maturation and synaptic function, we will use CRISPR gene editing to engineer these mutations within human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based models of both neural cell types (Aim 3). Our overarching goal is to map and functionally evaluate the NPD-GWAS loci that impact alternative splicing and neuronal function. Our work may impact the field by delivering new insights into the role of common variants in NPD pathophysiology, which could inform ways of improving diagnostics, predicting clinical trajectories, and developing novel therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The causal role of neuropsychiatric disease risk variants putatively involved in RNA splicing on neuronal function has not been fully explored. By combining genetic fine-mapping, machine learning methods, massively parallel reporter assays, CRISPR-genetic engineering, and human induced pluripotent stem cell models, we propose to discover neuropsychiatric risk alleles predicted to impact alternative splicing and empirically test their molecular and functional impact in neurons. By better understanding the role of common variants in disease risk, we hope to improve diagnostics, predict clinical trajectories and develop novel therapeutic interventions.",Fine-mapping psychiatric  disease variants that affect post-transcriptional gene regulation,10415485,R56MH127844,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Assay', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'FURIN gene', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Introns', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spliced Genes', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'in silico', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mutant', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome prediction', 'overexpression', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'risk variant', 'standard care', 'stem cell biology', 'stem cell model', 'synaptic function', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R56,2021,772112
"Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants ABSTRACT Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing of complex diseases have revealed a plethora of disease risk variants, most of which lie in noncoding regions of DNA without easily interpretable function. A main functional mechanism of noncoding variants is to alter chromatin accessibility to transcription factors (TFs), thereby influencing gene expression. Predicting the effects of noncoding variants on TF binding and gene expression on a large scale is thus important but remains challenging. Available computational tools for predicting regulatory variants largely rely on TF-binding motif models and/or local chromatin modification features. Here, we aim to develop a novel computational framework to address two major limitations of these methods. First, given that known disease causal noncoding variants often reside outside of TF binding motifs, how can we improve the prediction of TF binding variants outside of motifs? For this, we plan to integrate TF ChIP-seq data with features that are important for TF binding but have not been considered in previous methods, in particular the DNA breathing dynamics (AIM1). DNA breathing reflects local transient opening of the DNA double helix due to thermal fluctuations. We have shown that genetic variants can affect nearby (up to a few hundred base pairs) DNA breathing dynamics that affect TF binding. Using TF ChIP-seq data, we will train models that predict specific TF binding variants in or outside TF motifs, incorporating DNA breathing dynamics with other features such as DNA shapes and cooperative TF binding. Secondly, given that chromatin features only show modest (<2-fold) enrichment of genetic variants associated with complex diseases or traits, how can we improve the prediction of regulatory variants? For this, we will build a computation model, considering the allele-specific chromatin accessibility (ASCA; i.e., two alleles of a heterozygous individual show read imbalance in chromatin accessibility assays) as a functional readout of a regulatory variant (AIM2). We have shown that neuronal ASCA SNPs are highly enriched for those implicated by schizophrenia (SZ) GWAS. Using neuronal ASCA data, we will train models that predict variants with regulatory effects, taking advantage of our TF-specific classifiers (from AIM1). As a proof of concept, the models will be applied to a large SZ GWAS dataset to predict putative causal regulatory variants. We will validate the effects of the predicted top-ranking regulatory SZ variants on gene expression in a well-powered hiPSC sample by combining multiplex CRISPR-based SNP editing and single-cell RNA-seq analysis (AIM3). For SNPs showing the strongest regulatory effects, we will further use CRISPR editing to verify the SNP effect on gene expression and disease-relevant neuronal phenotypes. Accurately predicting TF-affecting noncoding variants will enable better understanding of the large number of noncoding variants implicated in complex disorders and help formulate testable biological hypotheses, ultimately facilitating the development of targeted therapeutics. NARRATIVE We will develop novel computational methods and a cost-effective functional validation approach to systematically infer the effect of disease-associated noncoding variants on transcription factor binding and gene expression. Identifying the functional noncoding variants that are associated with disease risk will help illuminate causal molecular mechanisms, facilitating the clinical translation of genetic findings into disease risk prediction and treatment.",Integrating epigenomics with DNA breathing dynamics for human non-coding disease variants,10115126,R01MH116281,"['ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Adenine', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Breathing', 'Cell Line', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Classification', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Translation', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'chromatin modification', 'clinical translation', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost effective', 'disorder risk', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'support vector machine', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NIMH,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2021,605699
"Toward DNA Sequencing as a Primary Newborn Screen for Treatable Disorders not Amenable to Current Screening We propose to evaluate whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) as an approach for population screening of early-onset treatable recessively inherited conditions. Our analysis will be based on prior and additional work on the large, ancestrally diverse cohort of children constituting all 1,334 cases of inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) diagnosed by tandem mass spectrometry screening in California over an 8.5 year period.  Our prior analysis found that WES lacked adequate sensitivity and specificity to replace current newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). A screening-optimized DNA variant interpretation pipeline identified two known or likely pathogenic variants in most, but not all, affected cases. The pipeline was 88% sensitive and 98.4% specific, numbers too low to replace MS/MS. We found that 1/3 of known or likely pathogenic variants were novel, of which roughly 2/3 were missense. Adequate sensitivity and specificity therefore require accurate annotation of missense variants.  DNA variant annotation has focused on individual variants and is most applicable for dominant disorders for which pathogenicity is determined by a single variant. For recessive diseases, expression is determined by two variants on different chromosomes. We propose a new framework for disease prediction in recessive conditions, in which the bi-allelic variants, or diplotype, is used to assess pathogenicity. We will improve disease detection for autosomal recessive diseases through screening utilizing DNA sequencing by 1) improving interpretation of bi-allelic missense variants by using variant co-evolution, conservation, amino acid proximity and other features to derive a risk score, 2) considering both variants in recessive pathogenicity prediction, and 3) using the California newborn screening data set as a training set with a small number of positives for each disorder and a large number of controls (those cases positive for a different disease) to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict likelihood of disease. To address sensitivity, for 103 exome negative IEM cases from our data set we will fully interrogate the exome data, both for known IEM genes and also the entire exome to identify novel genes. Finally, for those remaining unsolved, we will perform WGS to identify additional causal variants. In so doing, we will also compare WES and WGS in terms of overall sensitivity and specificity for screening.  We anticipate that the proposed study will be a significant advance in assessing DNA sequencing as a newborn screening tool for those early-onset treatable diseases for which there is currently no screening test, leading to decreased death and disability. We propose to improve DNA sequencing as a newborn screening test by increasing the sensitivity and specificity to an acceptable level for those early-onset treatable disorders for which there is no alternative screening test. Given the large number of early-onset treatable conditions for which there is no test, or for which current testing continues to miss cases, DNA sequencing has the potential to have a large public health impact. Current newborn screening for multiple inborn errors of metabolism by tandem mass spectrometry is able to detect 40-50 disorders and is considered to be among the ten greatest public health successes of the first decade of the 21st century by the Centers for Disease Control; DNA based newborn screening could greatly increase the number of disorders identified and lead to timely and disease-specific interventions, thereby further decreasing death and disability due to treatable, early-onset recessive disorders.",Toward DNA Sequencing as a Primary Newborn Screen for Treatable Disorders not Amenable to Current Screening,10228509,R21HG011805,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'California', 'Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthase (Ammonia)', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chromosomes', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Homocystinuria', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Public Health', 'Recessive Genes', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urea cycle disorders', 'Variant', 'Vitamin B6', 'Work', 'base', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'disability', 'early onset', 'early screening', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'success', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2021,323000
"Novel statistical methods and tools to integrate multiple endophenotypes and functional annotation data to study the roles of rare variants in complex human diseases using sequencing data Project Summary In the past fifteen years, great efforts have been made to understand the genetic architecture of complex human diseases through genome-wide association studies. Although many genome-wide significant variants have been identified, the heritability or variance explained by these variants remains very small, suggesting substantial missing heritability that may yet be explained by common genetic variants with smaller effect sizes and/or rare and low frequency variants, which calls for the development and application of novel statistical methods to whole genome/exome sequencing data collected from deeply phenotyped cohorts. In this project, we will develop methods that leverage multiple correlated endophenotypes and further integrate functional annotation data to identify novel rare variants for complex traits. We will develop a set of new computational and analytical tools that are practically useful and broadly applicable to general sequencing studies, and the applications of our methods will likely identity novel rare variant associations and shed new lights on the genetics of cardiometabolic diseases. In Aim 1, we propose to develop novel statistical methods to integrate multiple endophenotypes to study the impact of rare variants on complex human diseases. Our methods will fill in the gap between the current practice of association studies and the practical needs of integrating endophenotypes for improved understanding and diagnosis of clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will extend the methods to meta-analyses across studies. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel kernel machine learning approach to integrating various functional information to annotate the whole genome region, and further integrate them to develop a dynamic whole-genome scan test to detect rare variant associations with multiple endophenotypes. We will leverage the NHLBI TOPMed whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and the UK Biobank whole exome sequencing (WES) data, and integrate the functional annotation data to identify and dissect the role of rare variants on the cardiometabolic traits (Aim 4). Our proposed work is cost-effective as it leverages the existing WGS/WES samples and functional annotation data while providing methods and tools that are broadly applicable to other studies, and builds on a strong team of scientists with proven track record in statistical genetics, large-scale genetic studies, and cardiometabolic traits. We expect our methods will lead to the discoveries of many more rare and low frequency variants for these traits. These results will offer new insights to help design more effective treatment and prevention strategies. All our proposed methods will be disseminated to the public through well-tested and publicly available software (Aim 5).

"Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics Project Summary  Hearing loss is the most common sensory deficit in humans. It is diagnosed in 1 in 500 newborns and affects half of all octogenarians. Although causality is multifactorial, in developed countries a large fraction of hearing loss is genetic and non-syndromic, i.e. not associated with other phenotypes.  During the prior granting period, we implemented and integrated comprehensive genetic testing as a cornerstone in the evaluation of the deaf and hard-of-hearing person. The American College of Medical Genetics has recognized the merit of this approach, and in 2014 included comprehensive genetic testing for the evaluation of deafness in their newest treatment guidelines. In the largest study to date to corroborate this decision, we found an underlying genetic cause for hearing loss in 440 (39%) of 1119 sequentially accrued patients chosen without exclusion criteria. Pathogenic variants were present in 49 genes and included missense variants (49%), copy number changes (18%), indels (18%), nonsense variants (8%), splice-site alterations (6%) and promoter variants (<1%), making comprehensive genetic testing the single best test to order in the diagnosis of hearing loss after an audiogram.  In this competitive renewal, we will build on these accomplishments by completing the following aims: • Specific Aim 1: To optimize phenotype-genotype integration in the analysis of hereditary hearing loss  by refining the use of hierarchical surface clustering and audioprofile surface analysis to determine  which types of genetic hearing loss are associated with clinically meaningful sub-clusters • Specific Aim 2: To validate and integrate physics-based protein modeling as a tool within the Deafness  Variation Database to predict variant effect and the molecular and patient phenotype • Specific Aim 3: To identify genetic modifiers of specific deafness-causing genes predicted by  hierarchical surface clustering and validated by physics-based potential free-energy modeling  The successful completion of this grant will improve the clinical care of persons with hearing loss by enhancing phenome-genome integration and by making variant interpretation more robust. Knowledge gained from this proposal will also lay the foundation for refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex phenotypes such as noise- induced and age-related hearing loss. This competitive renewal addresses the increasingly daunting challenge of variant interpretation. We will seamlessly integrate AudioGene into the OtoSCOPE® pipeline, explore hierarchical surfaces clustering at all loci, enhance the utility of the Deafness Variation Database by adding physics-based potential free-energy modeling, and using these tools, identify genetic modifiers of select types of genetic hearing loss. The completion of these aims will lay the foundation for more refined studies focused on the identification of genetic modifiers – both positive and negative – associated with complex hearing loss phenotypes including noise-induced and age-related hearing loss.",Optimizing Genetic Testing for Deafness for Clinical Diagnostics,10058828,R01DC012049,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Auditory Threshold', 'Biology', 'Case Study', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Duchenne muscular dystrophy', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Foundations', 'Free Energy', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hearing', 'Hearing Tests', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Newborn Infant', 'Noise', 'Octogenarian', 'Otoscopes', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Presbycusis', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical trial implementation', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'deaf', 'deafness', 'design', 'evaluation/testing', 'falls', 'gene therapy', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic testing', 'hard of hearing', 'hearing impairment', 'hearing loss phenotype', 'hearing preservation', 'hereditary hearing loss', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phenome', 'precision genetics', 'prognostic', 'promoter', 'research clinical testing', 'software systems', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,508845
"Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX SUMMARY Deficiencies in coagulation factor IX (FIX) cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, while high levels of FIX pose a risk for thrombosis. Thus, genetic variation in the F9 gene encoding FIX can impact bleeding by decreasing FIX expression or activity, or can impact thrombosis by increasing FIX expression or activity. However, when a new DNA variant is discovered in the F9 gene, we typically lack the evidence needed to confidently determine if the variant alters the function of the encoded FIX protein and, if so, how severely. For example, in the national hemophilia genotyping project MyLifeOurFuture, the majority of F9 missense variants (i.e. DNA changes predicted to change a FIX amino acid) discovered in patients with hemophilia B had insufficient evidence to be classified as pathogenic. Functional studies, where a FIX variant’s stability, activity or other properties are evaluated in vitro, can provide strong evidence to inform interpretation of F9 variants. However, traditional functional studies are time- and resource-intensive, so testing the hundreds of F9 variant we have observed so far would be impractical. Evaluating the thousands of possible FIX missense variants we could observe as more individuals are sequenced would be impossible. Instead, we propose a new approach to express and characterize nearly every possible missense variant in the FIX protein to advance our understanding of FIX biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the F9 gene, and advance hemophilia care and treatments. To accomplish this goal, we will employ deep mutational scanning, a method we developed for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. Here, we will display a library of nearly all possible FIX missense variants tethered to the surface of cultured human cells. We propose to exploit this FIX surface display library in two aims: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on FIX expression and secretion, and 2) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible F9 missense variant on specific FIX functions including Gla-domain gamma-carboxylation and activation of FIX by factor XIa (FXIa). These aims will reveal how nearly all possible missense variants in FIX impact expression, secretion, gamma- carboxylation, and activation by FXIa. In aim 3, we will use these large-scale functional data to dissect the mechanism by which F9 pathogenic variants disrupt FIX function. We will also use machine learning, leveraging the functional data along with other features to predict pathogenicity for each missense variant in FIX. Taken together, the functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of F9 variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand FIX biology, improve the clinical translation of F9 genetic information, and inform new treatments. NARRATIVE DNA changes that affect the F9 gene that makes coagulation factor IX (FIX) can reduce FIX levels and cause the bleeding disorder hemophilia B, or increase the amount of active FIX and increase the risk of thrombosis. Although hundreds of variants have been detected in the F9 gene, there is often insufficient information to know how any one specific change will affect the protein, if that change will cause disease, or how severe disease will likely be. We will use new technologies to study the consequences of every possible amino acide change in FIX, with the goal of developing the information needed to understand the significance of new genetic changes as they are discovered in the future and to improve the care and treatment of patients.",Comprehensive Characterization of Missense Mutants in Factor IX,10136082,R01HL152066,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Caring', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Clinic', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comprehension', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'F9 gene', 'Factor Analysis', 'Factor IX', 'Factor XIa', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Future', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hemophilia A', 'Hemophilia B', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'carboxylation', 'clinical translation', 'experimental study', 'gain of function', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'mutant', 'mutation screening', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'tool']",NHLBI,BLOODWORKS,R01,2021,428767
"The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms Project Summary  Recent years have witnessed the development of large research projects that involve  genotyping hundreds of thousands of individuals, on which we have available detailed medical records. Examples include the All of us research project, the Million Veteran Program, and the UKBiobank resource. Often, whole-genome sequencing data is also available for a substantial fraction of the individuals. These large samples, with their precise genotypic and phenotypic information, give us the opportunity to bring our understanding of the relations between genetic variation and traits of medical interest to the next level.  While the initial small sample sizes available for genome wide association studies (GWAS) motivated analyses that were approximative in nature, we are now in the position to probe more closely the genetic causal mechanisms underlying medically relevant phenotypes. We can aspire to distinguish variants that have causal effects from those that are associated because of linkage disequilibrium or population structure. Indeed, we need to pay even greater attention to the implications of hidden confounders: even small effects become significant when sample sizes are large enough.  Increasing the resolution with which we can describe causal mechanisms will result in the identification of clearer targets for drug development. It will also improve the precision of  personalized risk evaluations based on genotypes: if we can construct risk scores using variants that are truly causal, their performance will remain solid across ethnicities and environmental exposures.  To zoom in on genetic variants with causal effects, this project will leverage a set of new statistical methodologies that the investigators have recently introduced. These new approaches are remarkably flexible, in that they do not rely on specific assumptions of how phenotypes are linked to genetic variants. Indeed, they allow researchers to capitalize on powerful machine learning algorithms and, crucially, equip their results with precise replicability guarantees.  We have assembled a diverse and complementary team, including experts in statistical  genomics, methodological statistics and computer science, with a strong record both of software development and genetic data analysis. A postdoctoral scholar and two graduate students will contribute to the research program, and the interdisciplinary training they will acquire in  statistics, computation and genetics will add another substantial benefit. Personalized medicine strives to provide treatments that are fine-tuned to the patients, aware both of the specificity of their diseases as well as of the individuals’ background characteristics. In order to achieve this promise, identifying those genes and mutations that influence the medically relevant traits is an important tool: it gives us the opportunity to understand the biological pathways involved, inspires drug development, informs treatment and counseling and facilitates prevention. The proposed research would develop new methods of statistical analysis to harness the information contained in large datasets, increasing our ability to distinguish the genetic mutations that directly impact phenotypes, from those that are merely correlated with traits of interest.",The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms,10291186,R56HG010812,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computer science', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'polygenic risk score', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,455280
"Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease Project Summary/Abstract Understanding and treating genome abnormalities that lead to rare genetic neurodegenerative diseases such as Niemann-Pick C1 globally managing cholesterol homeostasis, or APOE alleles impacting cholesterol homeostasis in the brain triggering late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), present a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We have developed a Gaussian process regression (GPR) based machine learning (ML) approach that captures for the first time genomic variation in the population to understand the spatial covariance (SCV) relationships contributing to sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual. Genetic disease is fundamentally a problem of understanding the impact of altered folding intermediates found in response to variation in the protein fold and how they are managed by proteostasis. Proteostasis encompasses a broad range of chaperone and degradative components that manage the synthesis, folding/stability and function of the protein fold in response to inherited and environmental stress and aging. The general premise of this proposal is to develop a deep genome-based understanding of proteostasis that will teach us how to manage genetic diseases triggered by folding stress. The rationale for this proposal is that sparse genetic diversity found in the population, when used as a collective through application of GRP-ML defined SCV relationships, can provide us on a residue-by-residue basis insight into the folding intermediates that contribute to disease for the entire polypeptide sequence. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of proteostasis in managing this genetic diversity for the benefit of therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that management of the polypeptide fold of disease-causing variant proteins found in the population by targeting the function of the multivalent Hsp40 and Hsp70 co-chaperone/chaperone branch (the Hsp70 axis) of the proteostasis network will enable precision correction of misfolding phenotypes found in neurodegenerative disease. Our approach will study the impact of variation in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene. NPC1 is an inherited, autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomal (LE) and lysosome (Ly) compartments of all cell types. The primary effect of NPC1 variation results in early onset neurodegenerative disease in response to loss of cholesterol homeostasis. In Aim 1 we will explore the ability of small molecules to allosterically regulate the activity of components of the Hsp70 axis to retune the synthesis, folding/stability, trafficking and/or function of NPC1 variants. In Aim 2 we will explore the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of the Hsp70 axis components that are responsible for enabling NPC1 variant correction. Completion of both aims will generate a comprehensive assessment of the role of Hsp70 axis in NPC1 disease progression and will be used as a guide for advancement of a precision medicine approach to reduce or prevent the onset of neurodegenerative disease triggered by genomic variation in NPC1 population. Project Narrative Understanding the mechanism behind and treatment of genome abnormalities in the population that cause rare genetic disease in the individual represents a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We will study the impact of genetic variation found in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene, that, like APOE alleles driving late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), is responsible for management of cholesterol homeostasis. We will use Gaussian process regression machine learning (GPR-ML) based spatial covariance (SCV) tools to define the mechanism of action of proteostasis components found in the Hsp70 axis to therapeutically manage the NPC1 fold leading to improved to cholesterol homeostasis in the individual to provide basic and clinical insight into disease management.",Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease,10100560,R01AG070209,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Cholesterol Homeostasis', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'GRP gene', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heat-Shock Proteins 70', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Action', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Niemann-Pick Diseases', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Ubiquitin', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'biochemical tools', 'biophysical tools', 'cell type', 'cholesterol control', 'druggable target', 'early onset', 'fitness', 'genomic variation', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'polypeptide', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein misfolding', 'proteostasis', 'rare genetic disorder', 'rare variant', 'response', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,443750
"Integrative genomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer using long read sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY The last twenty years have experienced extensive growth in the sequencing of cancer genomes, leading to a dramatically increased understanding of the role of genetic and epigenetic mutations in cancer. This has largely been enabled by developments in high-throughput “second-generation” sequencing technology and analysis that characterize cancer genomes using short-reads. Recently, a new generation of high-throughput long-read sequencing instruments, primarily from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, have become available that are poised to displace short-read sequencing for many applications. We and others have used these technologies to discover tens of thousands of variants per cancer genome that are not detectable using short-reads, including structural variants and differentially methylated regions in known oncogenes and cancer risk genes. These technologies carry the potential to address many open questions in cancer biology, however, the analysis of long-read sequencing data is computationally demanding and needs specialized algorithms that are either too inefficient to use at scale or do not yet exist. In this proposal, we will address several gaps in the application of long-read technology for basic research and clinical use in cancer genomics. First, we will develop improved methods for finding structural variants and complex repeat expansions from long-reads, both of which are major diagnostic and prognostic indicators of disease, yet are not accurately identified using existing methods. Leveraging the improved phasing capabilities of long reads, this work will include the detection of mosaic variants, revealing tumor heterogeneity and variants in precancerous tissues. Next, we will apply machine learning and systems level advances to accelerate and improve the comparison of variants across large patient cohorts. Critically, this will compensate for the error prone nature of single molecule long-read sequencing to make these comparisons more accurate when comparing tumor-normal samples or pedigrees of related patients so that recurrent driving mutations can be accurately identified. Finally, we will develop integrative methods for the joint analysis of genome, transcriptome, and epigenetic profiling of cancer genomes. These advances will improve the identification of fusion genes, and allow for entirely new forms of epigenetic analysis, such as the allele-specific analysis of methylation across transposable elements and other repetitive elements. Synthesizing the many thousands of novel variants we will detect using our methods, we will then develop algorithms that will identify and evaluate recurrent genetic or epigenetic variations as putative driving mutations. All methods will be released open-source and will empower us, our ITCR collaborators, and the cancer genomics community at large to study genetic and epigenetic variants with near perfect accuracy and thereby unlock many new associations to treatment and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Emerging long-read single molecule sequencing platforms are poised to establish a new level of quality and resolution in cancer genome sequencing. Here we will develop and enhance algorithms for several important tasks in genomics with long reads, including improved genetic variation detection, transcriptional profiling, and methylation analysis. We will then work with our collaborators and other researchers to deploy these methods to develop a more complete understanding of cancer progression.",Integrative genomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer using long read sequencing,10187808,U01CA253481,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancerous', 'Cataloging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Karyotype', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'driver mutation', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'fusion gene', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'power analysis', 'premalignant', 'risk variant', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,383463
"Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks Abstract Accurately detecting structural variation in the genome is a challenging task. Many approaches have been developed over the last few decades, yet it is estimated that tens of thousands of variants are still being missed in a given sample. Many of these variants are missed due to the limitations of using short-read sequencing to identify large variants. Although many of these missed variants are located within complex regions of the genome, it has been shown that some still have clinical relevance making their discovery important. New platforms have been developed for sequencing the genome using long-reads and show promise for overcoming many of these limitations creating the ability to identify the full spectrum of simple and complex structural variants. Because this technology is relatively young, new computational approaches to support the analysis of long-read sequencing data can aid in the discovery of these variants which are still being missed. In addition to detecting novel variation in samples with long-read sequencing data, computational approaches can be developed to leverage these novel variant calls to reanalyze the hundreds of thousands of short-read datasets currently available. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational approaches to identify novel structural variation in the genome. In Aim 1, we will apply a recurrence approach to analyze long read sequencing datasets utilizing deep neural networks. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool to derive profiles of structural variants predicted in long- reads which can be used to identify and genotype structural variants calls in short read data-sets. Together, these approaches will allow researchers to accurately characterize structural variation in both long and short- read datasets. Narrative Structural variation has been implicated in numerous human diseases but there are still tens of thousands of variants being overlooked in the genome. The proposed research aims to detect novel variation by developing new computational tools to analyze data generated by state-of-the-art sequencing methods. These tools will aid in the discovery of variants associated with human health.",Discovering Novel Structural Genomic Rearrangements Using Deep Neural Networks,10128484,F31HG010569,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Sciences', 'Categories', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Label', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Computations', 'Pattern', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'detection method', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'reference genome', 'structural genomics', 'tool', 'variant detection']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2021,38173
"Identifying new drivers of ovarian cancer from the non-coding genome by converging germline risk variants and somatic mutations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research training program is to provide tailored additional training to facilitate successful career development throughout the completion of postdoctoral fellowship and the transition to independent tenure track professor. The key elements of this plan are: Candidate: I have considerable research experience in developing and applying computational models to understand complex biological systems. The training component of this proposal will focus on acquisition of knowledge in cancer genetics and genomics, integrative computational methodologies, and next-generation sequencing technologies. Additionally, I will receive training in laboratory management, networking and collaborations, and grant submissions. This well-rounded training plan will accelerate my goals of being an independent researcher and developing computational models to better understand cancer biology. Environment: The training environment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center fosters productivity and collaboration with world class researchers in clinical and basic biomedical science. I have assembled an advisory committee with esteemed experts in the areas of epigenomics, genetics, data science and cancer biology to ensure my success in this training program and to guide me through the successful acquisition of a tenure track faculty position. These include my mentor Dr. Simon Gayther and four advisors, Dr. Benjamin Berman and Dr. Shelly Lu from Cedars-Sinai, and Dr. Bogdan Pasaniuc, and Dr. Paul Boutros from University of California, Los Angeles. Research: A fundamental goal of human genetics is to decipher the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Cancer is a disease comprising a heritable component that confers cancer predisposition and an acquired (somatic) component where accumulation of genetic alterations occurs during disease development. Population based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses have identified thousands of germline risk variants and somatic non-coding mutations involved in ovarian cancer development. Often, protein-coding cancer driver genes harbor both deleterious germline risk variants and somatic mutations. This proposal hypothesizes that the same is true for non-coding cancer drivers. With the wealth of epigenomics and regulatory datasets, the goal is to identify genomic regions where there are interactions between germline and somatic variants. The specific aims are: (1) identify functional regulatory elements where non-coding germline and somatic ovarian cancer variants co-localize; (2) identify non-coding ovarian cancer drivers through multi-omics regulatory evidence by machine learning models. The proposed studies will establish systematic and quantitative models to identify ovarian cancer non-coding drivers and improve our understanding of disease etiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ovarian cancer is responsible for more than 150,000 deaths per year and so it remains a high priority to develop effective prevention approaches and to identify new disease specific therapies to reduce disease mortality. The research proposed here has two components: (1) To characterize the genetic component in ovarian cancer development through epigenomic landscape; (2) to establish the functional relevance of genetic findings for clinical translation. This is a highly integrated multi-disciplinary research proposal, and these approaches to novel discovery and mechanistic understanding are desperately needed to advance our basic knowledge of this disease to develop clinical interventions that reduce mortality.",Identifying new drivers of ovarian cancer from the non-coding genome by converging germline risk variants and somatic mutations,10115485,K99CA256519,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Area', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Buffers', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epithelial ovarian cancer', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Human Genetics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Ovarian', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention approach', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer predisposition', 'cancer type', 'career development', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'ovarian neoplasm', 'population based', 'precursor cell', 'professor', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'success', 'tenure track', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,173048
"Single cell atlas as a roadmap for interpreting human genetic variation in complex disease Project Summary Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci likely affecting human health. To translate these findings into therapeutic targets and disease treatments, we need to understand the cellular context and underlying biological mechanisms through which each disease associated variant disrupts function. Large scale, information rich datasets are being generated across multiple modalities including transcriptomics from single cell RNA-seq studies, traits and phenotypes from the UK Biobank and germline genetic variation from exome sequencing studies. Here, we propose to develop methods to integrate these amazing resources towards understanding the identifying biological and cellular mechanisms that are leading to disease. The objectives will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) Integrate population scale biological datasets including UK Biobank and single cell transcriptomics data to construct gene modules with the goal to recapitulate biological pathways. 2) Develop a statistical framework to measure mutational burden across each of the cell type specific gene modules. Together, this research proposal will increase the power in interpreting human genetic variation and help better understand the mechanism through which they act. These methods are being developed around an IBD dataset and will derive substantial molecular information about the mechanisms driving IBD. The lessons and methodological advances from this work will be directly applicable in many complex disease contexts. Project Narrative Genome wide association studies are highly successful identifying thousands of disease-associated loci but fall short at 1) pinpointing the biological mechanisms through which the variants effect disease and 2) capturing the effects of rare variants which may be having larger effect on disease outcomes. This research proposal details plans to integrate high-throughput single cell transcriptomics, population scale biobank datasets and exome sequencing from large disease cohorts to learn a prior on which genes are likely working together in which cell types and consequently improve the statistical power in interpreting rare human genetic variation.

"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",10101662,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,564082
"Tools for Normalizing and Interpreting the Clinical Actionability of Genomic Variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The availability of high-throughput, low-cost sequencing has transformed the landscape of biomedical research by dramatically expanding our capacity to interrogate the sequence of the human genome. Consequently, there has been an explosion of biomedical literature describing the role of specific genomic variants and their impact on human diseases. These advances are bringing sequencing into the clinic to shape clinical practice from the patient’s genomic content, a paradigm colloquially referred to as genomic or precision medicine. There remain many obstacles to fully realizing our potential in the era of precision medicine. Among them is a recognized need for robust, well-engineered systems that provide knowledge about genomic variants and their role in disease. Ideally, such systems would provide a comprehensive summary of all knowledge that is relevant to the patient’s unique genomic content. An early bottleneck to realizing precision medicine was that, despite the substantial literature and several established knowledgebases that define interactions between drugs and genes, querying across them was extremely challenging. In response to this need, the Drug-Gene Interaction database (DGIdb, dgidb.org) was developed. Through a combination of automated processing and manual curation, drug-gene interaction information was collected, structured, and connected (normalized) from these diverse sources of data and entered into a database with a user-friendly search interface and an application programming interface (API). However, linking drug and drug-gene interaction concepts across resources remains an extremely challenging task, and aggregated drug-gene interactions are also challenging to represent in a way that highlights the utility of the collected knowledge for precision medicine efforts. This proposal seeks to improve our ability to normalize and interpret drug-gene interactions corresponding to patient genomic variants. We will achieve this goal through two specific aims. First, the DGIdb normalization routines will be improved through incorporation of new content and features. Among these, the DGIdb will support collections of drugs, including combination therapies and drug classes. Also, the DGIdb will have new community submission and curation features, allowing users to incorporate new knowledge into the database. Second, the Variant Interpretation Aggregator database (VIAdb) will be created to normalize knowledge across several disparate sources focused on the clinical interpretations of genomic variants. The VIAdb will operate as a stand-alone web tool and API and will behave as a source of relevant interpretations to DGIdb. Finally, we will develop techniques for automated identification of drug-gene interactions and variant interpretation consensus to assist community curation efforts. If successful, this research will improve breadth and consistency of variant interpretations and drug-gene interactions for precision medicine efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will improve our ability to interpret genomic variations in human patients in support of precision medicine efforts. Specifically, it will provide web-based tools for identifying potential therapies that specifically target the patient’s individual genes or variants, and an assessment of the clinical actionability of those drugs.",Tools for Normalizing and Interpreting the Clinical Actionability of Genomic Variants,10415312,R00HG010157,"['Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Level of Evidence', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'The Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center at the Vanderbilt University', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'cancer type', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug resource', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genomic variation', 'human disease', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'response', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'web app', 'web interface', 'web-based tool']",NHGRI,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R00,2021,249000
"Massively-parallel functional interrogation of genetic variation in LGMD-associated sarcoglycan genes PROJECT SUMMARY Mutations in α-, β-, γ-, and δ-sarcoglycan cause sarcoglyanopathies, a subset of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) with devastating effects for patients including muscle wasting, progressive weakness, degeneration of skeletal muscle and often premature death. Accurately diagnosing patients with LGMD before symptom onset or early in the course of the disease has the potential to enable the use of preventative gene therapy or other therapeutics and in the majority of cases can only be done in presymptomatic cases through genetic testing. When a new DNA variant in one of these genes is observed in a patient, however, there is often insufficient evidence to classify it as pathogenic. Within this study, we will use a new approach to express and characterize every possible missense variant in the SGCA, SGCB, SGCG and SGCD genes to advance our understanding of sarcoglycan biology, improve the interpretation of genetic variation in the SGC genes, and advance LGMD care and treatments. We will employ deep mutational scanning, a method for measuring the effects of massive numbers of missense variants of a protein simultaneously. We will express a library of all possible SGC missense variants in cultured human cells and measure the effect of each by exploiting a simple but robust characteristic of pathogenic SGC gene variants, disruption of proper protein trafficking. Our two aims are: 1) Quantifying the effect of nearly every possible SGC missense variant on SGC protein trafficking and membrane localization, and 2) Predict and validate the pathogenicity of every possible SGC missense variant by integrating multiple functional assays from Aim 1 to create a pathogenicity score for each variant and by confirming variant predictions biochemically using tissue samples from LGMD patients with VUS. These aims will reveal how each possible missense variant in SGC genes impact expression, transport, function or interaction with other SGC proteins. The functional data we generate, the analyses we propose, and tools we build will transform the characterization of SGC variants. They will also serve as a resource to better understand sarcoglycan biology, improve the clinical translation of sarcoglycanopathies and LGMD using genetic information, and inform new treatments. The goal of this project is to develop a method to reliably predict the consequences of genetic variants of unknown significance discovered in the course of genetic testing in a subset of Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies caused by mutations in the sarcoglycan genes SGCA, SGCB, SGCD and SGCG. We propose to use an integrated experimental and computational approach that combines multiple high-throughput assays of protein trafficking and function and machine-learning to generate pathogenicity predictions for all possible single- nucleotide variants in these SGC genes and then to validate our predictions in primary tissue samples from patients with SGC variants.",Massively-parallel functional interrogation of genetic variation in LGMD-associated sarcoglycan genes,10193457,R21AR078942,"['Archives', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fostering', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'International', 'Libraries', 'Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Muscle', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Registries', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sarcoglycans', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Soluble Guanylate Cyclase', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'biomedical referral center', 'clinical translation', 'delta Sarcoglycan', 'gamma Sarcoglycan', 'gene function', 'gene therapy', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'mutation screening', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'premature', 'protein function', 'protein transport', 'tool', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIAMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,207900
"Enhancing molecular diagnosis in children with multiple congenital anomalies using clinically focused splicing prediction algorithms The training included in this career development award promotes the applicant's development as a physician-scientist during his the PhD phase of his MD/PhD training in transdisciplinary computational genomics. The applicant has previously completed a Master's Degree in Mathematics, and has had extensive instruction in general computational biology. This unique melding of high-level computational expertise and interest in applied genomics has led to the development of this innovative project. He is now being co-mentored by Drs. Barash and Bhoj to gain complementary practical training in predictive algorithm development and molecular genetics. In both his clinical and research interests he is dedicated to improving the rate of molecular diagnosis for children with rare Mendelian disorders. His short-term goals include developing and refining his skills in RNA splicing prediction and human genetic variation analysis in exome and genome data. In addition, he will gain new insight into experimental design, data interpretation, and scientific communication skills to ensure his successful post-doctoral transition. His co-mentors for the proposal are Drs. Yoseph Barash and Elizabeth Bhoj, international leaders in computational genomics and molecular genetics. In addition he will be supported by outstanding resources of the MSTP at Penn, which has an extensive proven track record of successful previous awardees.  The applicant has been pursuing work in creating an improved computational pipeline for the analysis of variants from exome and genome data. Specifically he is capturing the intronic and synonymous variants that are generally removed from the analysis pipeline because of the difficulty in determining the pathogenicity of such variants. As there are many intronic and synonymous variants that are known to cause Mendelain disorders, this clearly leads to missed diagnoses. In Aim 1 he will generate an interpretable algorithm for prioritizing general splicing variants that guides functional validation. In Aim 2 he will identify novel variants and genes for mechanistic evaluation in the pathogenesis of congenital anomalies. This algorithm will be generally applicable, significantly enhancing our ability to provide molecular diagnoses for all patients with suspected Mendelian disorders. In addition, this proposal will allow the candidate to gain experience, knowledge, and new skills to successfully lay the foundation as a physician-scientist in computational genomics. Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause.

"Genetics of oxycodone intake in a hybrid rat diversity panel. The steady rise in prescription opioids such as oxycodone has led to widespread abuse and deaths in the US. importance of drug pharmacokinetics in determining abuse potential, we have designed an oral operant rat self-administration (SA) procedure to model the pattern of drug intake of most human users/abusers of oxycodone, who initiate using oral tablets. Although genetic variants play important roles in susceptibility to opioid addiction, very limited data are available regarding specific genes and sequence variants that predispose to opioid addiction, and under what conditions. Given the We propose to use an innovative hybrid rat diversity panel (HRDP), which consists of 91 diverse rat genomes, to identify genetic variants influencing operant oxycodone intake in rats. The HRDP is unique in that it: 1) contains a high level of genetic diversity similar to that of human populations; 2) provides a way to control oxycodone exposure and to systematically study gene-by-environment and gene-by-drug interactions; and 3) integrates multi-omics ""addictome"" data: from genetics to epigenomics to brain connectomes to treatments. We have three aims: Aim 1: We will analyze whole genome sequencing data to define virtually all sequence variants that underlie heritable variations. De novo assemblies will be conducted using linked-reads data for selected high impact strains. Hi-C data (Dovetail Genomics) will be generated to further improve the quality of these assemblies. We will also generate RNA-seq data for key brain regions to obtain mechanistic insights into oxycodone intake. Aim 2: Using the HRDP (both sexes), we will phenotype oral oxycodone SA with a unique behavioral model. Rats will also be tested for sensitivity to pain, social behaviors, and anxiety-like traits - all signs of oxycodone withdrawal. Critically, we estimated the heritability (h2) of oxycodone intake in the range of 0.3 – 0.4. When using n=6/sex, the effective h2 is ~0.8 —sufficient for high precision mapping. Aim 3: We will use systems genetics methods to map and integrate behavioral phenotypes with sequence and transcriptome data. Both forward (QTL) and reverse (PheWAS) genetic methods will be used. We use new linear mixed models to map and test candidate genes with key cofactors using the GeneNetwork2 platform. Finally, we evaluate the translational relevance of candidate genes and biomarkers by comparison to GWAS cohorts and longitudinal reports of addiction in humans. Technical and conceptual advances that underlie this application are: new genomic methods combined with highly diverse rat populations allow us to quickly define novel gene variants that modulate key phases of opiate addiction. It is highly likely that a subset of variants and molecular networks we define will provide key components of a predictive framework linking sequence differences to human opioid addiction and potential treatments. This project uses new systems genetics approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake. The U.S. has declared a national public health emergency to combat the current opioid crisis that is causing over 30,000 deaths per year. This project uses new systems genetics approaches, open source genomic data and software, and a new type of hybrid rodent mapping panel to precisely define causal linkages between DNA variation and voluntary oxycodone intake.

"Large scale genome sequencing and integrative analyses to define genomic predictors of recurrent pregnancy loss SUMMARY: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) occurs in approximately 5% of clinically recognized pregnancy losses. The etiology of RPL is not well characterized: after excluding the known etiologies, approximately half of women with RPL still have no identifiable cause. The fact that RPL is, in fact, recurrent suggests a strong genetic component, however there is currently a very limited understanding of the genomic contributions to RPL. Previous studies are typically deficient in their design, limited by small sample size, incomplete clinical phenotyping and/or the recruitment of singletons only. In this proposal, we put forward our plan to recruit 1000 rigorously-phenotyped RPL trios including from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds across the US and to apply WGS and sophisticated variant detection and interpretation methods developed by our labs to identify pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for RPL. We will then perform comprehensive integrative data analyses to define the genetic basis of unexplained RPL and map the genes and regions of the chromosome that are absolutely required for human development and a successful pregnancy. Our variant interpretation pipeline includes cutting edge approaches to map likely pathogenic noncoding and structural variants rarely assessed in any pregnancy loss study. We will also perform a pilot RNA-seq study to assess the utility of this approach for gene discovery in the pregnancy loss setting. We will first look for recessive pathogenic variation, including compound heterozygosity and then test for models for de novo mosaicism, mitochondrial mutations, regulatory noncoding variation and overall mutational burden. From these combined analyses, we expect to uncover many variants in genes and regions of the chromosome that are intolerable to functional variation, which we define as the human intolerome. We will build on our previous studies to map the intolerome by combining i) available data from all clinical studies to define the genetic etiology of unexplained pregnancy loss, including data generated in this proposal and in our prior work, ii) network-based approaches to prioritize variants genes important for human development and pregnancy, iii) mouse (KOMP, DMDD/MGI) and cell line knockout studies iv) rare and common disease sequencing studies including Centers for Mendelian Genomics (CMG), Center for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) and Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC), iv) emerging human pangenome studies HPP, and v) population-scale biobank projects such as UK BioBank and All of Us. We will then confirm these predictions via collaborator-led functional studies and retrospective analyses of RPL first losses, siblings and grandparents. The sharing of early, unpublished data from the Yale CMG and HPP enabled by our leadership in these projects is a significant strength of what will be by far the largest and most comprehensive study of RPL performed to date. Our findings will take great strides towards the goal of comprehensively mapping the human intolerome and will further expand and refine the exploratory space in which to investigate the genes and chromosomal regions essential for human development.

"Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis Project Summary/Abstract In the United States, the joint disease osteoarthritis (OA) debilitates over one-third of people over sixty-five years old and causes hundreds of thousands of knee replacements annually. Despite its high prevalence, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate knee formation and OA risk and how one inherits risk at specific joints (e.g., knee versus hip). Recent GWAS have identified at least seventeen loci that significantly associate with knee OA risk. However, the casual variants for these loci have not been identified because their association signals span large genomic intervals harboring uninvestigated non-coding regulatory regions. Of these, common variants in the Growth Differentiation Factor Five gene (GDF5), a critical regulator of joint development, reproducibly associate with knee OA risk in human populations. GDF5 OA variants reside on a high frequency 130 kb haplotype possessing numerous mutations that each may be causal for OA risk, but interestingly, no protein coding mutations have been uncovered that explain the associations. In a complementary study, we discovered ten GDF5 regulatory elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers) spanning this interval and revealed that they function with tremendous joint specificity (e.g., knee vs. hip). These enhancers were initially tested at incipient stages of GDF5 expression in mouse embryos, but we also know that GDF5 contributes to the differentiation of knee structures (ligaments, tendons, menisci, articular surfaces) well after this stage of development. Our research will bring together knee OA risk variants in patient populations and our knowledge of how GDF5 is controlled at the DNA level. We first aim to assess the functional contributions of joint-specific GDF5 enhancers to pre-natal knee development and adult joint homeostasis using CRISPR-Cas9 editing to excise these elements in vitro in human cells and in vivo in the mouse. Strikingly, our pilot analyses also revealed that a subset of these GDF5 enhancers possesses common and rare human variants in strong linkage disequilibrium with the highest associated OA variants in the interval. Our second aim is to further explore the association between genetic variants in the locus and OA knee shape using data acquired from the complete Osteoarthritis Initiative MR database on adult knees. Our preliminary data reveal that several variants associated with OA knee shape reside in several functional enhancers that control expression of GDF5 in the knee. Finally, our third aim is to functionally test these human regulatory variants for their impact on enhancer activity, knee formation, and OA risk by using transfection studies and CRISPR-Cas9 in human cartilage cells and in the mouse model. Completion of these studies will reveal functional variants in GDF5 that underlie its role in knee shape and OA risk. Project Narrative The Growth Differentiation Factor Five (GDF5) gene is the most reproducibly detected gene region in candidate and genome-wide association studies focusing on knee osteoarthritis risk. The proposed research focuses on (1) assessing the specific functions of key GDF5 regulatory sequences in knee development and cartilage maintenance in mice and humans, (2) the association of genetic variants in GDF5 locus with osteoarthritis knee shape, and (3) the impacts that human GDF5 risk mutations have on chondrocyte and joint biology.",Uncovering the Genetic Mechanisms Behind Joint-Specific Osteoarthritis,10179320,R01AR070139,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Chondrocytes', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Differentiation and Growth', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Enhancers', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Haplotypes', 'High Prevalence', 'Hip region structure', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Ligaments', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Veins', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'cartilage cell', 'causal variant', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'in vitro activity', 'in vivo', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prenatal', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'spatiotemporal', 'whole genome']",NIAMS,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,612601
"lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data PROJECT SUMMARY The onset of most human disease involves numerous molecular-level changes to the complex system of interacting genes and pathways that function differently in specific cell-lineage, pathway, and treatment contexts. This system is probed by thousands of functional genomics and quantitative genetic studies, and integrative analysis of these data can generate testable hypotheses identifying causal genetic variants and linking them to network level changes in cells to disease phenotypes. This can enable deeper molecular-level understanding of pathophysiology, paving the way to genome-based precision medicine.  The long term goal of this project is to enable such discoveries through integrative analysis of high- throughput biological data in a disease context. In the previous funding periods, we developed accurate data integration methods, created algorithms for the prediction of disease genes through context-specific and mechanistic network models and analysis of quantitative genetics data, and made novel insights into important biological processes and diseases. We further enabled experimental biological discovery by building public interactive systems capable of real-time user-driven integration that are popular among experimental biologists.  We now propose to connect these gene-level functional network approaches with the underlying genomic variation by deciphering how genomic variants lead to specific transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. We propose to develop ab initio sequence-level models capable of predicting biochemical effects of any genomic variant (including rare or never observed) on chromatin state and RNA regulation, then link these effects with gene-level regulatory consequences (including tissue-specific transcription and RNA splicing), and finally put genomic sequence directly into the network context via a statistical approach for detecting genes and network neighborhoods with a significantly elevated mutational burden in disease. Our key deliverable will be a user- friendly, interactive web-based framework enabling systems-level variant impact analysis in a network context and an open source library for computational scientists. In addition to systematic analysis across contexts and diseases, we will collaborate with experimentalists to apply our methods to Alzheimer’s, autism spectrum disorders, chronic kidney disease, immune diseases, and congenital heart defects as case studies for the iterative improvement of our methods and to directly contribute to better understanding of these diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE To pave the way for mechanistic interpretation of disease in the genomic context and eventually, precision medicine, we will develop algorithms for de novo prediction of functional biochemical effects of noncoding variants at the DNA regulation and RNA processing levels and then build frameworks for sequence-based prediction of tissue-specific transcription and post-transcriptional RNA processes (starting with splicing). To facilitate discovery of disease mechanisms, we will develop approaches for analyzing these variant effects in a network context, including those developed in the previous grant period (mechanistic and functional networks) and novel network models that integrate exon usage information or enhancer-gene interactions. In addition to verifying top predictions experimentally in our group or by our collaborators in case study areas of neurodegenerative disease, chronic kidney disease, ASD, and congenital heart disease, we will make our methods available to the broader biomedical community through public, interactive user interfaces and open source libraries.",lntegration and Visualization of Diverse Biological Data,10192732,R01GM071966,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Case Study', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Histones', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunology', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'causal variant', 'cell type', 'congenital heart disorder', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'transcription factor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,448294
"Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development Project Summary A deep understanding of gene regulation and function during craniofacial development is not only important for our biological knowledge, but also critical to identify causal variants and genes underlying many dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases. Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and DOC diseases. These datasets are highly heterogeneous (e.g. platforms, species, tissues, developmental stages) and cross-species (e.g. human and mouse), requiring novel analytical approaches for decoding genetic regulation, molecular function, and cellular maps in craniofacial development. Critically, because of practical unavailability of human embryonic craniofacial tissue, there is a big gap between the abundant -omics and functional studies in murine craniofacial development and large-scale human genetic studies of DOC diseases. In this proposal, we combine machine learning, genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), complex disease genetics, developmental biology to design novel methods aiming to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development. We propose three specific aims. Aim 1. To develop a deep learning method, DeepFace, for characterizing and prioritizing genetic variants and regulation during craniofacial development. DeepFace is designed to decipher functional impact of noncoding variants and will be the first deep learning method to integrate cross-species functional features in craniofacial development. We will validate DeepFace by using data from genome-wide association studies (15 datasets) and case-parent trio-based whole genome sequencing (3 datasets) of orofacial clefts (OFCs). This validation will identify potential causal variants, both common and de novo mutations, in OFCs. Aim 2. To develop deep learning methods for time-series scRNA-seq data analysis in craniofacial development. We will develop novel algorithms including TTNNet for integrating time-series scRNA- seq data and DrivAER for tracing developmental trajectories and identifying driving transcription factors in craniofacial development. We will validate the methods using scRNA-seq datasets from the FaceBase consortium and to-be-generated data for mouse palate formation. Aim 3. To experimentally validate and characterize the top ranked novel mutations (Aim 1) and regulators (Aim 2). Building on our previous studies, strong preliminary data and highly experienced team, this proposal is timely to develop machine learning methods to effectively address the current gap between the genomics studies in murine craniofacial development and human genetic studies of orofacial clefts. The successful completion will provide 1) the NIDCR research community a suite of novel methods and analytical tools for genomic/epigenomic/scRNA-seq data, and 2) the mechanistic assessment on the mutations/genes and transcriptional regulators that are potentially involved in OFCs and related craniofacial diseases. Project Narrative Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases; however, these data are highly heterogeneous, limiting the analysis for the understanding of DOC biology and discovery of causal mutations and regulators in DOC diseases.

"Deep-learning based profiling of patient-derived cells as a tool for genomic and translational medicine Project Summary/Abstract: The genetic landscape of rare and common diseases has emerged as heterogeneous and complex. Already, researchers and clinicians face the challenge to discern pathophysiological mechanism and treatment opportunities for hundreds of genetic subtypes that have been identified in rare diseases, such as inherited neuropathies (INs) or mitochondrial diseases (MiDs) alone. Still, a large fraction of disease loci remains to be discovered – a daunting task, since gene-identification studies often require immense sample-sizes, which are difficult to achieve, even for more common conditions. Simultaneously, much of the heritability of many disorders appears to be determined by the collective impact of possibly thousands of low-impact variants, spread across the genome. Ideally, the impact of a given set of candidate variants could be assessed within high-throughput framework that accounts for the genetic context of individual patients. Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms, we have developed an unbiased, scalable method to rapidly identify disease- associated phenotypes in high-resolution, multiplexed, fluorescent microscopy images of primary, patient derived cells. In turn, the discovered phenotypes can be exploited as experimental signals against which the disease relevance of candidate variants can be confirmed, by virtue of genetic complementation experiments. At the same time, the standardized and scalable nature of our method renders it suitable to test potential therapeutic interventions, e.g. to test the efficacy of potential gene-therapy, or to screen small molecule libraries, while maintaining patient-specific granularity. The goal of this proposal is to apply our approach to an expanded cohort of patient cells and to refine methods to interpret both genetic and pharmacological perturbations. In this, I will be supported by an exceptional and multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical, molecular and functional genetics, and computer scientists, within the world-class scientific environment offered by Columbia University and the Broad Institute. In a carefully designed development plan, I will finalize my training in machine learning and data science, expand my expertise to single-cell RNA-sequencing and other single-cell methods, and acquire essential leadership and scholarly skills required for an independent research career. Over the course of this award, I will apply our cellular profiling approach to generate a standardized map of deep, quantitative descriptions of disease-associated cellular phenotypes across a number of INs, MiDs and neurodegenerative conditions. We will explore the integration of RNA-sequencing to enhance our approach. Finally, we will apply our method to the discovery and confirmation of new disease genes, and screen a limited number of pharmacological interventions through our method. Together, the proposed developmental plan and research strategy will foster my ability to lead an independent research program, to establish cellular profiling as a powerful platform to advance genomic and translational medicine. Project Narrative: The functional interpretation of genetic variation in diseases faces critical roadblocks, due to the lack of scalable methods to assess the significance of candidate variants experimentally, while accounting for genomic context. This proposal introduces a morphological profiling method, that is able to rapidly identify disease-associated phenotypes in patient cells and offers a cost-efficient and unbiased way to determine the significance of putative pathogenic variants at scale.

"Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most disease-associated variants lie in non-coding regions of the genome and exert their influence through effects on gene expression. However, we lack a predictive framework to interpret such non-coding variants, limiting how genomic data is used in precision medicine. We may be able to interpret non-coding variants with new machine learning algorithms, but so far the practical applications of machine learning in functional genomics have been limited because of two major challenges. First, the size and diversity of training data sets in functional genomics are orders of magnitude smaller than in applications where machine learning has been successful, such as image recognition and product recommendation. A second challenge is that if training data are not collected in an appropriate in vitro cellular model, then the resulting machine learning models may not generalize to relevant in vivo cell types. To improve the application of machine learning to non-coding variants, I propose to address both the limited size of training data sets and the efficacy of cell culture models. A core principle of machine learning is that model performance improves with more data. In Aim 1, I propose to increase the size and diversity of training data by performing iterative cycles of machine learning and experimental validation with Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs). The key aspect of my approach is to algorithmically design each successive MPRA library to contain sequences that are most likely to improve the next round of modeling. I recently trained my first model on data that I collected from MPRA experiments of cis-regulatory sequences that function in mammalian photoreceptors. To avoid any issues with cell lines, I performed these experiments in ex vivo developing retinas, which retain the appropriate tissue architecture. However, unlike photoreceptors, most cell types are not experimentally tractable in their native physiological context. Thus, it will be important to determine how well in vitro cell lines recapitulate in vivo cis-regulation. In Aim 2, I propose to determine whether a tractable cell culture model can recapitulate results from ex vivo retinas. I will use existing MPRA data from ex vivo retinas as a standard to compare against data collected in cell lines engineered to express combinations of photoreceptor transcription factors. I aim to address whether engineering tractable cell lines to express tissue-specific transcription factors might be a general approach for collecting data to train machine learning models that generalize to in vivo systems. Successful completion of these aims will produce a general approach to increase the size and diversity of functional genomic training data, and may result in a general method for producing experimentally tractable systems for machine learning applications, ultimately helping us better apply genomic data to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many genetic variants that cause disease do not affect the structure of genes, but instead affect short DNA sequences that control when, where, or how much a gene is produced. Every individual human contains thousands of genetic variants in these control regions, but only a small number of these variants influence gene production. I propose a combined experimental and computational framework to predict which variants affect gene production and which variants are harmless.",Interpreting function of non-coding sequences with synthetic biology and machine learning,10177882,F31HG011431,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Architecture', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Performance', 'Photoreceptors', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Reporter', 'Retina', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'cellular engineering', 'computer framework', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'practical application', 'precision medicine', 'synthetic biology', 'transcription factor']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,31970
"Analysis of Poison Exon Inclusion in Genes Associated with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Over one in one hundred infants born are affected by neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which can cause a host of debilitating symptoms including early-onset seizures, developmental delay, and intellectual disability. Application of whole exome/genome sequencing to examine NDD has revealed many disease-causing variations, but in a substantial proportion of cases the genetic cause remains undetermined. The analysis of deep-intronic non-coding variants has provided diagnosis when coding variation cannot be implicated in disease. For example, intronic variants in the “20N” poison exon of SCN1A results in loss of function, causing Dravet Syndrome, an NDD causing prolonged seizures in the first year of life. Poison exons are a mechanism of gene regulation whereby a premature termination codon caused by inclusion of the poison exon induces nonsense- mediated decay of the mRNA transcript. Preliminary analysis has shown that poison exon inclusion (PEI) in SCN1A and SCN8A decreases during embryonic brain development, inversely proportional to total RNA expression. The brain is a hotbed of alternative splicing during early neuronal development therefore it is plausible, if not probable that novel poison exons remain uncharacterized. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that PEI is a mechanism to differentiallyregulate gene expression during earlyneuronal development, and intronic variants affecting PEI in genes of developmental importance contribute to disease phenotype. In Aim 1, the sodium and calcium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit families will be assessed to detect and characterize novel poison exons. Known and novel PEI will then be determined in the developing brain using publicly available RNA-seq experiments. In Aim 2 this analysis will be scaled up over 100-fold to detect and assess PEI in over 3000 genes associated with NDD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in the developing brain and the driving forces of PEI evolution will be assessed. Comparative analysis of poison exons will be conducted using k-means hierarchical clustering and unsupervised random forest machine learning methodologies to determine prime biological factors driving PEI utilization. In Aim 3, intronic variants will be analyzed in probands of NDD and ASD in regions of known and hypothetical PEI and the affect these variants have on disease phenotype will be computationally assessed. These experiments will reveal new insights into alternative splicing in the developing brain and provide potential genetic explanation of currently unknown NDD disease phenotype. The research will be conducted at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, which allows developing scientists to hone skills in a dynamic, hands-on environment with supplemental training courses as necessary. Besides the research outlined in the proposal, training will include courses in conduct of responsible research, advanced biostatistics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and wet lab techniques next to personal development to improve oral and written communication and presentation skills as well as time management. Project Narrative Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs) are debilitating early-onset diseases estimated to affect 1-2% of the population, and the cause of a substantial proportion of these cases remains unknown. Our lab has recently implicated causative variants in poison exons, a cryptic alternatively spliced exon causing transcript degradation via nonsense-mediated decay. The proposed research aims to examine the role of poison exon inclusion in the regulation of genes associated with NDD during neurological development, providing insights into alternative splicing in the brain and provide essential information for diagnosis and potential therapeutics for patients with NDD.",Analysis of Poison Exon Inclusion in Genes Associated with Neurodevelopmental Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorder,10234717,F31MH126628,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Factors', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Calcium Channel', 'Catalogs', 'Cations', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Evolution', 'Exons', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Nonsense-Mediated Decay', 'Onset of illness', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Truncation', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'SCN8A gene', 'Scientist', 'Seizures', 'Sodium', 'Sodium Channel', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Terminator Codon', 'Tetrapoda', 'Therapeutic', 'Time Management', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'career development', 'causal variant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'comparative genomics', 'disabling symptom', 'disease phenotype', 'dravet syndrome', 'driving force', 'early onset', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Precursor', 'member', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prevent', 'proband', 'random forest', 'responsible research conduct', 'scale up', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'voltage', 'voltage gated channel']",NIMH,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,F31,2021,42792
"Integrative approaches to identification and interpretation of genes underlying psychiatric disorders Psychiatric disorders contribute substantially to the disease burden in the United States and worldwide. There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to many psychiatric illnesses. In recent years, with the advancement of high throughput genomic technologies and the availability of large samples, remarkable success has been made in risk gene discovery for major psychiatric disorders [e.g., schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)] through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, due to the high complexity of the human genome, few causal genes or variants have been identified within GWAS risk loci, thus, to date, limiting the potential of translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms. There is now a great need to pinpoint causal genes/variants at the known GWAS risk loci and to understand their causal mechanisms, as well as to discover novel genes from novel risk loci. There is also growing evidence that risk variants from GWAS tend to be located in regulatory DNA regions in disease-relevant tissues or cell types, suggesting that risk variants may act through regulation of gene expression. Studies leveraging diverse functional genomic resources may benefit psychiatric risk gene discovery and result in better prediction of their biological relevance. This proposal aims to employ highly integrative approaches to identify causal genes and regulatory noncoding variants underlying SCZ, BD, and MDD. Our specific aims are: 1) Integrate GWAS with brain methylome for risk gene discovery, by leveraging a dense high-resolution reference panel of DNAm from whole genome bisulfite sequencing of DNA from three different brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate) and an enlarged array-based reference panel; 2) Apply a deep learning approach to predicting disease-relevant regulatory variants, by employing features from disease-relevant gene regulatory networks and functional genomic annotations within brain tissues and neural cell types; and 3) Map prioritized genes and variants to specific brain cell types and brain function. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with expertise in psychiatric genetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Our goal is to apply multidisciplinary and cutting-edge analytical strategies to help address the challenges arising in the post-GWAS era. The identification and characterization of risk genes and noncoding regulatory variants would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illnesses, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment for these disorders.

"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,10085248,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'computational pipelines', 'data pipeline', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,563248
"Identifying causal genetic variants and molecular mechanisms impacting mental health Identifying how genetic variation leads to neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders provides new means to study, predict, prevent and treat disease. Identifying the immediate molecular consequences of disease- associated genetic variation has necessitated the development of large-scale, multi-tissue functional genomic resources. Projects such as GTEx, Roadmap Epigenomics Project and PsychENCODE have combined molecular QTL mapping and epigenomic maps in bulk tissues to interpret various disease-associated genetic variants. However, few colocalizations between molecular QTLs and traits have been robustly identified and few causal variants mapped. As tissues like the brain constitute 100s of cell-types, we hypothesize that existing maps may mask the contributions of disease-associated variation in less-abundant cell types. One extremely powerful approach to identify cell-type specific molecular effects and their relationship to genetic diseases is through application of chromatin accessibility data – these data both allow inference of causal cell types and provide base level resolution gene regulation. Our team has considerable expertise in connecting GWAS to molecular functions and predicting causal variants through use of chromatin accessibility data. We have additionally recently collaborated to generate a comprehensive, multi-individual map single cell ATAC- seq map (scATAC-seq) of six different brain regions to detect causal cell types and predict causal variants. This work has been recently demonstrated in our fine-mapping study of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (Corces et al, bioRxiv, 2020) but has not been systematically applied to mental health disorders. We propose to develop statistical genetics and machine learning approaches that advance the use of scATAC-seq data to connecting mental health GWAS loci to specific cell types, mechanisms and causal variants. In Aim 1, we will assemble a pipeline that leverages region and cell type-specific scATAC-seq data to identify pathological cell types for 100s of mental health and brain-related traits. We will also enhance the detection of cell-type specific molecular mechanisms by extending and applying a novel GWAS/QTL colocalization approach. Throughout these activities, variants will be validated using massively-parallel reporter assays (MPRA). In Aim 2, we will develop sophisticated machine learning models that learn regulatory grammars and score variants across the allele frequency spectrum. Predicted causal variants in GWAS loci will be further assessed with MPRAs in Aim 1 and applied in Aim 3. In Aim 3, we will demonstrate how improved detection of causal variants using our single-cell informed models aids transferability of polygenic risk scores across populations.  We will provide open resources and reproducible computational methods and pipelines that integrate single cell chromatin accessibility data from multiple brain regions. This will allow detection cell-type specific genetic effects and pathological cell types in mental health GWAS, establish robust causal links between variants, genes and disease, and improve prediction of disease risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Identifying causal genetic variants in mental health disease is a major challenge limiting interpretation of disease biology, prediction of risk and development of therapies.

"Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Hemoglobin (Hb) disorders are among the world's most common monogenic diseases. Nearly 7% of the world’s population carry Hb gene variants. Sickle cell disease (SCD) arises when Hb mutations are inherited homozygously (HbSS) or paired with another β-globin gene mutation. Globally, an estimated 400,000 babies are born annually with SCD, and 70%-75% are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is estimated that 50-90% in SSA die by their 5th birthday, 70% of these deaths are preventable. Effective management of SCD involves early diagnosis, and genetic counselling, and, importantly, nationwide newborn screening (NBS). NBS programs utilizing centralized laboratories have dramatically reduced SCD mortality in high-resource countries. NBS requires sensitive detection of relatively low levels of Hb variants in the presence of high fetal Hb (HbF). Normal HbA and sickle HbS should be accurately identified in the presence of high levels (up to 90%) of HbF. The current gold standard for Hb variant testing is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which requires expensive equipment and reagents, highly trained personnel, and modern laboratories. In low- resource regions, very few centralized laboratories can perform costly Hb testing. Testing is not available to the large percentage of infants born outside of a major hospital or city. There is an unmet need for affordable, portable, easy-to-use, accurate, point-of-care (POC) tests to facilitate decentralized Hb testing to enable nationwide NBS programs. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed Hb electrophoresis as an essential in vitro diagnostic in low- and middle-income countries. We have developed a POC microchip electrophoresis Hb variant testing system, MicroChip Electrophoresis (MCE), under the product name “Gazelle Hb Variant” by Hemex Health, Inc. MCE reports Hb phenotype, Hb quantification (%Hb), and an interpretive statement showing genotype (such as SCD, Sickle Cell Trait, or Normal). MCE has been extensively validated for hemoglobinopathies, including SCD, hemoglobin E disease, and thalassemia. Newborns and infants below 6 weeks of age have very low concentrations of Hb variants other than Hb F which is high, therefore an improvement to lower the limit of detection (LoD) is needed to support NBS programs worldwide. By decreasing the LoD from the current 10% to 2%, newborns and infants can be screened with this affordable system. The innovation in this SBIR Phase I is the integration of multi-spectral imaging and machine learning based data analysis capability to MCE to develop MCE+ to accurately screen newborns for common Hb variants. We propose the following aims: Aim 1: Integrate multi-spectral imaging and machine learning algorithm into the MCE platform to enable identification and quantification of hemoglobin variants in newborns. Aim 2: Perform clinical testing of the MCE+ multi-spectral newborn screening system. Significance of this project is that MCE+ is the only affordable POC system for quantitative and objective hemoglobin variant testing that allows screening at birth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Up to 50 to 90% of children born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in economically disadvantaged countries (over 400,000 per year) die before the age of five, although the WHO estimates that 70% could be saved through simple, cost-effective treatments. Early diagnosis starting at birth is critical for implementing effective disease management, but newborn screening is a challenge for low resource environments where a decentralized, point-of-care solution is needed. This project enables our affordable, point-of-care platform based on microchip electrophoresis technology to accurately perform newborn screening.",Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease,10255480,R43HL156685,"['Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Age', 'Bedside Testings', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Care Technology Points', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Electrophoresis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Fetal Hemoglobin', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genotype', 'Ghana', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin E Disease', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'India', 'Infant', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Microchip Electrophoresis', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Population', 'Race', 'Reagent', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Cell Trait', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Southeastern Asia', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'beta Globin', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective treatment', 'detection limit', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'preventable death', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sickling', 'spectrograph', 'trait']",NHLBI,"HEMEX HEALTH, INC.",R43,2021,256580
"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,10192782,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'regression algorithm', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,190941
"Germline Structural Variant Identification and Functional Determination in Childhood Cancer Abstract A few germline pathogenic structural variants (SV) have been identified in cancer predisposition syndromes, e.g., MSH2 inversion in Lynch syndrome. The advent of short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the detection of SVs. However, a pitfall of this sequencing methodology is the inability to capture all SVs, given the reads do not map well to low complexity regions, and current algorithms used to identify SVs from short-read data have very low sensitivity and very high false-positive rates. One of the objectives of this fellowship is to optimize and implement an SV calling pipeline that utilizes multiple algorithms to increase the sensitivity and specificity of variant identification from germline short-read WGS trios. This pipeline is currently being developed and tested on pediatric cancer patients enrolled in the NIH-funded Baylor Advancing Sequencing into Childhood Cancer Care (BASIC3) exome study, which consists of ethnically and racially diverse pediatric patients with solid (CNS and non-CNS) tumors. This BASIC3 subset includes 63 proband/parent trios who have subsequently undergone germline short-read WGS. Five SV callers are run and then filtered using either a percent reciprocal overlap filter or a proposed Artificial Intelligence-based proximity graph filter to identify de novo and inherited SVs. This cohort has recently been selected for a long-read sequencing pilot, data which serves as the gold standard for SV detection. Comparison of short-read WGS generated SV calls with the long- read data will help determine the sensitivity and specificity of variant calls and further improve the short read pipeline (Aim 1A). Once optimized this short-read WGS SV pipeline will be applied to the Kids First Genetics of Embryonal and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma cohort (n=900), as an independent assessment of the method and also to identify recurrent germline SVs in this cancer which has not yet been well characterized (Aim 1B). The second training and scientific objective is to explore the functional effect of a novel de novo SV identified through the initial analysis. A de novo germline duplication of the Prostaglandin Reductase 2 (PTGR2) enhancer and promoter region was found in a pediatric Posterior Fossa subtype A (PF–A) ependymoma patient. Transcriptome data from the patient’s tumor revealed increased PTGR2 expression. The PTGR2 protein converts 15-keto- prostaglandin E2 to 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGE2. Studies in adult malignancies suggest that increased 15-keto- 13,14-dihydro-PGE2 is associated with cancer risk potentially through the STAT3 signaling pathway. Increased STAT3 signaling is reported as a distinct feature of PF-A ependymoma. The identified partial duplication of PTGR2 will be engineered into ependymoma progenitor cells, to functionally assess the effects on STAT3 signaling, cell proliferation, and DNA synthesis. In parallel, further analysis of PTGR2 expression and structural variants will be analyzed in pediatric ependymoma cohorts (Aim 2). Completion of this experimental plan and described training activities under Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic will provide Owen Hirschi highly interdisciplinary training in analysis of genomic data, structural variation, and the downstream effects on pediatric cancer biology. Project Narrative Structural variation occurring in the germline of pediatric patients is linked to cancer-predisposition, however the tools used to identify these events from short-read whole genome sequencing are often erroneous and limited. This project will seek to optimize a pipeline that can more accurately identify these events and determine the functional effects of one of these identified events. Such studies are essential to accurately determine how often these events occur and whether they play a broader role in pediatric cancers, as well, if these events can influence clinical care and potential cancer prevention.",Germline Structural Variant Identification and Functional Determination in Childhood Cancer,10314873,F31CA265163,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Ependymoma', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Dinoprostone', 'Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Enrollment', 'Ependymal Cell', 'Ependymoma', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Inherited', 'Interleukin-6', 'Link', 'MSH2 gene', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Neuroglia', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Play', 'Posterior Fossa', 'Predisposition', 'Promoter Regions', 'Prostaglandins', 'Proteins', 'Radial', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Role', 'Running', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Stat3 Signaling Pathway', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Tumor Promoters', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer care', 'cancer predisposition', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'functional gain', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant stomach neoplasm', 'nerve stem cell', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'proband', 'promoter', 'racial diversity', 'stem cells', 't(9', '22)(q34', 'q11)', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'variant detection', 'whole genome']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,F31,2021,43631
"Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits Project Summary  Over the past decade, data generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to analyze heritability of human diseases and complex traits to improve understanding of genetic architecture, including identifying the genetic variants associated with diseases and their effect sizes. These heritability enrichment analyses have revealed underlying biological mechanisms such as regulatory elements involved in disease pathways. This research proposes statistical methods and analysis to formally assess the contribution of biological pathways, gene networks, and re-prioritized functional annotations to the genetic architecture of 94 human diseases and complex traits. Better understanding of disease architecture will improve genome-wide associations and fine mapping and provides robust inference of disease etiology and mechanisms.  The first aim is to determine the contribution of disease-associated gene pathways to disease heritability. It is well known that an abnormality in individual genes rarely causes a human disease. Large-scale pathway analysis will elucidate disease pathways by constructing functional annotations and applying an existing polygenic method to partition heritability. Furthermore, pathway analyses on candidate genes identified via whole-exome sequencing (WES) data will inform new biological inference. The resulting set of enriched pathway-trait pairs will further help with independent validation of previously reported associations and for novel associations enriched for trait heritability.  The second aim is to determine the contribution of gene network to disease heritability across 94 diseases, focusing on hub genes defined by a broad set of network connectivity metrics. The contribution of gene network to disease heritability has been only partially answered, limited to few network connectivity metrics across 42 diseases. Comprehensive analysis of gene sets informed by published gene networks will inform a new direction of integrating gene networks to infer biological mechanisms of human diseases. In addition, visualization method for large-scale gene networks will greatly enhance research translation, serving as a useful resource for studying gene-gene interactions for potential drugs and therapeutic targets.  The third aim is to de-noise and re-prioritize Mendelian annotations to infer candidate genes. Despite considerable process on prioritizing rare variants impacting Mendelian diseases, little is known about the utility of these Mendelian pathogenicity scores for common disease. I will conduct heritability enrichment analyses to answer informativeness of Mendelian disease pathogenicity scores for common disease. To further improve their informativeness, I propose a machine learning variant reprioritization framework. Ultimately, this project will produce (1) a detailed understanding of disease-associated biological pathways to disease heritability, (2) a set of functional annotations informed by gene networks significantly enriched for disease heritability, and (3) a new method to prioritize variants and identifying candidate genes based on diverse genomic features. Project Narrative Understanding human genetic variations, from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to mutations, offers a great potential in uncovering underlying disease mechanisms by identifying new disease-associated genes and in discovering potential drug targets and therapeutics. This proposed studies aim to understand the role of these genetic variations in trait heritability, leveraging disease-associated biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations. The developed method to prioritize variants and genes will answer the contribution of gene pathways, gene sets informed by gene networks, and Mendelian pathogenicity scores to disease heritability.","Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits",10126720,F31HG010818,"['Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'denoising', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'fitness', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'open source', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2021,46036
