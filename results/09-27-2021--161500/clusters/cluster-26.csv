"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9645316,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,172692,0.15930996426430577
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9610723,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2019,794994,0.10791706918344743
"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms. Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

"Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges ABSTRACT CVD disparities across the race/ethnic and socioeconomic gradients are exacerbated by barriers to receiving guideline-based primary or secondary preventive treatment—such as appropriate blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes treatment.1–6 Most patients not receiving guideline-based treatment are actually insured and have seen a primary care provider in the past year.1 To reduce CVD disparities by better targeting disease prevention and treatment, healthcare administrators and county departments of public health have begun pooling data resources across healthcare and public health systems—such as across clinics, emergency rooms and hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and administrative datasets.7–9 The idea behind pooling such datasets is to better identify persons most in need, and direct targeted interventions to them. Solano County, California, a medium-sized, diverse, low-income county, has developed one of the first, and most comprehensive health information exchanges (HIEs), including: (i) electronic health record data from all emergency rooms, hospitals, primary care and specialty clinics and care facilities in the county; (ii) labs from all laboratory service providers; (iii) prescription details from all pharmacies; (iv) validated social determinants of health surveys administered in clinics; and (v) administrative datasets, including welfare, disability, housing, and geocoded neighborhood features. While several other counties are following suit to develop large, secure HIEs across healthcare and public health systems, a key challenge remains: how to cheaply, accurately, and rapidly analyze HIEs to identify which persons should be targeted for interventions. Without reliable, user- friendly, cost-effective, and generalizable data analysis programs, counties are unable to use the massive data at their disposal to address preventable causes of morbidity and mortality. The objective of this application is to apply our unique machine-learning innovations to develop open-source programs that can enable counties to identify persons at high risk for preventable CVD events and deaths. We will test the hypothesis that electronic health record data alone are insufficient to provide accurate risk prediction for preventable CVD events and deaths. Rather, we believe that key survey and administrative data providing information on social determinants of health will improve identification of high-risk patients. To test our hypothesis, we will develop and validate open-source, generalizable programs to: (Aim 1) rapidly identify persons in need of improved primary and secondary prevention of CVD by systematically comparing the performance of three alternative machine learning approaches to read HIE data, as compared to human clinician chart reviewers; and (Aim 2) perform multi-level risk assessment by automatically calibrating and validating models of CVD event risk, utilization and cost to HIE data, to identify the added value of administrative and social determinants data as compared to clinical or claims-based data alone. Our work will produce generalizable software tools for counties across the country to analyze HIE data and reduce preventable CVD disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities are exacerbated by inadequate guideline-based treatment of CVD risk factors. Furthermore, risk adjustment models currently used to target interventions and pay for healthcare services only use claims-based data such as demographics and clinical diagnostic codes, ignoring social determinants of health. Our research will rigorously develop and test novel machine learning methods that incorporate social determinants data from large Health Information Exchanges, producing novel data tools that will enable health systems nationwide to better detect individuals who could use improvements in their preventive therapy for CVD, and improve risk adjustment models to identify persons at high risk for preventable healthcare utilization and cost.",Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges,9766361,R21MD012867,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Case Management', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Surveys', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Neighborhoods', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primary Health Care', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Secure', 'Social Work', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Unemployment', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'care providers', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disorder prevention', 'health care service', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'payment', 'programs', 'prospective', 'residence', 'risk prediction model', 'safety net', 'semiparametric', 'service providers', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'user-friendly', 'welfare']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,190864,0.12318335857284961
"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data. In patients with diabetes at risk of cardiovascular disease events, I will examine the impact that missing data has on the ability to use the EHR for clinical research and develop approaches to address the biases resulting from missing data.",Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD,9742515,K01HL140146,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Baptist Church', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Privacy', 'Publishing', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'South Carolina', 'Stroke', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'care seeking', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'distributed data', 'electronic data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'practical application', 'professor', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'study population']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,165554,0.0495756790443429
"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience. By further identifying possible interventions that target this vulnerability, this work seeks to decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms.",Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome,9769513,F31HL140943,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alexithymias', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Anger', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Common Core', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'alcohol risk', 'allostasis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'graph theory', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,38616,0.013433633984718854
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988.

"Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology Project Summary/Abstract The candidate’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on the neurophysiological pathways that link psychological stress with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individual differences in biological responses to acute psychological stress have been shown to predict risk for subclinical and clinical markers of CVD, indicating that variation in the stress response relates to measurable health outcomes. The proposed research and career development program will position the candidate to definitively address open and mechanistic questions on cardiovascular stress physiology with a multi-dimensional approach. The overall objective of the current project is to identify the ‘brain–cardiovascular’ pathways of metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress. The central hypothesis is that metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress are caused by increased brain activation in areas associated with cardiovascular and autonomic control. In extension, the candidate will test whether altering brain function via neuromodulation will regulate downstream cardiovascular responses. Proposed are two independent studies. In Aim 1, we will newly examine the relationship between metabolically excessive cardiovascular and neural responses using a cross-sectional approach. In Aim 2, we will measure stressor-evoked metabolic and cardiovascular responses before and after neuromodulation in an experimental approach. Participants will engage in a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique, transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS), known to alter the brain by increasing oxygenation, and will be compared to an established control. This research plan will help the candidate develop essential skills for career development including cardiovascular and metabolic testing, machine learning and cross-validation methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, and utilizing a neuromodulation technique, TILS. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide 5 years of training through a combination of research, classroom experiences, and mentoring to further the candidate in preparation for scientific independence. Specifically, the candidate will gain expertise in measuring metabolic activity, advance her computational neuroimaging analysis skills, become proficient in experimentally manipulating brain function, and develop necessary statistical skills. The project brings together a mentoring team of experts in their respective areas to provide the candidate with the necessary skills to continue on the trajectory to make a transformative contribution to the field of Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine. This project will provide vital information regarding the pathways between psychological stress and CVD risk while at the same time providing training and mentoring for the candidate’s further career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exaggerated physiological responses to psychological stress are commonly regarded as contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonetheless, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which psychological responses to threat are translated into cardiovascular responses that are excessive to the immediate physiological needs of the individual. The project will use both cross-sectional and experimental approaches to examine how the brain and cardiovascular system interact during psychological stress and will provide a a more comprehensive understanding of the role the brain plays in metabolically-excessive responses to stress. This research is relevant to public health because it is a crucial step in understanding how psychological stress relates to a risk factor for CVD and is necessary to develop appropriate brain- based approaches to CVD risk prevention and stratification.",Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology,9821766,K01HL145021,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Markers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Limbic System', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Professional Competence', 'Program Development', 'Psychological Stress', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'experience', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stressor', 'time use']",NHLBI,BAYLOR UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,152227,0.11843202306456174
"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,9798942,R01AG063887,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'black/white disparity', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'critical period', 'dementia risk', 'early life exposure', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'heart function', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'treatment strategy', 'trend', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2019,829290,0.1271394987862623
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9650406,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'glutaryl coA', 'individual response', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,410983,0.12320791720860534
"Stasys Medical: A Rapid, Microfluidic Blood Test Sensitive to Platelet Dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US. While monitoring platelet therapy is of increasing importance for the identification of hypo- or hyper-responsive patients, there is not a clear picture of the medical value of tailored antiplatelet therapy using currently available platelet function tests. Currently, US FDA cleared assays of platelet function designed to be near the patient measure platelet adhesion and aggregation. Stasys Medical is developing a system based on patented platelet contraction sensors to assay platelet contraction force as a biomarker for platelet dysfunction. In the current project, the Company will build on preliminary data to demonstrate that the force biomarker is sensitive to platelet inhibition via multiple pathways. Specifically, aims are designed to 1) correlate the platelet contractile force measurements to inhibition of platelet activation and adhesion pathways, and 2) benchmark the force assay to standard platelet function tests. The go/no-go criteria for moving to Phase II is demonstration that platelet force is sensitive to specific inhibitors and that the assay can identify platelet dysfunction currently missed by existing standard platelet function assays. In the Phase II project we will leverage data generated in the current project to develop an algorithm that can automatically identify antiplatelet medications. Clinically, this will be a valuable tool to identify medication non-responders. Taken together, the project will be used to support the Company’s 510(k) submission to FDA with claims directed at evaluating platelet function to assess clinical conditions, such as bleeding risk, associated with the use of antiplatelet drugs, and during and following cardiovascular surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antiplatelet medications are a critical component to manage cardiovascular diseases (CVD), which is a prevalent affliction in the US. In the Phase I project, Stasys Medical will build on preliminary data to show that the platelet contraction force biomarker reflects platelet function as proof-of-concept that the force assay can identify platelet dysfunction missed by existing assays.

"Applying statistical learning tools to personalize cardiovascular treatment Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) treatment is often guided by risk stratification tools (to decide who to treat), and randomized controlled trials (to decide which treatments to select). Prior CVD research reveals two major  obstacles to improving our treatment approach: (i) longitudinal cohort data are unavailable for recalibrating risk stratification tools for local-area estimation (by zip code), or for people with major CVD-promoting  comorbidities (e.g., chronic kidney disease); and (ii) the average treatment effect in randomized trials can be highly erroneous when projected onto individuals that vary from the ‘average’ participant in a trial. CVD risk- stratification and treatment effect estimation can be improved and personalized if we overcome a critical barrier to progress: correctly estimating risk and treatment effect from new, large participant data repositories, which have greater population size and include patients with more co-morbid conditions than common cohort studies, and which permit personalized risk/benefit prediction tool development from individual-level data. Our prior studies show that we can critically advance the field by applying novel statistical learning methods to this data, to address: (i) false-positives from multiple testing; (ii) the reliance on standard regressions that cannot account for non-linear, complex interactions between factors; and (iii) identifying the optimal approach among many alternative statistical learning methods. We propose to apply our work in these areas to (Aim 1) Develop CVD risk stratification tools for patients with inadequate sample sizes in common cohort studies. We will enhance CVD risk stratification to include local-area adjustment (by zip code) and major co-morbid conditions affecting CVD risk (e.g., chronic kidney disease). We will additionally (Aim 2) develop personalized treatment effect  prediction tools to guide decisions for CVD therapies with high potential benefit and risk, for therapies where  individual participant data from trials are available. We have obtained the individual participant data from the large randomized trials that reveal wide variations in CVD risk reduction and serious adverse event risk increase from three drug classes: non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, intensive blood pressure treatment, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors for diabetes. Our preliminary research shows that traditional  regression methods cannot distinguish which patients are most likely to benefit or be harmed by such therapies, but our statistical learning methods can. Finally, we will (Aim 3) develop open-source tools to improve the ability of researchers to choose an optimal statistical learning approach for their dataset and problem. While numerous statistical learning methods have been proposed in the literature, a key problem for biomedical scientists  without access to RCT data is: which method should I use to estimate treatment effects from observational data? Building on our innovative approach to identify the optimal inference method for observational data, we will construct an open-source tool to compare methods, identifying which method most often results in optimal treatment decisions that minimize error and maximize performance on standardized metrics. Public health relevance  Using current cardiovascular disease risk stratification tools, about 31.6 million Americans will receive an incorrect cardiovascular disease risk estimate that will lead to wrong treatment, per current guidelines.  Furthermore, extrapolating the average treatment effect for major preventive cardiovascular disease treatments— rather than calculating a personalized risk/benefit score—contributes to 4.9 million serious adverse events from treatment complications each year. In this project, we seek to address both problems: improving  cardiovascular disease risk stratification, and developing personalized calculators for risk and benefit of major  cardiovascular disease treatments.",Applying statistical learning tools to personalize cardiovascular treatment,9637461,R01HL144555,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anticoagulants', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Fasting', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population Sizes', 'Preventive', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Reduction', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Sodium', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'adverse event risk', 'biomedical scientist', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'clinical care', 'data warehouse', 'editorial', 'fasting glucose', 'health data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'stroke risk', 'symporter', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,774381,0.13430851553754716
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B).

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions. There is however, considerable interindividual variation in efficacy of statins for reducing disease risk, as well as in susceptibility to the most common adverse statin effects, myopathy and type 2 diabetes. The goal of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply complementary investigative approaches and multidisciplinary expertise for discovering and validating the genetic and metabolic factors responsible for this variability. This information has the potential for optimizig use of statins in clinical practice, and for identifying new pathways that underlie the diverse biologic actions of this drug class.              ",Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy,9772486,P50GM115318,"['Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug effect disorder', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'In Vitro', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Informatics', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscle function', 'Myopathy', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Simvastatin', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Visualization software', 'adverse outcome', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker identification', 'blood glucose regulation', 'candidate validation', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'coronary event', 'data integration', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'exome', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genotyped patients', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'inter-individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblast', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'population based', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'side effect', 'statistics', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL & RES CTR AT OAKLAND,P50,2019,1524688,0.1403879001586769
"Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in older adults. Statins are highly effective cholesterol-lowering medications used for primary prevention of CVD, and are the most commonly prescribed medications. After age 75, data on the effects of statins are limited to guide statin prescribing recommendations. However, even where the evidence is clear, statins remain under-prescribed. Reasons for under-prescribing of proven CVD prevention medications such as statins in older adults are many, and may include competing medical conditions, adverse side effects (e.g., myalgias), and frailty. Frailty is a multidimensional state of decreased physiologic reserve associated with an increased risk of CVD and poor clinical outcomes. The aging population is heterogeneous and a one-size fits all approach may not be appropriate. In particular, understanding the utility of statins for prevention of CVD in individuals who are vulnerable or frail is critical. Therefore, the research activities in this GEMSSTAR award will use a retrospective design to (1) understand patterns of statin use in a large cohort of older US veterans aged 65 and older, over 15 years of follow up, with particular attention to the relationship between frailty, myalgias and statin use; and (2) examine the association between statin use for primary prevention of CVD in pre-frail and frail older veterans and cardiovascular events, health care utilization, and mortality. This work will inform the design of future clinical trials of statins for prevention of CVD in older adults accounting for heterogeneity of aging and frailty. In addition to the pharmacoepidemiologic study proposed, this GEMSSTAR award includes mentorship, coursework, and seminars in advanced epidemiologic and statistical methods, geriatrics, and cardiology. The research and career development activities will prepare the applicant for her long-term goal of a research career in geriatric preventive cardiology and will inform preventive care for the aging population. As the population ages, identifying preventive strategies for heart disease and stroke is a priority. However, proven preventive medications such as the cholesterol-lowering statins remain underused. In this study, we aim to understand patterns of statin use in older adults to shed light on why statins may be underused even where evidence is clear, and to examine whether statins are useful in preventing heart disease and stroke in older adults who are vulnerable or frail.","Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults",9753091,R03AG060169,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Role', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging population', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'prevent', 'research and development', 'side effect', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R03,2019,96525,0.11942853043687954
"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,9659038,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'effectiveness research', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,492573,0.056050163343076935
"Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 70% of older adults and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor- tality in the United States. Several new drugs have recently been approved for CVD, but not enough is known about their utilization, benefits and risks in frail older patients. Since conducting a clinical trial in frail older adults can be costly and impractical, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to generate evidence on new CVD drugs in a timely manner. The objective of this application is to establish a near-real-time prospective monitoring program in Medicare data to evaluate the benefit of new CVD drugs for older adults with frailty. A prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. The investigators will incorporate a novel claims-based frailty index into the monitoring program to generate timely evidence on disease-specific and patient-centered net benefit of new drugs by frailty status. The central hypothesis is that disease-specific benefit and net benefit are determined by a patient's degree of frailty. Disease-specific benefit will be evaluated using clinical trial endpoints of effectiveness (e.g., CVD events) and safety (e.g., bleeding), and net benefit in terms of the number of days alive and spent at home, or “home time”. To conduct this work, the investigators will analyze Medicare data on 6 new CVD drugs approved in 2011-2017: 3 anticoagulants vs warfarin for atrial fibrillation, 2 antiplatelets vs clopidogrel for atherosclerotic CVD, and an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor vs enalapril for systolic heart failure. The validity and reproducibility of the results will be enhanced through the linkage of a subset of Medicare data to electronic health records and a national survey to supplement clinical information, and external validation of the Medicare data analysis in 2 large commercial databases. In the next 4 years, the investigators will accomplish 3 specific aims: 1) evaluate the temporal trends and predictors of new CVD drug use in frail and non-frail older adults with CVD over 2011-2020; 2) determine disease-specific benefit (deaths, CVD and safety events) and net benefit (home time) of 6 new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies; 3) identify patient characteristics that can predict net benefit (home time) with new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies. This proposal's innovative approach, which combines near-real-time prospective monitor- ing, a claims-based frailty score, and the patient-centered outcome of home time, offers a readily scalable and feasible framework for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of newly approved medications. The impact of the proposed research is significant because timely evidence generated from real-world healthcare data can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new CVD drugs based on a patient's frailty and expected net benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to establish a prospective monitoring program for newly approved cardiovascular drugs for older adults with frailty in routine healthcare databases and identify predictors of benefit from the new drugs. This research is relevant to public health because the evidence generated from this work can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new cardiovascular drugs in older adults based on a patient's frailty level and expected net benefit. Thus, it accomplishes the National Institute on Aging's missions and initiatives by promoting effective and safe drug therapy in older adults.",Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty,9711825,R01AG062713,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enalapril', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frail Elderly', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neprilysin', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clopidogrel', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'frailty', 'head-to-head comparison', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'safety study', 'sex']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,783556,0.09704904465502896
"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9442890,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2018,794994,0.10791706918344743
"Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges ABSTRACT CVD disparities across the race/ethnic and socioeconomic gradients are exacerbated by barriers to receiving guideline-based primary or secondary preventive treatment—such as appropriate blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes treatment.1–6 Most patients not receiving guideline-based treatment are actually insured and have seen a primary care provider in the past year.1 To reduce CVD disparities by better targeting disease prevention and treatment, healthcare administrators and county departments of public health have begun pooling data resources across healthcare and public health systems—such as across clinics, emergency rooms and hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and administrative datasets.7–9 The idea behind pooling such datasets is to better identify persons most in need, and direct targeted interventions to them. Solano County, California, a medium-sized, diverse, low-income county, has developed one of the first, and most comprehensive health information exchanges (HIEs), including: (i) electronic health record data from all emergency rooms, hospitals, primary care and specialty clinics and care facilities in the county; (ii) labs from all laboratory service providers; (iii) prescription details from all pharmacies; (iv) validated social determinants of health surveys administered in clinics; and (v) administrative datasets, including welfare, disability, housing, and geocoded neighborhood features. While several other counties are following suit to develop large, secure HIEs across healthcare and public health systems, a key challenge remains: how to cheaply, accurately, and rapidly analyze HIEs to identify which persons should be targeted for interventions. Without reliable, user- friendly, cost-effective, and generalizable data analysis programs, counties are unable to use the massive data at their disposal to address preventable causes of morbidity and mortality. The objective of this application is to apply our unique machine-learning innovations to develop open-source programs that can enable counties to identify persons at high risk for preventable CVD events and deaths. We will test the hypothesis that electronic health record data alone are insufficient to provide accurate risk prediction for preventable CVD events and deaths. Rather, we believe that key survey and administrative data providing information on social determinants of health will improve identification of high-risk patients. To test our hypothesis, we will develop and validate open-source, generalizable programs to: (Aim 1) rapidly identify persons in need of improved primary and secondary prevention of CVD by systematically comparing the performance of three alternative machine learning approaches to read HIE data, as compared to human clinician chart reviewers; and (Aim 2) perform multi-level risk assessment by automatically calibrating and validating models of CVD event risk, utilization and cost to HIE data, to identify the added value of administrative and social determinants data as compared to clinical or claims-based data alone. Our work will produce generalizable software tools for counties across the country to analyze HIE data and reduce preventable CVD disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities are exacerbated by inadequate guideline-based treatment of CVD risk factors. Furthermore, risk adjustment models currently used to target interventions and pay for healthcare services only use claims-based data such as demographics and clinical diagnostic codes, ignoring social determinants of health. Our research will rigorously develop and test novel machine learning methods that incorporate social determinants data from large Health Information Exchanges, producing novel data tools that will enable health systems nationwide to better detect individuals who could use improvements in their preventive therapy for CVD, and improve risk adjustment models to identify persons at high risk for preventable healthcare utilization and cost.",Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges,9584874,R21MD012867,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Blood Pressure', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Models', 'Case Management', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Surveys', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Neighborhoods', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Primary Health Care', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Secure', 'Social Work', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Unemployment', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular disorder therapy', 'care providers', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disorder prevention', 'health care service', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'payment', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'residence', 'safety net', 'semiparametric', 'service providers', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'treatment disparity', 'user-friendly', 'welfare']",NIMHD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,229089,0.12318335857284961

He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data. In patients with diabetes at risk of cardiovascular disease events, I will examine the impact that missing data has on the ability to use the EHR for clinical research and develop approaches to address the biases resulting from missing data.",Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD,9598902,K01HL140146,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Baptist Church', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Privacy', 'Publishing', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'South Carolina', 'Stroke', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'care seeking', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'distributed data', 'electronic data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'practical application', 'professor', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'study population']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,166645,0.0495756790443429
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project focuses on human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife, with an emphasis on factors that moderate and mediate brain-to- risk relationships.

"Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Detrimental shifts in the resting (tonic) contributions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) to visceral functions throughout the body, a form of compromised allostasis, have been observed with both emotional dysregulation and disordered mood and may be a common, core vulnerability for CVD and metabolic syndrome. A crucial but understudied psychological vulnerability to compromised allostasis is low emotional granularity, or the inability to experience emotion with precision and detail (e.g., the inability to distinguish anger vs. frustration, or even anger vs. sadness). A critical barrier to ameliorating low granularity, and therefore reducing susceptibility to CVD and metabolic syndrome, has been the lack of a theoretical framework linking emotional granularity to physiological regulation, as well as tools for effectively measuring and improving granularity. Theoretical advances in affective science posit that the use of more precise emotion concepts is associated with a peripheral physiological system better able to respond to environmental perturbations (e.g., stressors). If low granularity results from impoverished emotion concepts, then the brain is less able to predict and categorize viscerosensory changes that arise from regulation of the body’s internal milieu. Increased parasympathetic tone at rest permits more efficient regulation by promoting recovery and energy conservation, and substantial evidence suggests that lowered risk profiles for CVD are associated with increased high frequency heart rate variability (HF HRV). The proposed research will use experience sampling and ambulatory monitoring data to map variability in emotional granularity in everyday life and examine its consequences for peripheral physiology, with a focus on resting HF HRV. In Aim 1, machine learning will be used to assess whether individuals lower in emotional granularity have less efficient allostasis, as reflected by both lower resting parasympathetic activity and fewer distinct patterns of ANS activity. In Aim 2, graph theory will be used to develop metrics for measuring temporal and contextual dynamics of emotional granularity, which provide meaningful variance necessary to describe patterns of subjective experience and physiological activity. Exploratory Aim 3 will assess whether in-lab emotion concept training can be used to improve granularity of emotion concepts, with the ultimate goal of developing longer-term training aimed at increasing physiological specificity and resting HF HRV. By integrating modeling from engineering and computer science to better capture idiographic variation in emotion, the proposed research offers an innovative approach for understanding how a psychological vulnerability could increase the risk for cardiovascular illness. The outcomes of this work will allow for the development of psychological interventions that can decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE A wide range of emotion-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome have been identified, yet little is known about how the underlying mechanisms that link emotion to physiological regulation of the body can be leveraged to reduce susceptibility. The proposed work addresses this critical barrier by examining how one psychological vulnerability is linked to parasympathetic activation, and can be more effectively measured in patterns of autonomic nervous system activity and subjective experience. By further identifying possible interventions that target this vulnerability, this work seeks to decrease risk for physical illness by increasing efficient allostasis and encouraging adaptive coping mechanisms.",Improving measurement of emotional granularity to investigate affective mechanisms of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome,9470193,F31HL140943,"['Address', 'Affective', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alexithymias', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Anger', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Behavioral', 'Binge Eating', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Common Core', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotional disorder', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'alcohol risk', 'allostasis', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computer science', 'contextual factors', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'disability', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional experience', 'experience', 'graph theory', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'psychologic', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,38124,0.013433633984718854
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort - Diversity Supplement Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes. The proposed training activities are designed to enhance the applicant's knowledge of epigenetics and physiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and to further his career as an independent investigator in the area of computational epigenetics for CVD.",Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data,9392931,K01HL124050,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training Activity', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'high dimensionality', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'member', 'multiple omics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'training opportunity', 'user friendly software', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2018,137512,0.02130433063543417
"Phamarcogenomics of Statin Therapy (SUPPLEMENT) PARENT ABSTRACT The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin-treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well- characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin- induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects 1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs. ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT ABSTRACT In response to NOT-AG-18-008, our goal is to extend the validation and application of our data integration methodologies into Alzheimer’s disease research. This administrative supplement is designed to extend the work of the existing subaward to the University of Pennsylvania subcontract for the POST Informatics Core. The PGRN POST Informatics Core serves as the central hub for data sharing and coordination across the three POST projects in the PGRN P50 award. One of our jobs is annotating the extensive information that will be collected and providing analysis expertise to the projects as needed. However, to make great strides in scientific progress and ensure that the collective whole of the Center is greater than the sum of the parts, a key function of the Informatics Core is to serve as ‘The Integrator’ to combine these data and information. We and others have shown that integration of complementary omics-based data can provide emergent insights into biological processes compared to what can be learned through any single approach alone. The methods that we are developing to integrate data for statin pharmacogenomic phenotypes will be equally applicable in the area of Alzheimer’s disease. Additionally, recent emphasis on open data science by Alzheimer’s disease researchers provides ample data for us to interrogate our method. We have developed novel statistical analysis tools such as the Analysis Tool for Heritable and Environmental Network Associations (ATHENA), and data visualization tools, such as PhenoGram, both of which are designed to collect and combine information from diverse data sources. With these tools, we will leverage publicly available Alzheimer’s disease datasets to maximize the knowledge gleaned about disease risk for Alzheimer’s diseases. The methodologies that we have been developing as part of the PGRN POST award for the past 2.5 years are clearly applicable to the study of Alzheimer’s disease risk. An important validation step of the application of our methodologies is to apply them to different types of datasets and in different phenotypic areas. This administrative supplement focused on extended research into having an Alzheimer’s disease focus is a great mechanism to simultaneously allow us to validate our methodologies with different types of data and potentially identify important risk factors and pathways toward a better understanding of the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates.

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions.

"Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in older adults. Statins are highly effective cholesterol-lowering medications used for primary prevention of CVD, and are the most commonly prescribed medications. After age 75, data on the effects of statins are limited to guide statin prescribing recommendations. However, even where the evidence is clear, statins remain under-prescribed. Reasons for under-prescribing of proven CVD prevention medications such as statins in older adults are many, and may include competing medical conditions, adverse side effects (e.g., myalgias), and frailty. Frailty is a multidimensional state of decreased physiologic reserve associated with an increased risk of CVD and poor clinical outcomes. The aging population is heterogeneous and a one-size fits all approach may not be appropriate. In particular, understanding the utility of statins for prevention of CVD in individuals who are vulnerable or frail is critical. Therefore, the research activities in this GEMSSTAR award will use a retrospective design to (1) understand patterns of statin use in a large cohort of older US veterans aged 65 and older, over 15 years of follow up, with particular attention to the relationship between frailty, myalgias and statin use; and (2) examine the association between statin use for primary prevention of CVD in pre-frail and frail older veterans and cardiovascular events, health care utilization, and mortality. This work will inform the design of future clinical trials of statins for prevention of CVD in older adults accounting for heterogeneity of aging and frailty. In addition to the pharmacoepidemiologic study proposed, this GEMSSTAR award includes mentorship, coursework, and seminars in advanced epidemiologic and statistical methods, geriatrics, and cardiology. The research and career development activities will prepare the applicant for her long-term goal of a research career in geriatric preventive cardiology and will inform preventive care for the aging population. As the population ages, identifying preventive strategies for heart disease and stroke is a priority. However, proven preventive medications such as the cholesterol-lowering statins remain underused. In this study, we aim to understand patterns of statin use in older adults to shed light on why statins may be underused even where evidence is clear, and to examine whether statins are useful in preventing heart disease and stroke in older adults who are vulnerable or frail.","Frailty, Statins, and Cardiovascular Disease Burden in Older Adults",9589859,R03AG060169,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Event', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Medical', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myalgia', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive therapy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Smoking Status', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'aged', 'aging population', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'male', 'mortality', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'prevent', 'research and development', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R03,2018,96525,0.11942853043687954
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9309793,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'glutaryl coA', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,406123,0.12320791720860534
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes.

"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes. The proposed training activities are designed to enhance the applicant's knowledge of epigenetics and physiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and to further his career as an independent investigator in the area of computational epigenetics for CVD.",Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data,9032704,K01HL124050,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Histones', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training Activity', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'genetic risk factor', 'improved', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Expression', 'member', 'multiple omics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'training opportunity', 'user friendly software', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2016,142841,0.02130433063543417
"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of the Center ""Pharmacogenomics of Statin Therapy"" (POST) is to apply genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses, together with studies in cellular and animal models, and innovative informatic tools, to identify and validate biomarkers for efficacy of statin drugs in reducing riskof cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for adverse effects of statins, specifically myopathy and type 2 diabetes. This multidisciplinary approach is enabled by a team of investigators with expertise in genomics (human, mouse, and molecular), statistics and informatics, and clinical medicine and pharmacology. The Center is comprised of three Projects, two Research Cores, and an Administrative Core. A major aim of Project 1 is the identification of cellular transcriptomic and metabolomic markers for clinical efficacy and adverse effects of statins. This will be accomplished by analyses in statin-exposed lymphoblast cell lines derived from patients with major adverse coronary events, or onset of myopathy or type 2 diabetes on statin treatment, compared with unaffected statin- treated controls. In addition, using genome wide genotypes from these patients, DNA variants will be identified that are associated with statin-induced changes in the transcripts and metabolites that most strongly discriminate affected patients and controls. Project 2 will use a unique, well-characterized panel of 100 inbred mouse strains to discover genetic variation associated with statin-induced myopathy and dysglycemia. Mechanisms underlying these effects will be investigated, with emphasis on the role of dysregulation of autophagy by statin treatment. Projects 1 and 2 will also use relevant cellular and mouse models, respectively, to perform functional studies to validate effects of genes identified in all POST projects as strong candidates for modulating statin efficacy or adverse effects. In Project 3, information derived from genome-wide genotypes, electronic health records, and pharmacy data in a very large and diverse population-based patient cohort will be leveraged to identify and replicate genetic associations with statin efficacy (lipid lowering and CVD event reduction) and adverse effects (myopathy and type 2 diabetes), as well as to assess the overall heritability of these responses. The Clinical Core, based in Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, will provide the clinical information and biologic materials for both Projects1 and 3. Investigators in the Informatics Core will optimize data analysis and integration of results across all projects. The Administrative Core will provide scientific leadership and management of the Center, and foster scientific interactions and training opportunities. Overall, the research program of this Center provides an innovative model for a ""systems"" approach to pharmacogenomics that incorporates complementary investigative tools to discover and validate genetically influenced determinants of drug response. Moreover, the findings have the potential for guiding more effective use of statins for reducing CVD risk and minimizing adverse effects, and identifying biomarkers of pathways that modulate the multiple actions of this widely used class of drugs.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Coronary heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States, and statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs to prevent these conditions.

"Methods for high-dimensional data in HIV/CVD research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have yielded vast quantities of molecular and cellular data, affording unprecedented opportunities to understand complex disease etiologies and to inform clinical management strategies. However, in order to derive information from these rich stores of data we need to develop sound and appropriate analytic techniques. This need is especially relevant in studies at the intersection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are characterized by an elaborate set of interactions among viral and host factors. These factors include viral and host genetic profiles, as well as markers of caloric metabolism, immune activation and inflammation, which work together to determine response to therapy and overall disease progression. A comprehensive assessment of these markers presents several analytical challenges owing to the large number of potentially informative variables and the largely uncharacterized relationship among them. We propose a multi-faceted strategy that focuses on the development and application of integrative statistical approaches. Such approaches will allow us to explore and characterize novel hypotheses relating to the complex relationships among multiple genetic, environmental, demographic, and clinical factors and measures of disease progression. Specifically, this continuation application focuses on advancing and applying statistical methods in two settings: first, we consider population-based genetic association studies of innate-immunity, adipokine, drug metabolism and drug transport genes and markers of immune reconstitution, inflammation and risk of CVD in HIV-infected individuals; and second, we address investigations of metabolic and immunologic profiles that associate with immune recovery, inflammation and risk of CVD. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to develop and evaluate: (1) Latent class and mixture modeling paradigms for (a) discovering and characterizing multi-locus genotype-trait associations and (b) evaluating unobservable haplotype-trait associations in candidate-gene investigations; and (2) Hierarchical mixture models and machine learning approaches for (a) monitoring quantitative biomarkers in resource-limited settings and (b) characterizing high- dimensional predictors of immune reconstitution and inflammation. IMPACT: This research will lead to the creation of appropriate and carefully evaluated analytic tools to derive information from the rich array of molecular and cellular data now available. Ultimately, this research will advance our ability to translate molecular and cellular level data for clinical decision making, serving at the cornerstone of personalized medicine. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The newly available array of data on genetic polymorphisms and cellular level immune factors promises unprecedented opportunities to elucidate complex disease etiology and inform clinical management strategies. Using human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) as our model systems, we propose to develop, evaluate and apply new analytic approaches for high-dimensional data.

"Statin Use and Efficacy Among HIV-Infected Patients by Cholesterol Risk Category DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected patients are thought to be an at-risk group for elevated rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), yet it is not known whether traditional cardiovascular preventative guidelines are applicable to this group. Specifically, it has not been determined whether treatment with statins reduces risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for HIV-infected patients and whether criteria for statin use should be determined based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATPIII) guidelines for management of dyslipidemia, which were developed for use in general populations. Data indicate that the mechanism of CVD in HIV populations may differ from the general population and may be driven in large part by HIV-associated inflammatory and immunologic changes, suggesting that strategies for cardiovascular prevention may differ as well. In the proposed study, we will assess the applicability of the NCEP ATPIII guidelines to HIV populations. Aim 1 will involve ascertaining whether statins are prescribed according to criteria for use, determining rates of statin use in HIV and matched control patients according to whether patients had attained their LDL goal prior to statin initiation. In Aim 2, we will investigate the association o statin therapy with incident AMI among HIV-infected patients, answering the question of whether AMI risk reduction with statins differs based on whether patients had met criteria for statin use prior to drug initiation. The finding we anticipate - that statins reduce cardiovascular risk even n HIV-infected patients who do not meet conventional criteria for use - would indicate that HIV-infected patients merit different and tailored criteria for statin use. The research design will harness the power of a large health care system-based data registry with infrastructure already tailored to assess specific CVD-related and HIV-related variables in HIV and matched control patients, thereby offering an innovative and efficient approach to answer the research questions. Advanced analytic techniques, including natural language processing tools and propensity score analysis, will be employed to enable the most rigorous observational data study. Moreover, the anticipated update of the NCEP guidelines provides a potential opportunity to assess our study hypotheses using the most up-to date recommendations for the general population. The proposed study will leverage existing data to advance the field of cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention in an at-risk subgroup, answering the following key and previously unanswered question: Should HIV providers prescribe statins to patients using the same criteria as for the general population? As the first study assessing cardiovascular risk reduction with statins among HIV-infected patients, the data will fill a critical knowledge gap, providing knowledge on the applicability of standard cardiovascular preventative guidelines for HIV populations and impacting the development of HIV-specific criteria for statin use through clinical trials. The findings will have broad relevance to both HIV clinical care paradigms and to cardiovascular risk reduction for at-risk populations with novel risk factors for CVD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, but optimal preventative strategies are unknown. Specifically, it is not known whether current guidelines used to the general population are applicable to HIV-infected patients with respect to criteria to use statins, widely used lipid-lowering medications which have been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease in the general population. The current study will determine rates of statin use and whether statin use is associated with a decreased risk of heart attack in an HIV patient group, according to whether patient met criteria for statin use. The findings will help to develop strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease among HIV-infected patients.",Statin Use and Efficacy Among HIV-Infected Patients by Cholesterol Risk Category,8789172,R21HL122138,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Immunologics', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2015,128542,0.09999694714300038

"Statin Use and Efficacy Among HIV-Infected Patients by Cholesterol Risk Category     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV-infected patients are thought to be an at-risk group for elevated rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), yet it is not known whether traditional cardiovascular preventative guidelines are applicable to this group. Specifically, it has not been determined whether treatment with statins reduces risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) for HIV-infected patients and whether criteria for statin use should be determined based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATPIII) guidelines for management of dyslipidemia, which were developed for use in general populations. Data indicate that the mechanism of CVD in HIV populations may differ from the general population and may be driven in large part by HIV-associated inflammatory and immunologic changes, suggesting that strategies for cardiovascular prevention may differ as well. In the proposed study, we will assess the applicability of the NCEP ATPIII guidelines to HIV populations. Aim 1 will involve ascertaining whether statins are prescribed according to criteria for use, determining rates of statin use in HIV and matched control patients according to whether patients had attained their LDL goal prior to statin initiation. In Aim 2, we will investigate the association o statin therapy with incident AMI among HIV-infected patients, answering the question of whether AMI risk reduction with statins differs based on whether patients had met criteria for statin use prior to drug initiation. The finding we anticipate - that statins reduce cardiovascular risk even n HIV-infected patients who do not meet conventional criteria for use - would indicate that HIV-infected patients merit different and tailored criteria for statin use. The research design will harness the power of a large health care system-based data registry with infrastructure already tailored to assess specific CVD-related and HIV-related variables in HIV and matched control patients, thereby offering an innovative and efficient approach to answer the research questions. Advanced analytic techniques, including natural language processing tools and propensity score analysis, will be employed to enable the most rigorous observational data study. Moreover, the anticipated update of the NCEP guidelines provides a potential opportunity to assess our study hypotheses using the most up-to date recommendations for the general population. The proposed study will leverage existing data to advance the field of cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention in an at-risk subgroup, answering the following key and previously unanswered question: Should HIV providers prescribe statins to patients using the same criteria as for the general population? As the first study assessing cardiovascular risk reduction with statins among HIV-infected patients, the data will fill a critical knowledge gap, providing knowledge on the applicability of standard cardiovascular preventative guidelines for HIV populations and impacting the development of HIV-specific criteria for statin use through clinical trials. The findings will have broad relevance to both HIV clinical care paradigms and to cardiovascular risk reduction for at-risk populations with novel risk factors for CVD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: HIV-infected patients are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, but optimal preventative strategies are unknown. Specifically, it is not known whether current guidelines used to the general population are applicable to HIV-infected patients with respect to criteria to use statins, widely used lipid-lowering medications which have been shown to prevent cardiovascular disease in the general population. The current study will determine rates of statin use and whether statin use is associated with a decreased risk of heart attack in an HIV patient group, according to whether patient met criteria for statin use. The findings will help to develop strategies to prevent cardiovascular disease among HIV-infected patients.            ",Statin Use and Efficacy Among HIV-Infected Patients by Cholesterol Risk Category,8659563,R21HL122138,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Immunologics', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care delivery', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'population based', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R21,2014,130500,0.09999694714300038

The CVRG will provide the national cardiovascular research community a collaborative environment for discovering, representing, federating, sharing and analyzing multi-scale cardiovascular data, thus enabling interdisciplinary research directed at identifying features in these data that are predictive of disease risk, treatment and outcome. In this proposal, we present a plan for development of the CVRG. Goals are: To develop the Cardiovascular Data Repository (CDR). The CDR will be a software package that can be downloaded and installed locally. It will provide the grid-enabled software components needed to manage transcriptional, proteomic, imaging and electrophysiological (referred to as ""multi-scale"") cardiovascular data. It will include the software components needed for linking CDR nodes together to extend the CVRG To make available, through community access to and use of the CVRG, anonymized cardiovascular data sets supporting collaborative cardiovascular research on a national and international scale To develop Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) by which new grid-enabled software components, such as data analysis tools and databases, may be deployed on the CVRG To: a) develop novel algorithms for parametric characterization of differences in ventricular shape and motion in health versus disease using MR and CT imaging data; b) develop robust, readily interpretable statistical learning methods for discovering features in multi-scale cardiovascular data that are predictive of disease risk, treatment and outcome; and c) deploy these algorithms on the CVRG via researcher-friendly web-portals for use by the cardiovascular research community To set in place effective Resource administrative policies for managing project development, for assuring broad dissemination and support of all Resource software and to establish CVRG Working Groups as a means for interacting with and responding to the data management and analysis needs of the cardiovascular research community and for growing the set of research organizations managing nodes of the CVRG.

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. The results, together with the computer programs and ancillary databases will make a significant contribution to many ongoing and new genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related diseases.             n/a",VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,7895861,R01HL091028,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chromosomes', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exclusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophy', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Sea', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'Weight', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'heuristics', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'mortality', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait', 'web site']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,228000,0.1626126734127187
"DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ONTOLOGIES FOR INTEGRATING MULTI-CENTER CARDIOVASCULAR STUDIE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia constitute a major public-health burden due to increased mortality and morbidity and rising health care costs. Massive epidemiological data are needed to detect the small effects of many individual genes and the environment on these traits. However, sample sizes needed to make powerful inferences may only be reached by integrating multiple epidemiological studies. Meaningful integration of information from multiple studies requires the development of data ontologies which make it possible to integrate information across studies in an optimum manner so as to maximize the information content and hence the statistical power for detecting small effect sizes. A second compounding problem of data integration is that software applications that manage such study data are typically non-interoperable, i.e. “silos” of data, and are incapable of being shared in a syntactically and semantically meaningful manner. Consequently, an infrastructure that integrates across studies in an interoperable manner is needed to ensure that epidemiological cardiovascular research remains a viable and major player in the biomedical informatics revolution which is currently underway. The cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIGTM) is addressing these problems in the cancer domain by developing software systems that are able to exchange information or that are syntactically interoperable by accessing metadata that is semantically annotated using controlled vocabularies. Our overarching goal is to develop ontologies for integrating cardiovascular epidemiological data from multiple studies. Specifically, we propose three Aims: First, develop cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies for each of three disparate multi-center epidemiological studies that facilitate data integration across the studies and data mining for various phenotypes. Second, adopt a technology infrastructure that leverages the cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies using Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and caBIGTM tools to facilitate the integration and widespread sharing of cardiovascular data sets. Third, facilitate seamless data sharing and promote widespread data dissemination among research communities cutting across clinical, translational and epidemiological domains, primarily through collaboration with the established CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity which contributes substantially to rising health care costs and consequently constitutes a major public health burden. Therefore, understanding the genetic and environmental effects on these CVD traits is important. Massive epidemiological study data are needed to detect the small individual effects of genes and their interactions, and integration of multiple epidemiological studies are necessary for generating large sample sizes.

"Computational system to predict novel genetic disease associations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): High-throughput genotyping, expression, and sequencing technologies and the development of increasingly sophisticated methods for predicting gene-disease interactions have given the new field of genomic-based personalized medicine a wealth of data: more, in fact, than can easily be processed and interpreted. Omicia is in the business of developing computational tools and diagnostics in the field of personalized medicine for cardiovascular disease (CVD). As part of that effort we are developing a software infrastructure that uses these abundant data to identify and prioritize candidate genes and their sequence variations for clinical evaluation. The research proposed in this application has three aims. In Phase II, we will enhance and optimize Omicia's Gene Inference System (GIS), prototyped during the SBIR Phase I project. In Phase II we will add additional capabilities to its candidate gene identification methods. This will build upon the Omicia Disease Genes (ODG) ontology built in Phase I, and add pathway and protein-interaction data and include ""top"" candidates from external publicaly-available clinical studies. In Aim 2, we will enhance the ability of GIS to prioritize sequence variations by improving our novel paralogous-gene variation identification algorithm (iDIP) and by integrating existing amino-acid substitution (AAS) methods. By running these algorithms over all known human genes via dbSNP, we expect to identify a list of candidate variations that will be evaluated in Aim 3 including an in vitro experiment. The goal of Aim 3 is to test the gene- and variant-predictive power of GIS and to compare it to other selection methods. The clinical study will be a single-stage case control design to test the ""top"" variant candidates from Aims 1 & 2 and compare the potential association to well-established genetic markers for the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). With approximately 700 cases and 700 matched controls, our association study will be well powered to test our predicted functional markers for MI. The GIS infrastructure is an integral part of the commercial workflow of Omicia, and will form the basis of the product pipeline. As such, it will serve as licensable commercial technology for the company by helping other biotechnology companies to develop their genetic biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic developments (theranostics). In addition, any novel variants drawn from this Phase II study will be licensable and exploitable intellectual property, useful both as the basis for future products in our internal pipeline, as well as potentially valuable additions to our patent portfolio. The Phase II goals of enhancing and clinically validating GIS serve three purposes: proving our methodology as applied to CVD and opening the door to applications in other disease areas; showcasing GIS as a key technology for managing complexity in the post-genomic era and providing clinically-relevant insights; and finally, potentially identifying valuable IP in the form of novel genetic markers for MI.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The outcome of this project will be an evaluated gene inference system (GIS) for identifying gene-disease interactions, with a focus in the area of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.

"DEVELOPMENT OF DATA ONTOLOGIES FOR INTEGRATING MULTI-CENTER CARDIOVASCULAR STUDIE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia constitute a major public-health burden due to increased mortality and morbidity and rising health care costs. Massive epidemiological data are needed to detect the small effects of many individual genes and the environment on these traits. However, sample sizes needed to make powerful inferences may only be reached by integrating multiple epidemiological studies. Meaningful integration of information from multiple studies requires the development of data ontologies which make it possible to integrate information across studies in an optimum manner so as to maximize the information content and hence the statistical power for detecting small effect sizes. A second compounding problem of data integration is that software applications that manage such study data are typically non-interoperable, i.e. “silos” of data, and are incapable of being shared in a syntactically and semantically meaningful manner. Consequently, an infrastructure that integrates across studies in an interoperable manner is needed to ensure that epidemiological cardiovascular research remains a viable and major player in the biomedical informatics revolution which is currently underway. The cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIGTM) is addressing these problems in the cancer domain by developing software systems that are able to exchange information or that are syntactically interoperable by accessing metadata that is semantically annotated using controlled vocabularies. Our overarching goal is to develop ontologies for integrating cardiovascular epidemiological data from multiple studies. Specifically, we propose three Aims: First, develop cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies for each of three disparate multi-center epidemiological studies that facilitate data integration across the studies and data mining for various phenotypes. Second, adopt a technology infrastructure that leverages the cardiovascular data ontologies and vocabularies using Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and caBIGTM tools to facilitate the integration and widespread sharing of cardiovascular data sets. Third, facilitate seamless data sharing and promote widespread data dissemination among research communities cutting across clinical, translational and epidemiological domains, primarily through collaboration with the established CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG). Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity which contributes substantially to rising health care costs and consequently constitutes a major public health burden. Therefore, understanding the genetic and environmental effects on these CVD traits is important. Massive epidemiological study data are needed to detect the small individual effects of genes and their interactions, and integration of multiple epidemiological studies are necessary for generating large sample sizes. Unfortunately, integrating information from multiple studies in a meaningful manner requires the development of data ontologies (language and grammar).

"VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) affect millions of people in US and across the world. There is strong evidence of a genetic component in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and related traits. An emerging consensus is that both genes and environment and, perhaps more importantly, their interactions are responsible for this complex disease. As a result, many genetic epidemiological (GE) studies of CVD use a study design that tests hundreds of thousands of genetic predictors (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers) and hundreds of (related) disease phenotypes and environmental covariates. This has brought tremendous analytical challenges, particularly the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables. As a result, searching for CVD disease genes has become a task of selecting important variables from a vast number of SNPs and other predictor variables. Our real data analyses in several ongoing large scale CVD related studies motivated us to consider new methodological solutions to the variable selection problem. This application is developed upon these positive preliminary findings. Our main idea is to develop a strategy for selecting important predictors of CVD by integrating multiple sources of information via the method of statistical learning (i.e., optimizing the selection by repeated learning from examples). In this strategy, we will first develop a method for selecting significant SNPs in moderate-dimensional data (e.g., lower thousands of SNPs, in candidate genes studies) by an integrated classifier. The method will build upon existing techniques assessing information of SNPs in haplotype similarity, imputed functional potential, and gene-gene interactions. We then scale up the new method to the high-dimensional setting of genome-wide association studies (e.g., at least hundreds of thousands of SNPs), by dimension reduction that utilizes the local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) structure in SNPs and by combining latent factor analysis of correlated CVD traits and pathway-based analysis to account for gene-environment (GxE) interactions. A fast-search algorithm will also be developed based on an existing search heuristic that was successfully applied in high-dimensional data of gene expression and genomic sequence analysis. The new methods and algorithms will be coded into R programs and distributed as tool set for an association analysis pipeline. Evaluations of the new methods will be performed by intensive simulation studies and by applying to existing datasets in ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. Results from evaluation studies, together with the ancillary databases generated by the study such as imputed functional scores of potential or known CVD SNPs will be distributed on a dedicated project website. By doing so, we believe that the utilities resulted from the proposed research will make a significant contribution to many ongoing genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related traits.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project is aimed at timely development of computational tools for emerging large-scale genome-wide association studies of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) that affect millions of people in US and across the world. The new methods deal with the analytical challenges brought forth by the high dimensionality of the data and the obscure interactions among the many variables in these studies, and the tools will be applied to ongoing studies of CVD and related diseases. The results, together with the computer programs and ancillary databases will make a significant contribution to many ongoing and new genetic epidemiological studies of CVD and related diseases.             n/a",VARIABLE SELECTION IN GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,7528626,R01HL091028,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chromosomes', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Exclusion', 'Factor Analysis', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heart failure', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophy', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Score', 'Sea', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Statistical Computing', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'gene interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'heuristics', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'programs', 'scale up', 'simulation', 'tool', 'trait', 'ventricular hypertrophy']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,228000,0.1626126734127187

"Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health PROJECT SUMMARY Over 80% of the US population resides in urban areas, and the built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may drive cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain, and by influencing exposures to environmental factors, such as air pollution, extreme temperatures, and noise. Evidence for the built environment and CVD has been dominated by cross-sectional studies with nonspecific exposure assessment. Developing precise, time-varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to establish causal relationships between the built environment and CVD, which are crucial to informing policy-relevant, actionable interventions. It is now possible to estimate such exposure metrics at scale in prospective cohort studies using deep learning computer vision methods, a class of machine learning algorithms that can accurately process images, combined with time-varying nationwide street-level imagery, high resolution satellite data, and novel mobile health technologies. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing built environment exposure measures from deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data in participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (N=500), and to geocoded residential addresses from nationwide Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts (N=288,000). We will create built environment exposure measures by leveraging deep learning algorithms applied to nationwide Google Street View imagery (2007-2020) and high-resolution Landsat satellite data (1986-2020) to create fine-scale, time-varying built environment metrics of the natural environment (e.g., trees), physical environment (e.g., sidewalks), perceptions (e.g., safety), and urban form (e.g., compact high-rise). We will use a mix of innovative analytical approaches to determine the effect of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence across different time horizons. First, we will append these metrics to time-activity patterns of participants who have collected minute-level data on GPS and physical activity from smartphones and consumer wearable devices to quantify how minute-level exposure to the built environment is related to CVD health behaviors. Next, we will apply novel built environment metrics to residential address histories of participants to estimate how self-reported CVD health behaviors change after their residential built environment changes. Last, we will examine the association between long-term cumulative residential exposure to the built environment and CVD incidence over 34 years of follow-up. Our work will enable us to measure built environment exposure from unprecedented perspectives in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential causal relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, and to better specify pathways to CVD incidence. Ultimately, our work will yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health. PROJECT NARRATIVE The built environment—the buildings, streets, and green spaces in which we live—may influence cardiovascular disease (CVD) by promoting or limiting physical activity and weight gain and by shaping exposures to environmental hazards (e.g., air pollution, extreme temperatures, noise); however, developing accurate, time- varying, and personalized exposure metrics is necessary to build causal relationships between the built environment and CVD and to inform policy-relevant, actionable interventions. We propose to identify the influence of the built environment on CVD-related health behaviors and CVD incidence by developing longitudinal built environment exposure measures from street-view and satellite imagery using deep learning algorithms, and to apply these exposure measures to time-activity data from a) 500 participants with global positioning systems (GPS) data from the Nurses’ Health Study 3 (NHS3) and b) over 34 years of geocoded residential addresses from three large nationwide cohorts of over 288,000 US adult women and men from the Nurses’ Health Study, Nurses’ Health Study II, and Health Professionals Follow-up Study prospective cohorts. Our work will enable us to measure time-varying exposure to the built environment with unprecedented precision in large prospective cohorts, to elucidate potential relationships between the built environment and CVD health behaviors, to better specify pathways to CVD incidence, and ultimately, to yield actionable insights to guide land use policy and urban planning strategies to design cities that optimize cardiovascular health.",Built Environment Assessment through Computer visiON (BEACON): Applying Deep Learning to Street-Level and Satellite Images to Estimate Built Environment Effects on Cardiovascular Health,10050816,R01HL150119,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Air Pollution', 'Ancillary Study', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Global Positioning System', 'Green space', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Noise', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Planet Earth', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'built environment', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'experience', 'extreme temperature', 'follow-up', 'innovation', 'insight', 'land use', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'novel', 'petabyte', 'spatiotemporal', 'urban area', 'urban planning', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"HARVARD PILGRIM HEALTH CARE, INC.",R01,2020,863771,0.094499667840427
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9851429,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'structured data', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'treatment guidelines', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,172001,0.15930996426430577
"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest machine learning algorithm (MLA) to predict risk of uncontrolled blood pressure among adults with hypertension. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled blood pressure into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients.

"Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States for both men and women in every racial/ethnic group. Thus, accurate and systematic evaluation of CVD risk represents an aspect of Precision Medicine that will touch every patient. CVD risk scores that are currently the standard of care are derived from research cohorts and are particularly inaccurate in women, older patients, and those with missing data. The goal of this Precision Medicine based application is to capitalize on the depth and breadth of clinical data within electronic health record (EHR) systems to revolutionize CVD risk prediction, thereby optimizing personalized care for every patient. Our proposed approach is innovative in that we have identified and addressed the most significant barriers to development of an EHR-based risk score. Novel aspects of this research include: 1) use of complete EHR data to develop and validate algorithms to define a variety of risk factors (e.g., reproductive history), thus building a comprehensive risk profile for each patient that incorporates diagnosis and procedure codes, laboratory values, clinical test results, patient provided information (e.g., alcohol use), and natural language processing of unstructured clinical text; 2) incorporation of age at onset of risk factors; 3) use of highly flexible machine learning techniques in the form of generalized boosted regression modeling; 4) exploration of a new deep learning model for censored EHR data; and 5) determination of the extent of risk reclassification in multiple geographically-defined populations, including an underserved minority population. Furthermore, genetic studies demonstrate that incorporating variants into current risk models improves risk prediction and use of an individual's genetic risk could further enhance our ability to deliver precision medicine to every patient. Therefore, we seek to develop a sex-specific next-generation CVD risk prediction score using EHR data in combination with genetic variants. This paradigm is a significant departure from the current one that relies on scores derived from relatively small research cohorts that use only a restricted set of clinical parameters that differentially misclassify an individual's risk, especially in women. Our access to empirical clinical EHR data for hundreds of thousands of patients uniquely positions us to 1) develop a sex-specific risk prediction model for incident CVD using data from the EHR; 2) assess the performance of the sex-specific EHR risk score in an independent non-urban and rural population; and 3) identify and characterize patients for whom genetic information improves CVD prediction beyond the clinical risk score. Successful completion of these aims has the potential to impact all adult patients, drive clinical practice changes to systematically collect sex-specific risk factors, and inform attempts to embed the next-generation CVD risk score into EHR systems for automated use in clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single largest killer in the United States. We propose to use electronic health record data to improve our ability to accurately classify risk and identify those who would benefit from preventive therapies. Improved risk prediction will shed light on the mechanisms of CVD and potentially reduce incidence, save lives, and lower health care costs.",Harnessing the Electronic Health Record to Predict Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,9838270,R01HL136659,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Community Hospitals', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hybrids', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Preventive therapy', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Rural Population', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Touch sensation', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'feature extraction', 'flexibility', 'genetic information', 'genetic panel test', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'multiple data types', 'next generation', 'novel', 'older patient', 'personalized care', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'research clinical testing', 'risk prediction model', 'sex', 'standard of care', 'time use', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2020,794994,0.10791706918344743
"Effects of Chronic Kidney Disease on Cardiovascular Disease and Dementia Among People with Diabetes: Causal Modeling with Machine Learning Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetes has been the major public health issues imposing substantial health and economic burden on individuals and society. Given the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in which United Nations has resolved to reduce morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases by one-third by year 2030, understanding the major risk factors of long-term adverse health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) among patients with diabetes are imperative. While chronic kidney disease (CKD) and depression are closely interrelated with both diabetes and CVD, the causal link between these non-communicable diseases have not been sufficiently established. This is possibly due to (1) ill-defined temporality (i.e. unclear time- ordering of disease occurrence) and (2) their complex multifactorial and high-dimensional interaction with potential confounders such as demographic characteristics, socio-economic status, and comorbidities. The overall objective of this application is to investigate the causal relationship between diabetes and its complications including CKD. My specific aims are as follows: Aim 1 (F99 phase) assesses the causal relationship between depression and CVD among people with diabetes. After summarizing the previous literature, I will utilize longitudinal data to examine the joint effect of diabetes and depression on CVD sufficiently considering time-dependent exposure and confounders. Aim 2 (K00 phase) examines the causal pathway from diabetes to CKD, and to CVD mortality. I will develop the machine learning-based prediction model of CKD among people with diabetes, and then estimate the effect of CKD on CVD mortality using the obtained prediction model within causal inference structure. I will also investigate the extent to which CKD mediates the pathway from diabetes to CVD mortality. This study presents a timely opportunity to contribute to growing literature on how these non-communicable diseases (i.e. diabetes, depression, CKD, and CVD) interact with each other. Moreover, applications of machine learning in causal inference structure will contribute to the “precision health” concept by targeting high-risk populations and design effective interventions to prevent future non-communicable diseases and their complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes, depression, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and Cardiovascular disease (CVD) are major health concerns imposing substantial health and economic burden on individuals and society. This study proposes to estimate the effects of depression on CVD events among people with diabetes (F99 phase) and investigate the causal relationship between diabetes, CKD, and CVD mortality using machine learning within the causal inference structure (K00 phase). This project will provide research and training, contributing a much-needed analysis of diabetes and CKD on long-term adverse health outcomes as well as helping me develop into an independent researcher with expertise in diabetic kidney disease epidemiology.",Effects of Chronic Kidney Disease on Cardiovascular Disease and Dementia Among People with Diabetes: Causal Modeling with Machine Learning Approach,10059131,F99DK126119,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Economic Burden', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Factors', 'Scoring Method', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sustainable Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Nations', 'United States', 'Update', 'Weight', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'causal model', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'diet and exercise', 'effective intervention', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'successful intervention', 'therapy development']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F99,2020,34360,0.11639307632943693
"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, and policy implications regarding women's health, and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP),10051711,R01HL150065,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Life', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New Jersey', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'acute care', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'infant death', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'obstetrical complication', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'premature', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'stillbirth', 'support vector machine']",NHLBI,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2020,707286,0.04277599450690653
"Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension. Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. The primary modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension (HTN), which is exacerbated by high sodium intake. One third of Americans are hypertensive, of which half exhibit salt-sensitive HTN. Additionally, 12% of HTN patients do not respond to treatment using standard medications. Taken together, these statistics highlight the critical need to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of HTN for the design of alternative treatment options. The gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases including HTN. This project is designed to identify HTN- exacerbating or protective bacteria and their associated metabolic genes to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics for the treatment of HTN. Our preliminary results demonstrate that severe HTN induced by salt consumption correlates with shifts in the gut microbial community of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Therefore, we tested the potential for the gut microbiota to affect HTN by performing a fecal material transfer (FMT) from hypertensive Dahl SS into HTN-resistant rats. We demonstrated that the microbiome was sufficient to exacerbate HTN in recipients and corresponded with statistically significant shifts in the gut microbiome. These results lead us to hypothesize that the gut microbiota directly influences HTN. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of bacterial supplementation during onset of HTN in the Dahl SS rat model. Predetermined strains identified from our preliminary experiments will be grown in vitro and transferred into SS Dahl rats and the effect on blood pressure and kidney damage will be evaluated. Potential mechanisms through which the bacteria influence the severity of HTN will be explored by measuring metabolite production, evaluating gut barrier function, and identifying shifts in the gut microbiome. Aim 2 will utilize machine learning to identify specific gut bacteria and metabolic genes that serve as signatures for the severity of HTN. Experiments in this aim will exploit shotgun metagenomic sequencing and computational approaches to identify specific bacteria and metabolic genes associated with HTN. Their use as predictive biomarkers for HTN will be validated by PCR-based analysis. This work will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology (M&I) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the proposed aims. The Department of M&I offers a state-of-the-art educational program and various opportunities to explore alternative career pathways. We have designed a complementary training plan for my scientific and professional growth that will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. In all, this project is critical for my advancement as a Latina woman in biomedical research, the field of HTN research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for CVD. Project Narrative Hypertension (HTN) is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death world-wide. While the gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases, a mechanism by which the microbiota influence HTN remain unknown. This project is designed to identify specific bacteria, metabolic genes, and potential mechanisms by which the microbiota influence HTN.

"Searching for missing heritability for cardiometabolic outcomes by race ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are common global health conditions that carry a great public health burden for chronic disability and early death. African Americans are more likely to be disproportionately affected than Whites. Our proposed project will have an important impact because it has great potential to explain, 1) A measure of the genetic susceptibility of these cardiometabolic diseases and mortality, and 2) Interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score (GRS) with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these adverse health outcomes. There are published reports of interaction (effect modification) but not mediation (indirectly through an intervening variable) of a GRS with nutritional factors and low physical activity levels on cardiometabolic conditions; however, these studies involving interaction were performed predominantly in Whites. Most of the genetic susceptibility for these outcomes remains unexplained for African Americans. Studies are lacking on the role of these lifestyle factors in terms of interaction and especially mediation with a GRS to increase risk for cardiometabolic outcomes among Whites and African Americans. Thus, several questions remain regarding the influence environmental factors have with genes to increase disease risk and mortality among different race/ethnic groups. To address our questions, we will use the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Candidate Gene Association Resource dataset of about 50,000 subjects, including 13,000 African Americans. To account for a measure of the genetic susceptibility, we will capture multiplicative single nucleotide polymorphism effects by the re-weighted random forest statistical method to compute a disease-and-race-specific GRS. We will include functional reduction- oxidation and metabolic disruptive single nucleotide polymorphisms that are involved in the inflammation and nutrient-signaling pathways. We will then investigate interaction and mediation of a GRS with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on T2DM, CVD, and mortality at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis. Our data include information on genetic polymorphisms, cross-sectional and longitudinal measurements on phenotypes for T2DM, CVD, and mortality, as well as dietary intake, physical activity, and relevant covariates. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the study is to find a measure of the genetic susceptibility for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in Whites and especially African Americans. Our study will examine interaction and mediation of a genetic risk score with a low diet quality score and low physical activity levels on these cardiometabolic outcomes at baseline and over time by performing a meta-analysis.

"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans.

"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,9911103,F31HL151178,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Smoking Status', 'Social Identification', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'age group', 'base', 'biracial', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'cohort', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'good diet', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'racial difference', 'racial diversity', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'training opportunity', 'young adult']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2020,40733,0.0677153255525286
"Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort Statins among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Pleiotropic effects are unanticipated outcomes other than those for which the drug was originally developed, either therapeutic (beneficial) or detrimental (adverse drug reactions). Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad, including increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cataract, decreasing cancer-related mortality, and reducing dementia. Many effects are still not determined. In addition, individual responses to statins are highly variable. Genetics studies have identified loci that are significantly associated with statin response. However, it is unclear if either of the genetic variants within these regions is also associated with statin pleiotropic effects. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2.5 million individuals at Vanderbilt, including >110,000 statin exposure individuals. By linking this cohort to BioVU, the Vanderbilt de-identified DNA biobank, >10,000 of these statin exposure individuals have extant genome-wide genotyping. We argue that 1) previous inconclusive results are largely caused by inconsistent phenotype definitions, and 2) using the EHR to develop a novel, drug-based phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) provides an ideal approach to discover unknown statin effects. The still-growing Vanderbilt de-identified EHRs allow large amounts of individuals' clinical data shared to support validation of known pleiotropic effects and to enable novel discoveries. Our previous work demonstrated our ability to develop consistent EHR-based phenotype definitions that can be deployed across multiple EHRs and institutions. We have expertise leveraging state-of-the-art informatics techniques, including natural language processing and ontologies, for pharmacogenetic studies, including for statins. We first described the PheWAS approach to not only replicate genetic associations but also discover novel, pleiotropic associations. Our informatics expertise combined with an ideal EHR/DNA population, will enable us to validate and discover statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we propose the following three aims: 1. develop and test EHR-based phenotype algorithms for four controversial statin pleiotropic effects, 2. conduct a PheWAS to discover unknown statin pleiotropic effects, and 3. evaluate and discover genetic predictors of statin pleiotropic effects. Project Narrative Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), among the most widely prescribed agents worldwide for prevention of cardiovascular diseases, produce substantial pleiotropic effects. Statin pleiotropic effects are unanticipatedly broad and the genetic variants associated with statin pleiotropic effects remain unclear. We propose to investigate statin pleiotropic effects using whole de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of >2 million patients at Vanderbilt (including 10,000 genotyped statin recipients) to answer these questions.",Exploring Statin Pleiotropic Effects within a Very Large EHR Cohort,9881338,R01HL133786,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Breast', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cataract', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Colorectal', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'General Population', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lymphoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prostate', 'Qi', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'TCF7L2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer risk', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cohort', 'data sharing', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'glutaryl coA', 'individual response', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'pleiotropism', 'response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,395483,0.12320791720860534
"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data. In patients with diabetes at risk of cardiovascular disease events, I will examine the impact that missing data has on the ability to use the EHR for clinical research and develop approaches to address the biases resulting from missing data.",Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD,9994001,K01HL140146,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Baptist Church', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Privacy', 'Publishing', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'South Carolina', 'Stroke', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'care seeking', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data quality', 'distributed data', 'electronic data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'practical application', 'professor', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'study population']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,165444,0.0495756790443429
"Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease ABSTRACT Biobehavioral Studies of Cardiovascular Disease (PO1-HL040962) This Program Project (P01) continuation application focuses on the human brain substrates of behavioral and socio-environmental influences on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in midlife adults. Proposed are 3 Projects that are conceptually cross-linked and supported by 3 Core Units. Collaborative investigators represent multiple disciplines, including psychology, neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, psychoneuroimmunology, epidemiology, machine learning, bioinformatics, and statistics. Project 1 aims to elucidate functional and structural brain phenotypes that predict the multiyear progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, with a focus on neural circuitries for visceral control that coordinate autonomic, neuroendocrine, hemodynamic, and immune physiology with stress- and emotion-related behavioral processes. Project 2 aims to establish whether functional characteristics of these visceral control circuits moderate the influences of stress-related environmental exposures on the progression of preclinical vascular disease and dysfunction, tracking individuals' behavior and cardiovascular physiology in daily life to test a novel neuro-diathesis model of CVD risk. Project 2 also tests for the first time whether daily life physical activity associates with daily life stress physiology through its effects neural circuits for visceral control. Project 3 aims extend those of the other Projects by elucidating the neural and peripheral processes linking physical activity with physiological and psychophysiological markers of CVD risk (including daily life affect and stress physiology) using an experimental intervention methodology. These P01 aims are unique in cardiovascular behavioral medicine, and they will be pursued in the context of multi-component data collection efforts that satisfy all project-specific aims. As a result, the P01 will create new opportunities for integrative and translational science on the human neurobiology of CVD risk that cuts across multiple methods and levels of analysis. Helping to advance its parent field, the P01 will generate and disseminate original and expansive public-domain resources and tools to the broader scientific and clinical communities through comprehensive data and software sharing and educational objectives. Enabling a precise focus on early CVD etiology, the study cohorts comprise nearly 900 midlife adults without clinically apparent CVD, and study methods will include novel combinations of neuroimaging, ecological momentary assessments of experienced environments, ambulatory hemodynamic monitoring, autonomic, neuroendocrine, immune, and vascular assessments, laboratory clinical evaluations, hetero-method health behavior assessments, and arterial imaging. The 3 Core Units of this P01 provide for synergy and inter-project coordination by administrative, data management and participant accrual services; measurement and instrumentation support; and direction in cutting-edge bio-statistical and data-intensive (machine learning) analyses. The present application thus represents a thematic continuation and next- generation extension of translational neurobiological research on CVD by this P01, which was initiated in 1988.

"Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure Project Summary/Abstract Blood pressure (BP) of ³140/90 mm Hg doubles the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the total cost of hypertension reaches as high as $51 billion per year. Despite the enormous risk and cost associated with hypertension, less than half (48.3%) of hypertensive patients have a controlled blood pressure (BP) in the United States. Clinical trials demonstrated that a high rate of BP control (up to 85%) can be achieved with currently available therapies and strictly following recommended treatment protocols. This suggests that a higher proportion of uncontrolled BP could be explained by less aggressive treatment, poorer follow-up, and use of fewer or less effective drugs. The 2017 guideline for high BP management was recently published and lowered the threshold for the initiation of medication and definition of uncontrolled BP to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from 140/90) for patients with CVD or higher risk of CVD. This challenges physicians to change their traditional hypertension management and could worsen the already low rate of compliance (range 25-65%) to hypertension treatment guidelines. Furthermore, conclusions from previous studies regarding compliance to older hypertension treatment guidelines were compromised due to failure to evaluate multiple aspects of hypertension care, such as comorbidities, follow-up and laboratory assessments; and use of subjective assessment such as physician self-report. The wide-spread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) technology and the vital patient information present in EHR data provide an exceptional opportunity to objectively evaluate several aspects of hypertension care, such as medications prescribed, laboratory procedures ordered, BP level achieved, follow-up monitoring examinations, demographic and comorbid information. We, therefore, propose to use the Northwestern Medicine Enterprise Data Warehouse (NMEDW) – an integrated EHR database of health information from 2.9 million patients to 1) assess compliance to the 2017 hypertension management guidelines for 5 years since its release (2018-2022); 2) investigate whether patient’s age, race, body mass index, history of diabetes, CVD, chronic kidney disease, medication adherence, presence of health insurance and regular physician, and physican speciality predict level of compliance to the new treatment guideline; and 3) examine the association between level of compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines and prospective patient BP trajectory over 5 years (2019-2023). Newly diagnosed hypertensive patients’ demographics, BP, medications, lab results, follow-up visit, and comorbid conditions will be assessed from the NMEDW and will be compared to criteria developed based on the 2017 hypertension treatment guidelines to quantify compliance to the guideline. The proposed study provides the candidate an opportunity to learn EHR data-mining skills to assess association between compliance to the new hypertension treatment guideline and patient BP trajectory and to identify predictors of this compliance, as a first step, in designing future targeted interventions to enhance guideline compliance and BP control. Project Narrative The 2017 hypertension treatment guideline lowered the threshold for the initiation of hypertensive medication and definition of uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) to BP ≥130/80 mm Hg (from ≥140/90). This could worsen the already low rate of compliance (25-65%) to treatment guidelines. In this study, we will evaluate physician compliance to the 2017 hypertension treatment guideline and its association with patient BP using electronic health record data that comprises information on several aspects of hypertension care. Findings of this study will help in designing future targeted interventions to enhance compliance to treatment guideline and BP control.",Quantifying Compliance to the New 2017 Hypertension Treatment Guidelines and Investigating the Association Between Guideline Compliance and Patients' Trajectory of Blood Pressure,9870519,K01HL145345,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug effect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'E-learning', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hypertension', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Procedures', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Obesity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Visit', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'demographics', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'medication compliance', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prospective', 'skills', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K01,2020,120966,0.027140726259063726
"Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology Project Summary/Abstract The candidate’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on the neurophysiological pathways that link psychological stress with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individual differences in biological responses to acute psychological stress have been shown to predict risk for subclinical and clinical markers of CVD, indicating that variation in the stress response relates to measurable health outcomes. The proposed research and career development program will position the candidate to definitively address open and mechanistic questions on cardiovascular stress physiology with a multi-dimensional approach. The overall objective of the current project is to identify the ‘brain–cardiovascular’ pathways of metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress. The central hypothesis is that metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress are caused by increased brain activation in areas associated with cardiovascular and autonomic control. In extension, the candidate will test whether altering brain function via neuromodulation will regulate downstream cardiovascular responses. Proposed are two independent studies. In Aim 1, we will newly examine the relationship between metabolically excessive cardiovascular and neural responses using a cross-sectional approach. In Aim 2, we will measure stressor-evoked metabolic and cardiovascular responses before and after neuromodulation in an experimental approach. Participants will engage in a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique, transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS), known to alter the brain by increasing oxygenation, and will be compared to an established control. This research plan will help the candidate develop essential skills for career development including cardiovascular and metabolic testing, machine learning and cross-validation methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, and utilizing a neuromodulation technique, TILS. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide 5 years of training through a combination of research, classroom experiences, and mentoring to further the candidate in preparation for scientific independence. Specifically, the candidate will gain expertise in measuring metabolic activity, advance her computational neuroimaging analysis skills, become proficient in experimentally manipulating brain function, and develop necessary statistical skills. The project brings together a mentoring team of experts in their respective areas to provide the candidate with the necessary skills to continue on the trajectory to make a transformative contribution to the field of Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine. This project will provide vital information regarding the pathways between psychological stress and CVD risk while at the same time providing training and mentoring for the candidate’s further career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exaggerated physiological responses to psychological stress are commonly regarded as contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonetheless, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which psychological responses to threat are translated into cardiovascular responses that are excessive to the immediate physiological needs of the individual. The project will use both cross-sectional and experimental approaches to examine how the brain and cardiovascular system interact during psychological stress and will provide a a more comprehensive understanding of the role the brain plays in metabolically-excessive responses to stress. This research is relevant to public health because it is a crucial step in understanding how psychological stress relates to a risk factor for CVD and is necessary to develop appropriate brain- based approaches to CVD risk prevention and stratification.",Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology,9986887,K01HL145021,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Markers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Limbic System', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Professional Competence', 'Program Development', 'Psychological Stress', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'experience', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stressor', 'time use']",NHLBI,BAYLOR UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,152186,0.11843202306456174
"Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study Project Summary Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the primary cause of death and a major cause of years of life lost in the US and in the world. Cohort studies conducted in North America and Europe have provided crucial information in identifying exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as a cause of increased CVD risks. They have also pointed out important directions for future research, including the differential toxicity of PM2.5 chemical constituents to CVD incidence, the shape of concentration-response (C-R) functions, impact of exposure time windows and indoor air pollution exposure. The objectives of our study are to assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and incident CVD, and investigate the impact of exposure time window and indoor air pollution on these associations. Approach. We will conduct a retrospective multi-cohort study in China using personal health records from five national cohorts with adjudicated CVD endpoints maintained by the Fuwai Hospital. To provide individual-level exposure trajectories for ~120,000 cohort participants during their follow-up period, we will develop an ensemble machine learning model using ground air quality measurements, satellite data, and air quality model simulations to generate 1 km resolution national PM2.5 mass and major constituent (sulfates, nitrates, elemental carbon, organic carbon, lead, and nickel) exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 1). Using cohort data from 2007 to 2020 for our main analyses, we will use Cox proportional hazard models to estimate the associations of long-term exposures to PM2.5 constituents and adverse cardiovascular outcomes including total CVD, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke (Aim 2). Variations of this model will be used to investigate the shape of the C-R functions (linear vs. non-linear) as well as the impact of exposure errors using exposure estimates between 1998 and 2020 (Aim 2a). We will also examine windows of susceptibility for CVD endpoints using both time-variant and time- invariant exposure metrics (Aim 2b). Finally, we will evaluate the confounding effect of indoor air pollution on the C-R functions using a sub-cohort with estimated personal PM2.5 exposure estimates based on Fuwai Hospital's ongoing Multi-Region Panel Study (Aim 2c). Expected Results. Given the tremendous variability in PM2.5 constituent concentrations in China over time and space, our findings will contribute new PM2.5 constituent-specific C-R functions in CVD burden calculation in both the US and the world. Our study will also expand our knowledge on important factors affecting these associations such as exposure window and indoor air pollution. Narrative This study will assess the associations between long-term exposure to PM2.5 constituents and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in a retrospective multi-cohort study. Usinig five national cohorts and multi-city indoor air pollution measurements in China, we will investigate the shape of the CVD concentration-response functions and the impacts of indoor air pollution and exposure windows. The findings of this study will provide additional scientific support for designing effective policy and public health actions to lower the CVD burden in both the US and China.",Cardiovascular health and exposure to PM2.5 constituents: a multi-cohort study,10034502,R01ES032140,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Caliber', 'Carbon', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'China', 'Chinese People', 'Cities', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Concentration measurement', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Outcome', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meteorology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nickel', 'Nitrates', 'North America', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Health Records', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Sulfate', 'Supercomputing', 'Tennessee', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urbanization', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'ambient air pollution', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'fine particles', 'follow-up', 'insight', 'land use', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'particle', 'response', 'study population', 'years of life lost']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,615182,0.08582055118115754
"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention,9991720,R01AG063887,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Vessels', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'aging brain', 'black/white disparity', 'brain health', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'coronary artery calcification', 'critical period', 'dementia risk', 'early life exposure', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'fasting glucose', 'heart function', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'middle age', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'treatment strategy', 'trend', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,R01,2020,755657,0.1271394987862623
"Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors disproportionately affect black adults, and these disparities are evident early in the life course. Genetic factors do not appear to explain this difference, and studies have increasingly implicated socioeconomic risk factors. Among the most prominent risk factors for racial disparities in CVD is educational attainment, which is strongly correlated with smoking, hypertension, and CVD over the life course. Yet it is unclear which aspects of schooling are most salient. One possible explanation for racial disparities in CVD is that black youth often attend highly racially segregated schools. Segregation is thought to be linked with CVD due to increased stress and discrimination; social norms and peer influence; and the constraining of socioeconomic opportunities that reduces income and healthcare access later in life. Yet despite the fact that school segregation has increased in recent years, there are no studies examining the effects of recent school segregation trends on CVD risk factors. The goal of this study is to provide this urgently needed evidence. In particular, we take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on the effects of education on CVD. Since 1990, numerous local court decisions have resulted in “resegregation” in school districts across the country. We link nationwide data on these court decisions and school district-level measures of school segregation with CVD outcome data from two large nationally representative U.S. cohort studies of affected youth: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health, N≈90,000) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N≈8,000). We employ the quasi-experimental technique of instrumental variables analysis, which reduces typical confounding by factors such as unobserved individual and family characteristics. In Aim 1, our goal is to estimate the short- term effects of school segregation on CVD risk factors—including smoking, physical activity, obesity, and mental health—among youth while they are still in school. In Aim 2, we will examine the long-term effects of school segregation in the decades that follow, with outcomes including those in Aim 1 in addition to objectively measured CVD biomarkers, diabetes, and hypertension. We will also undertake exploratory analyses to determine possible mediating pathways. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of CVD risk factors differs in response to school racial segregation. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of school racial segregation on CVD risk factors, helping to inform school-based, clinical, and community interventions to reduce persistent and inequitable racial disparities in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the short-term and long-term effects of school racial segregation on risk factors for heart disease. We will also assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to school segregation. This will inform the development of public health programs and school-based interventions to address black-white disparities in heart disease.",Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults,9943540,R01HL151638,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Country', 'Court Decisions', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desegregation', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Family Characteristics', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life Stress', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistics', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health', 'Natural experiment', 'Obesity', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'black/white disparity', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'community intervention', 'data archive', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'forest', 'health care availability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'novel marker', 'panel study of income dynamics', 'peer influence', 'peer networks', 'physical inactivity', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'racial disparity', 'resilience', 'response', 'school district', 'segregation', 'social', 'social norm', 'socioeconomics', 'teenage fertility', 'theories', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'young adult']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,808862,0.12128263596639043
"Metal-nutrient mixtures in epidemiologic and toxicologic studies of cardiovascular disease Abstract This proposal is designed to extend and complement our R01-funded case-cohort study of cadmium (Cd) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Herein we will add arsenic (As), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) to our case-cohort study and include epidemiologic and toxicologic mixtures analyses. The four elements we have selected are compelling for their independent role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and as a mixture. As increases plaque formation and adhesion to endothelium and Cd also induces endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis; yet it is not clear if the effects of As and Cd are synergistic or competing. To potentially counteract these processes, Mg is important for modulating endothelial function. While Ca’s role is equivocal, its role in calcification of the arteries is undeniable, making it important to consider as well. Our efficient case-cohort study design includes 810 cases of AMI and a comparison subcohort of 600 men and 600 women selected randomly from never smokers at risk of AMI at the start of follow-up, leveraging the prospective population-based Danish Diet Cancer and Health Cohort. We are already funded to measure Cd, creatinine, osmolality, and cotinine in baseline urine samples. We now propose to additionally analyze As species, Mg, and Ca in urine among ~2000 participants selected into this case-cohort study, along with pre-existing food frequency questionnaire data on Mg and Ca. In Aim 1 we will evaluate the association between each of As, Ca, and Mg, and incidence of AMI. This will be one of the largest prospective studies of these elements in relation to AMI. In Aim 2 we will apply mixtures methods (Bayesian kernel machine regression, weighted quantile sum regression, random forests) to evaluate the interactive and joint effects of Cd, As, Ca, and Mg in relation to AMI risk. In Aim 3 we will apply in vitro and in vivo approaches to study combined effects of exposure to these elements to investigate the toxicologic mechanisms and pathways of activity. Each Aim is independently compelling and will provide important scientific contributions but together the complementary approaches have the potential to provide evidence of consistency in findings across the distinct approaches. Triangulating data across in vitro, in vivo and epidemiologic analyses represents a translational bridge as depicted in the NIEHS translational research framework. The scope of this virtual consortium will enrich our understanding of the relationships between Cd, As, Mg, Ca, and CVD. Other innovative features of our study include leveraging an existing efficient case-cohort design, large sample size, a large number of incident AMI events, controlling for tobacco smoking, in vitro assays of pro-atherogenic mechanisms, and in vivo studies of atherosclerosis. Sources of exposure to these elements are well known, therefore the identification of mixtures of these elements as cardiovascular risk/protective factors can have major implications for the prevention and control of CVD. Public Health Relevance Mechanistic and epidemiologic studies suggest a mixture of elements including cadmium, arsenic, magnesium, and calcium may play an important role in cardiovascular disease as risk and protective factors. We propose to create a virtual consortium to study chemical mixtures of these elements in relation to risk of cardiovascular disease using state-of-the-art techniques in exposure science, epidemiology, biostatistics, and cardio-toxicology. Sources of exposure to these elements are well known, therefore the identification of mixtures of these elements as cardiovascular risk/protective factors can have major implications for the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease.",Metal-nutrient mixtures in epidemiologic and toxicologic studies of cardiovascular disease,10063369,R01ES030938,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adhesions', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arsenic', 'Arteries', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cadmium', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Cotinine', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Elements', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Hypertension', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Joints', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lipids', 'Magnesium', 'Measures', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nutrient', 'Osmolalities', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Questionnaires', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Side', 'Smoking', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Toxicology', 'Translational Research', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'calcification', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'diet and cancer', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'macrophage', 'men', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'never smoker', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'urinary', 'virtual']",NIEHS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2020,618191,0.05118838049320435
"Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project involves the development of new statistical methodologies and computational tools for network-based integrative analysis of epigenetic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). While the advent of omics data from new technologies has facilitated the study of epigenetic factors, existing methodologies often do not account for complexities of biological data  such as correlations due to interactions of genes/proteins as part of biological pathways  and fail to eﬃciently integrate diverse omics data sets  for instance genetic variation, DNA methylation and gene expression. The methodologies proposed in this project, and the software tools that will be developed to implement them, address these shortcomings, and facilitate further research by the biomedical community to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of CVD, and to develop new diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapies. The proposed methodologies are motivated by the study of epigenetic data from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and include (i) a network-based pathway enrichment analysis method that incorporates available knowledge of interactions among genes and proteins while complementing and reﬁning such information (Aim 1A), as well as its extension for analysis of multiple types of omics data (Aim 1B), and (ii) an integrative analysis framework to identify associations among gene expression levels and DNA methylation (Aim 2A) and identify common epigenetic factors of multiple CVD phenotypes through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and mRNA expression data (Aim 2B). We will develop eﬃcient and user-friendly software tools for the proposed methods (Aim 3), which will be made freely available to the public after extensive tests using both simulated data, as well as real data from MESA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses the need for development of new statistical machine learning methods for analysis of diverse epigenetic data from multiple cardiovascular disease outcomes. The proposed training activities are designed to enhance the applicant's knowledge of epigenetics and physiology of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and to further his career as an independent investigator in the area of computational epigenetics for CVD.",Statistical Methods for Network-Based Integrative Analysis of CVD Epigenetic Data,9838771,K01HL124050,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training Activity', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'epigenetic marker', 'flexibility', 'gene interaction', 'genetic risk factor', 'high dimensionality', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'learning network', 'mRNA Expression', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'training opportunity', 'user friendly software', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K01,2020,137714,0.02130433063543417
"Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data SUMMARY Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and is largely considered preventable by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Lipid-lowering therapy is the current mainstay of preventative treatment for ASCVD and guidelines for pharmacotherapy rely on the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) for estimating 10-year risk. While these equations have been validated at a population level they have significant shortcomings that impact real-world patient-level effectiveness. These include implementation (i.e. time and effort for clinicians to enter patient data into a phone or web-based calculator), therapy changing sensitivity to highly variable inputs (e.g single time point blood pressure), paradoxical risk estimation for some patient subgroups that are an artifact of linear modeling (e.g. women smokers), blunt treatment of race (i.e. separately derived equations for black patients), and poor calibration for modern cohorts (i.e. resulting in the overestimation of risk). This project will attempt to address these shortcomings. First, portable tools for analyzing electronic health records found within the Rhode Island Health Information Exchange (HIE) will be developed for the extraction of PCE risk factors to enable the automated calculation of ASCVD risk. PCE risk factor extraction permutations (e.g. last vs mean blood pressure) will be optimized and the equations will be calibrated for the population. Next, EHR-system agnostic tools for extracting additional risk factors available within the medical record including symptom development, social determinants of health, and family history will be developed. PCE and non-PCE risk factors will be used for artificial neural network and dynamic Bayesian network modeling of ASCVD risk phenotype clusters to augment PCE risk prediction. Finally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data derived ASCVD genetic risk score will be integrated with the HIE derived risk factors to demonstrate the potential clinical implications of implementing an omics-integrated learning healthcare system. The project will serve as foundational training for the principal investigator towards pursuing a career as a physician-scientist in the field of biomedical informatics. Hypothesis: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation is central to current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. This project will test the hypothesis that population-level data-driven methods will improve the accuracy of risk calculators. Aim 1: Determine the Predictive Performance of PCE Risk Factors Derived from Longitudinal HIE Data Aim 2: Define Population-Based ASCVD Risk Phenotype Clusters Aim 3: Demonstrate HIE-Omics-Integrated Learning Healthcare System with Direct-to-Consumer Sequencing NARRATIVE Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death and the most significant contributor to disability-adjusted life years in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and ten-year risk estimation is the foundation of current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. The success of this project will improve the prediction of ASCVD and serve as a model for health information exchange derived risk estimation and population-guided preventative therapy recommendation.",Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data,10068605,F30LM013320,"['Address', 'Age', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Maps', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive therapy', 'Preventive treatment', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'SNP genotyping', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoker', 'Smoking Status', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'disability-adjusted life years', 'genomic data', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mathematical sciences', 'mortality', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'polygenic risk score', 'population based', 'portability', 'recruit', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'tool']",NLM,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,0.11430936749062151
"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,9975704,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,435018,0.056050163343076935
"Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects 70% of older adults and remains the leading cause of morbidity and mor- tality in the United States. Several new drugs have recently been approved for CVD, but not enough is known about their utilization, benefits and risks in frail older patients. Since conducting a clinical trial in frail older adults can be costly and impractical, there is a pressing need for innovative strategies to generate evidence on new CVD drugs in a timely manner. The objective of this application is to establish a near-real-time prospective monitoring program in Medicare data to evaluate the benefit of new CVD drugs for older adults with frailty. A prospective monitoring program seeks to find early effectiveness and safety signals of new drugs by updating the analysis at regular intervals as new Medicare data become available. The investigators will incorporate a novel claims-based frailty index into the monitoring program to generate timely evidence on disease-specific and patient-centered net benefit of new drugs by frailty status. The central hypothesis is that disease-specific benefit and net benefit are determined by a patient's degree of frailty. Disease-specific benefit will be evaluated using clinical trial endpoints of effectiveness (e.g., CVD events) and safety (e.g., bleeding), and net benefit in terms of the number of days alive and spent at home, or “home time”. To conduct this work, the investigators will analyze Medicare data on 6 new CVD drugs approved in 2011-2017: 3 anticoagulants vs warfarin for atrial fibrillation, 2 antiplatelets vs clopidogrel for atherosclerotic CVD, and an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor vs enalapril for systolic heart failure. The validity and reproducibility of the results will be enhanced through the linkage of a subset of Medicare data to electronic health records and a national survey to supplement clinical information, and external validation of the Medicare data analysis in 2 large commercial databases. In the next 4 years, the investigators will accomplish 3 specific aims: 1) evaluate the temporal trends and predictors of new CVD drug use in frail and non-frail older adults with CVD over 2011-2020; 2) determine disease-specific benefit (deaths, CVD and safety events) and net benefit (home time) of 6 new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies; 3) identify patient characteristics that can predict net benefit (home time) with new CVD drugs compared with alternative therapies. This proposal's innovative approach, which combines near-real-time prospective monitor- ing, a claims-based frailty score, and the patient-centered outcome of home time, offers a readily scalable and feasible framework for comparative effectiveness and safety studies of newly approved medications. The impact of the proposed research is significant because timely evidence generated from real-world healthcare data can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new CVD drugs based on a patient's frailty and expected net benefit. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research aims to establish a prospective monitoring program for newly approved cardiovascular drugs for older adults with frailty in routine healthcare databases and identify predictors of benefit from the new drugs. This research is relevant to public health because the evidence generated from this work can enable clinicians to optimize prescribing of new cardiovascular drugs in older adults based on a patient's frailty level and expected net benefit. Thus, it accomplishes the National Institute on Aging's missions and initiatives by promoting effective and safe drug therapy in older adults.",Prospective Monitoring of Newly Approved Cardiovascular Drugs in Older Adults with Frailty,9936415,R01AG062713,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Alternative Therapies', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Anticoagulants', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enalapril', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frail Elderly', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Neprilysin', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Warfarin', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical trial analysis', 'clopidogrel', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'frailty', 'head-to-head comparison', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'older patient', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'prospective', 'real time monitoring', 'safety study', 'sex']",NIA,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,728922,0.09704904465502896
