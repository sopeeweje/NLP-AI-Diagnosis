"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,9675213,R01AI118833,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'airway obstruction', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'decision tree learning', 'epidemiologic data', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'host microbiome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'nasal microbiome', 'nasal microbiota', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,665560,0.15246172247546624
"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9791316,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2019,246653,0.014068541642154512
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9762973,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data management', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2019,3319382,0.09608036203591792
"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations Project Summary/Abstract of the PRIME parent award: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are major causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity and have profound consequences for maternal and child health, but it is unclear if and how rates of HDP are changing over time, or whether neighborhood conditions (e.g., racial residential segregation) and air pollution exposure are associated with risk of developing HDP. We use detailed birth records and Bayesian spatial analysis methods to better understand how HDP rates have changed over a 20 year period (1995-2014), whether racial/ethnic disparities in HDP rates have narrowed or widened in this time frame, and if neighborhood racial segregation and air pollution exposure are associated with an individual’s HDP risk.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations,9911827,R01ES028819,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Birth Records', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Process', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'data resource', 'early childhood', 'health care availability', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'perinatal morbidity', 'pollutant', 'pregnancy disorder', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'segregation', 'social', 'social stress', 'stressor', 'tool', 'web site']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,117375,0.07803483665624071
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums.

"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed.

"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,9767585,R01ES026033,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cadmium', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Nutrient', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deciduous tooth', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'perinatal period', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'synergism', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2019,608605,0.05185347057887191
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,9750788,R01HL142503,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,807787,0.05508941278794352
"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,9681837,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2019,31591,0.08469731797600336
"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,9755494,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individual response', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory colonization', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2019,50016,0.14709612625147975
"An unobtrusive monitoring device used for tracking asthma symptoms and lung function variability Project Summary/Abstract The application's broad, long-term objective is to develop, evaluate and commercialize a device for continuous monitoring of a child's asthma components (symptoms, lung function variability, nighttime awakenings, etc.) over a few weeks. Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic condition in the US. It affects 6 million children, causes 0.8 million emergency department (ED) visits, 0.13 million hospitalizations and $18 billion annually in healthcare costs. To reduce the burden of uncontrolled asthma, NHLBI evidence-based guidelines require periodic assessment of the child's asthma risk/impairment, and corresponding adjustments to treatment, until asthma control has been established. When assessing asthma impairment, pediatricians depend heavily on the self-report, which is unfortunately unreliable. This leads to underestimation of asthma impairment, undertreatment, and long paths to achieving control. To efficiently and effectively establish asthma control, a wearable device could be used to provide pediatricians an accurate, recent history of asthma components. Currently, no practical solutions exist for weeks-long monitoring of symptom frequency and lung function variability, both of which are critical components for assesing asthma impairment. Via the following Specific Aims, this application will use advances in embedded systems and machine learning to develop a small, wearable device for monitoring asthma symptoms that is (1) acceptable to patients; (2) able to robustly detect cough and wheeze symptoms; and (3) able to passively measure lung function variability. Specific Aim 1: Train and evaluate an algorithm to detect pediatric asthma symptoms (cough and wheeze) on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: 90% sensitivity; false alarm rate: 1 cough epsiode/day or 1 wheeze episode/day. Evaluate algorithm against medical expert (physician) scoring using the two best available asthma scoring tools (AS: asthma score; PRAM: Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure). Specific Aim 2: Design and evaluate algorithm to detect lung function variability on a low power, small form factor wearable device. Specifications: Using respiratory signals from sensor patch, detect variations ≥ 10% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC). Evaluate algorithm against spirometry gold standard. Project Narrative Uncontrolled pediatric asthma is a serious public health concern. There are proven therapies and management guidelines to achieve asthma control in most patients, but poor patient self-report of asthma daily symptoms and components has made this an elusive goal in practice. This project will develop and evaluate a wearable device that provides physicians with an accurate report of their patient's recent asthma symptoms and pulmonary function variability.",An unobtrusive monitoring device used for tracking asthma symptoms and lung function variability,9774468,R41HL146027,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Coughing', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'New England', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Office Visits', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Periodicity', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spirometry', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Vital capacity', 'Wheezing', 'asthmatic patient', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'diaries', 'efficacy study', 'evidence based guidelines', 'follow-up', 'monitoring device', 'off-patent', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatrician', 'phase 2 study', 'preference', 'programs', 'prototype', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NHLBI,"CLAIRWAYS, LLC",R41,2019,204205,0.09752031694134262
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,9813026,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Venous', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,531144,0.0314644330070353
"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9749156,R01ES027747,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cadmium', 'Carbon', 'Carbon Black', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Membrane', 'Mercury', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'RNA marker', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Trace Elements', 'Translations', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vesicle', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'ambient air pollution', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'extracellular vesicles', 'follow-up', 'inflammatory marker', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2019,708647,0.010411492765826593
"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS. Project Narrative The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. This study will validate spatiotemporal statistical approaches in chemical mixture exposure modelling, evaluate the cumulative effects of chemical mixtures in air pollution and acute lung health effects, and determine the extent of exposure misclassification due to human mobility. This proposal aligns with the mission of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.”",Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures,9773051,K99ES029523,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Biochemical', 'Censuses', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Outcome', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'Extramural Activities', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Water', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data integration', 'environmental chemical', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'exposed human population', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'land use', 'personal exposure monitor', 'pollutant', 'professor', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'volatile organic compound']",NIEHS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,K99,2019,125066,0.07514923264973221
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9764378,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2019,81281,-0.0030976036873985504
"Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 proposal describes a comprehensive training program tailored to the career development of the candidate. The candidate is a physician who recently completed a clinical fellowship in Allergy and Immunology and whose research contributions to date have addressed early-life risk factors for childhood asthma and allergy with a focus on the diet and intestinal microenvironment. Asthma and environmental allergies have increased in prevalence and asthma is now the most common chronic disease in children. The increased occurrence of asthma and allergy has been attributed to changes including dietary shifts and dysbiosis, though contributory factors are incompletely defined and interventions to prevent asthma and allergy remain elusive. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (FA) have well-defined immunologic effects, and the ratio of omega-6:omega-3 FA intake has increased concurrently with the increase in allergic disease. However, reported associations of PUFA with asthma and allergy in childhood are inconsistent. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that effects of PUFA are impacted by host genotype and the intestinal microbiota. Our scientific goal is to examine these omics to identify determinants of when a safe and inexpensive intervention, intake of PUFA, is effective in reducing asthma and allergy in childhood. We will utilize data from 6- and 7-year-old participants in three study populations: Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), Project Viva and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC). We have three specific aims: (1) Identify gene by omega-3 FA interactions in asthma and allergy in childhood; (2): Define the contributions of intestinal bacteria and metabolites to associations of omega-3 FA dietary intake with asthma and allergy in childhood; and (3) Characterize clinically relevant childhood plasma PUFA profiles using unsupervised classification methods and integrative machine learning algorithms. Our findings could lead to cost-effective and personalized approaches to asthma and allergy reduction by elucidating which individuals benefit from dietary PUFA supplementation and whether microbiota-modifying therapies could boost protective responses to PUFA. The candidate proposes to execute this research plan alongside a training and development plan including hands-on bioinformatics instruction and preparation for independent mechanistic and clinical R01-level follow-up projects. The proposed work will be mentored by Dr. Scott Weiss, a Professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in environmental, nutritional and genetic asthma risk factors. The candidate will obtain additional scientific input and career guidance from a team including a co-mentor and three scientific advisors with expertise in asthma epidemiology, lipid mediators of allergic inflammation, multi-omics analysis and translational research methods. This proposal represents a natural continuation of the candidate’s prior experience and will provided the support needed for her to become an independent investigator with a focus on precision medicine approaches to asthma and allergy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are dietary fats with effects on immune function and inflammation, and the genes that a person is born with or the bacteria that live in one’s gut could influence how the body processes and responds to PUFA. We will study children to see if having particular gene variants or specific gut bacteria or chemicals impacts how PUFA intake relates to risk of asthma and allergy. Understanding how genetic, microbial, and other factors influence PUFA processing and asthma and allergies could lead to new cost- effective ways to prevent and treat these increasingly common and clinically burdensome diseases.",Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood,9804142,K08HL148178,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergic inflammation', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fatty Acid', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fellowship', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Instruction', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Multiomic Data', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Omega-6 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'defined contribution', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental allergy', 'experience', 'fatty acid supplementation', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immune function', 'learning strategy', 'lipid mediator', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition related genetics', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'response', 'skills', 'study population', 'western diet']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170640,0.12874247805660466
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes. This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction learning.",Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory,9675335,K23MH113708,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Dorsal', 'Exposure to', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Psychology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Severities', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'anxiety symptoms', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'statistics', 'theories', 'treatment of anxiety disorders']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2019,186408,0.03143789616015218
"Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children. In our preliminary study, we discovered significant variations in the volume and quality of clinical documentation on asthma in electronic medical records (EMRs) between pediatric residents and pediatric faculty. For example, although pediatric residents documented much more extensively than the pediatric faculty on asthma-related histories consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, the residents were less likely to make an actual diagnosis of asthma than their faculty counterparts. This variation in documenting asthma-related events in EMRs has two important implications: one is a proficiency issue related to the training of pediatric residents in achieving clinical competence in asthma care and documentation; the other is a data quality issue, which impacts the secondary use of EMR for downstream analyses. At present, little has been reported on the secondary use of EMR for residency training. The primary goal of this proposed study is to develop an informatics tool assessing residents' adherence to asthma guidelines (i.e., competence in asthma care) and documentation variation (i.e., competence in documentation) (Aim 1) and evaluate individual pediatric resident's competence in asthma care and documentation by conducting a population-based birth cohort study (Aim 2). The tool can be utilized to provide “individualized clinical effectiveness data” for residents enhancing their clinical competence in asthma care, as recommended by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). In Aim 1: We will develop an automated informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma guidelines and documentation variation in primary care settings. We will extract the necessary clinical elements from both structured data querying from our database and unstructured data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess adherence to guidelines and documentation variation. The performance of element extraction will be assessed against manual chart reviews as gold standard. In Aim 2: We will evaluate clinical competence of pediatric residents in asthma care and asthma diagnosis. We will assess clinical competence in asthma care for children with persistent asthma and examine clinical competence in asthma diagnosis from clinical documentation using the informatics tool developed in Aim 1. Expected outcomes: The proposed research is significant, innovative, and exploratory as little is known about the secondary use of EMR for residency training. If successful, the study results will: a) deliver individualized clinical effectiveness data report to pediatric residents to enhance their clinical training and documentation; and b) provide an informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma care guidelines in clinical practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children that is frequently evaluated and managed by pediatric residents. No training tools are available that provide individualized feedback on residents' competence in asthma care and documentation from their clinical notes. We address this challenge by developing an automated tool to provide data-driven feedback to individual residents to enhance their competence in asthma care and documentation.",Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation,9663484,R21AI142702,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Competence', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'graduate medical education', 'individualized feedback', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'tool']",NIAID,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2019,238500,0.12197429296468454
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9884859,R00ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIEHS,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R00,2019,249000,0.0909709504874816
"Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous airway disorder characterized by inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperreactivity, and impaired airflow. Severe exacerbations of asthma occur frequently in children and require immediate use of systemic steroid therapy to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization or death. In addition to direct health risks, pediatric asthma exerts a substantial cost burden, as asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalization, and missed school days. Multiple environmental factors are purported to play a role in asthma symptoms, including aeroallergens, pollutants, weather changes, and community viral outbreaks such as influenza. Additionally, asthma prevalence is greater in children of low socioeconomic status (SES) and in African-American and Hispanic/Latino children, suggesting both environmental and genetic effects on asthma incidence and severity. The existence of geographical asthma “hotspots” indicates that asthma prevalence and severity are influenced by place-based risks, including local air quality, built environment factors, access to health care providers, socioeconomic factors, culture, and behavior. To effectively prevent and treat pediatric asthma attacks, it is necessary to understand how patient-specific characteristics interact with environmental factors to render an individual susceptible to severe asthma exacerbations. Lacking sufficient power, previous studies have largely examined suspected asthma triggers in isolation; thus, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding how environmental factors interact with each other and with patient-level factors to promote severe asthma exacerbations in pediatric populations. We hypothesize that a longitudinal analysis of environmental exposures and patient-level factors will elucidate new multifactorial causes of severe asthma exacerbations. To elucidate the contributions and interactions of environmental and patient-level factors, we will apply machine learning approaches to a longitudinal (2007-2017) geocoded database of patient electronic health records detailing asthma-related health encounters and publicly available, overlapping spatiotemporal environmental data. Further, we will evaluate the interactions between person-level clinical factors, including obesity, history of premature birth/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and atopy, to determine their effects on susceptibility to selected environmental triggers. These analyses will 1) provide an analysis of the relative contribution and interactions of environmental factors to pediatric asthma exacerbations, 2) identify geographic hotspots of asthma prevalence and severity, and 3) determine how person-level clinical factors influence susceptibility to different asthma triggers. Our findings will provide new insights into risk factors for severe asthma exacerbations, spur new studies into the biological mechanisms that underlie the interactions between human biology and the environment, inform preventive strategies and patient education efforts, and serve as a model that can be expanded to larger cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma affects 1 in 10 children in the United States, and severe asthma exacerbations require immediate medical attention to prevent hospitalization or death. A wide variety of environmental triggers such as pollutants and allergens are associated with asthma symptoms, but the interaction between different environmental triggers and person-level characteristics such as obesity, allergy, and history of premature birth are unclear. These studies will use longitudinal, overlapping asthma patient and environmental data to understand the role of different environmental triggers in asthma exacerbations in order to develop new preventive and therapeutic strategies for asthma.",Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children,9654855,R21HL145415,"['Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air', 'Allergens', 'Asthma', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fibrinogen', 'Food', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Hispanics', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Biology', 'Humidity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Influenza', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neighborhoods', 'North Carolina', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pollen', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Steroid therapy', 'Symptoms', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'Weather', 'airborne allergen', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'deprivation', 'electronic data', 'health care availability', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medical attention', 'mucus hypersecretion', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urgent care', 'violent crime']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,120500,0.1651455573086637
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,9666310,K23DK117061,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Asia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Duodenum', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gluten', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Pathology', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lactulose', 'Lamina Propria', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocytosis', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multiomic Data', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Virginia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'enteric pathogen', 'imaging approach', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrition', 'oral vaccine', 'patient oriented', 'socioeconomics', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K23,2019,194052,0.02336929376643201
"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in pediatric obese asthma.",Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility.,9665877,K08AI135091,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allergens', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Response', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interleukin-13', 'Knockout Mice', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'PD-1 pathway', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Activation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Th2 Cells', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Weights and Measures', 'Work', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'antiviral immunity', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'dimensional analysis', 'drinking water', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pediatric patients', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational approach']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K08,2019,186948,0.03859182902163354
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9729825,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,173441,0.06825132283150166
"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9652630,R21ES030175,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anions', 'Archives', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Caffeine', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Chronic', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Policy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'agricultural pesticide', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain health', 'case control', 'cell type', 'disorder control', 'disorder risk', 'environmental pesticide exposure', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pesticide exposure', 'population based', 'residence', 'response', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,209000,0.05146523442237858
"Determining the Role of the Upper and Lower Airway Microbiota as Drivers of Concomitant Inflammatory Responses in patients with Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Asthma 123 456 789 1101 1123 1145 1167 1189 2201 2223 2245 2267 2289 ABSTRACT Despite growing efforts to understand the role of the microbiota in airway disease, mechanisms that link microbial community dysbiosis to chronic inflammation remain elusive. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a significant health problem in the United States, costing up to $65 billion each year and affecting up to 16% of the US population. CRS patients frequently present with pulmonary comorbidities suggesting that there are common underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to upper and lower airway inflammation, known as the unified airways concept. In this proposal, we aim to understand the role of the upper and lower airway microbiota in driving concurrent immune responses in patients with CRS and asthma. Asthma is a common pulmonary disease that has strong clinical and epidemiological associations with CRS: Between 20%- 60% of CRS patients with nasal polyps have asthma. Dysbiotic microbial communities have been reported in sinuses of CRS patients and in the lungs of asthmatics, however, the microbiome or host immune response of these sites have not been examined in parallel. The goal of this proposal is to establish the existence of an upper-lower airway axis by sequencing the bacterial and fungal microbiome, profiling the host immune response, and through in vitro experiments that aim to identify bacterial metabolites in mixed-species culture that drive type-2 inflammation. Supporting the concept of a unified airway, our preliminary data show dysbiotic microbial communities in the upper and lower airways of CRS patients with asthma and concurrent type-2 inflammation shared across the airway sites. To expand these studies, we will use an integrated multi-omics approach to investigate the fundamental basis of microbiome structure and function in the context of the immune response of patient-matched upper and lower airway samples from CRS patients (with or without asthma) and healthy individuals that we have banked over the past four years. From these analyses, we will be able to infer the ecological relationships that contribute to chronic inflammation in concurrent upper and lower airway disease. In the second aim, we will determine whether and how pathogenic microbial communities drive or exacerbate airway inflammatory responses in vitro. We will characterize the metabolome in CRS/Asthma- patients and confirm these metabolites are of microbial origin in mixed species biofilm culture. To determine interaction with the host, we will sensitize peripheral blood dendritic cells (DCs) with CRS-Asthma associated metabolites, then co-culture DCs with naïve T cells and quantify T cell differentiation. This study will contribute to our understanding of the upper-lower airway axis in unified airway disease and will ultimately lead to therapeutics aimed a manipulating the upper airway microbiome for treating concurrent sinus and lung disease. 1234 567  Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and asthma are significant public health problem, accounting for over 5% of the  total healthcare costs in the United States each year. Dysbiosis of the sinonasal microbiome has been  proposed as a significant driver of airway inflammation, however the composition or activities of these complex 89  microbial assemblages are not well understood. The studies proposed here will provide a high-resolution  characterization of the airway bacterial microbiome and metabolome CRS patients with asthma. Mechanistic in  vitro studies of CRS/asthma associated metabolites will uncover specific microbial mechanisms that  exacerbate host inflammatory responses in the upper and lower airways.

"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome,9773075,RC2DK118619,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bile duct carcinoma', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'High Performance Computing', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Disease', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Network-based', 'Norway', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical database', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'pollutant', 'primary outcome', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,RC2,2019,1566059,0.05113384082374951
"A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage ABSTRACT Infertility and spontaneous abortion (SAB) are significant public health problems, affecting up to 25% of reproductive age couples in the United States. Health care costs attributable to infertility and SAB exceed $5 billion per year, and several studies have shown an association between infertility treatments and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors for subfertility and SAB is an important public health goal. The potential effects of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on risk of subfertility and SAB are understudied. The few existing human studies have limitations including small sample size, enrollment after conception, retrospective study design, suboptimal assessment of exposure and outcome, inadequate control for potential confounding variables, and limited generalizability. The proposed study will prospectively assess the relation of exposure to selected EDCs, including phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), to risk of subfertility and SAB in a preconception subcohort of 950 pregnancy planners. We will use data from two NICHD-supported prospective cohorts of pregnancy planners in North America and Denmark. With web-based recruitment and data collection, we have enrolled over 17,000 women attempting pregnancy into these cohorts. In a subset of 200 participants, we have successfully pilot tested in-person collection of urine and blood specimens during the preconception and early pregnancy periods. In this application, we propose to expand in-person biospecimen collection, increasing the number of women with preconception and early pregnancy urine and blood samples from 200 to 950. At each of our three biospecimen collection sites (Boston, Detroit, and Aarhus), we will enroll 250 women and collect three urine samples and one blood sample (in preconception) and three urine samples and one blood sample (in early pregnancy). We will ship the samples to the CDC for the analysis of urinary phthalates, urinary phenols, and serum PFAS. To increase cost efficiency, we will pool three urine samples in each exposure window before assaying for phthalates and phenols; and we will assay one preconception blood specimen for PFAS, a persistent chemical, in analyses of subfertility and SAB. Finally, we will conduct a pilot study among 100 U.S. participants to assess the feasibility of collecting urine by mail, which would allow us to take advantage of our full geographically-diverse cohort in the future. Strengths of this application include the prospective design, preconception enrollment of pregnancy planners, repeated measurement of exposure during preconception and early pregnancy, excellent control for confounding via bimonthly prospective data collection on a wide range of covariates, and use of the latest analytic methods for mixtures modeling. We have generated compelling preliminary data to support our aims. The present grant is cost-effective in leveraging already-established cohort studies with data collection and follow-up supported by other grants. The results generated will be translatable by directly informing future regulatory decisions about EDC standards in a manner that could reduce rates of infertility and SAB. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nearly 15% of all couples have difficulty becoming pregnant and up to 25% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Infertility and miscarriage can cause profound psychological and financial hardship for those affected, and they account for more than 5 billion dollars in U.S. health care costs each year. Identifying modifiable risk factors for infertility and miscarriage, including environmental pollutants (phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances), is an important public health goal.","A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage",9638779,R01ES029951,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Benzophenones', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Boston', 'Canada', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Conceptions', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cost efficiency', 'Couples', 'Cyclohexanes', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Denmark', 'Dicarboxylic Acids', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Esters', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Financial Hardship', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Infertility', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'North America', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parabens', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phenols', 'Pilot Projects', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Serum', 'Ships', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Sum', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'chemical standard', 'child bearing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'early pregnancy', 'early pregnancy loss', 'environmental chemical', 'follow-up', 'health goals', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infertility treatment', 'innovation', 'male', 'modifiable risk', 'phthalates', 'pregnant', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'subfertility', 'time-to-pregnancy', 'trying to conceive', 'urinary']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,632737,0.015941845372524997
"Identify, Analyze, and Evaluate Potential Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) - 2018 ABSTRACT ALS is a devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure or effective treatment. The causes of ALS likely involve interaction of environmental and genetic susceptibility factors. Exposure to the damaging environmental stressors likely occurs at particularly susceptible time-periods, and for a prolonged period. We will investigate the époques during which environmental exposures carry the greatest risk for later development of ALS. We will use questionnaire data, residential history, and DNA samples from our on-going epidemiologic studies in Northern New England and Ohio, the existing environmental and genetic variant data from the National ALS Registry for ALS patients nationwide, and both clinic- and random population-based controls. We will use geospatial algorithms to estimate residential exposures in years extending backwards for ~30 years derived from our databases of time-linked contents of sources of environmental toxins (cyanobacteria) and toxicants (landfills, municipal incinerators, Superfund and Brownfield sites, pesticide applications). We also propose to identify genetic risk factors for ALS that manifest effects specifically in the presence of an environmental stressor. We will use the existing Illumina NeuroChip data covering 500,000 genetic variants implicated in neurodegenerative illness on the National ALS Biorepository participants, and propose to assay our epidemiologic study DNA samples on the same panel to construct a large, pooled genotype dataset. Genetic imputation will allow genome-wide coverage for identification of novel variants. We will employ the machine- learning methods to identify gene x environment interactions, the genetic variants that synergize with environmental stressors to increase disease risk. This project has the potential to identify the environmental and genetic risk factors in periods of temporal susceptibility that will lead to disease prevention through exposure mitigation, early-identification, and development of interventions to block disease progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The prevention and cure of ALS require identification of susceptibility genes and the most important environmental risk factors, their most sensitive period of exposure, and the implementation of steps to mitigate these exposures. We propose to use residential history to estimate exposures to waterbody cyanobacteria, pesticides, and polluted sites in ALS patients compared to healthy controls using time-linked databases. We expect these studies to reveal genetic variants that raise ALS susceptibility, and determine the periods of life that carry the greatest risk for developing ALS from exposures to environmental stressors.","Identify, Analyze, and Evaluate Potential Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) - 2018",9918209,R01TS000288,[' '],ATSDR,DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK CLINIC,R01,2019,500000,0.03903213209790886
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,9617736,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Emergency Situation', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,600285,0.0812461945194097
"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification. This is particularly important for science, given the fact that students from high- poverty schools are economically disadvantaged and may comprise a large proportion of individuals from minority groups that are underrepresented in science.",Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram,9605786,R25ES028974,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Case Study', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High School Faculty', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'K-12 Faculty', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Predisposition', 'Program Development', 'Program Evaluation', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'STEM career', 'School Teachers', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Teaching Method', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'apprenticeship', 'base', 'college', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'design', 'environmental stressor', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'exposure route', 'health literacy', 'health science research', 'high school program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experience', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pedagogical content', 'programs', 'response', 'science teacher', 'skills', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'stressor', 'summer research', 'teacher', 'tool']",NIEHS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2019,99506,0.02360265457340757
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric.

"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health.

"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health.

"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Project Summary: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Environmental exposure mixtures, especially when coupled with social stressors, have the potential to compromise developmental outcomes in children, but have been understudied. We will use a unique longitudinal dataset that tracks children from birth through early elementary school, in combination with new tools from modern data science, to disentangle the complex effects of these mixtures on educational outcomes.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures,9440248,R01ES028819,"['Address', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Architecture', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Factors', 'Birth', 'Birth Records', 'Carbon Monoxide', 'Censuses', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cox Models', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'North Carolina', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Particle Size', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pollution', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Sulfur Dioxide', 'System', 'Taxes', 'Time', 'Unemployment', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'Work', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'early childhood', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care availability', 'indexing', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'pollutant', 'programs', 'rural environment', 'simulation', 'social', 'social stress', 'stressor', 'tool', 'web site']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,506174,0.07371445843951664
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9595726,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,750105,0.023622061867725877
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health.

"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,9567692,R01HL142503,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,883091,0.05508941278794352
"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,9472205,R01AI118833,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epidemiologic data', 'forest', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'host microbiome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'nasal microbiome', 'nasal microbiota', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2018,714746,0.15246172247546624
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices.

"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9573304,R01ES027747,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cadmium', 'Carbon', 'Carbon Black', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Membrane', 'Mercury', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'RNA marker', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Trace Elements', 'Translations', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vesicle', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'ambient air pollution', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'extracellular vesicles', 'follow-up', 'inflammatory marker', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2018,755603,0.010411492765826593
"Spatiotemporal Risk Assessment Modeling of Chemical Mixtures Project Summary: Comprehensive exposure assessments that account for mixtures of environmental chemical pollutants are vital to understand true relationships between human exposures and disease outcomes. Moreover, human or daily mobility of people is often misrepresented by exposure models resulting in exposure misclassification. This proposal aims to determine how air pollution chemical mixtures and human mobility impact environmental and human health risk assessments, which aligns with the NIEHS core mission “to discover how the environment affects people in order to promote healthier lives.” The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. The primary mentor, Dr. Kim Anderson, a professor at Oregon State University is an expert in passive exposure assessment methods and analytical quantification of chemical mixtures in environmental media, which provides an excellent environment to transition the candidate from a background in single-pollutant exposure assessment to multi-pollutant mixture exposure and risk assessment. Along with new teaching opportunities, the candidate will receive training from Dr. Anderson in research methods such as primary data collection, biochemical monitoring for epidemiological studies, and toxicology approaches in risk assessment. Collaborators Drs. Katrina Waters and Justin Teeguarden, senior scientists at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, will provide career development advising and research training in areas such as data integration for epidemiology and toxicology studies and hands-on experience with large-scale computational resources. This proposal’s aims will address the following central hypotheses: (1) Accounting for chemical mixtures in exposure will produce synergistic health effects not observed by chemicals individually, and (2) Personal sampling and model-based exposure assessment accounting for human mobility will produce varying risk estimates depending on the pollutant and individuals’ mobility. During the K99 phase, aim 1 will collect multi-chemical air quality data for a daily time resolved stationary monitoring campaign resulting in a space and time resolved multi-pollutant (Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds) air quality dataset. Aim 2 will develop spatiotemporal exposure models for gas-phase mixtures using land use regression, geostatistical, and machine learning models. In the R00 phase, aim 3 will perform a risk assessment for chemical mixtures and acute lung health effects accounting for human mobility using a case-crossover design and comparing three exposure assessment methods: traditional spatiotemporal models, spatiotemporal models accounting for human mobility, and personal exposure monitors. Together, this proposal addresses the major limitations in environmental exposure assessment, pollutant mixtures and human mobility, and is within the mixtures and air pollution focus areas of environmental exposure research at NIEHS. Project Narrative The goals of the candidate are to gain training and research experience towards becoming an independent principal investigator, developing an extramurally funded research lab, and conducting research focused on spatiotemporal exposure and risk assessment modeling. This study will validate spatiotemporal statistical approaches in chemical mixture exposure modelling, evaluate the cumulative effects of chemical mixtures in air pollution and acute lung health effects, and determine the extent of exposure misclassification due to human mobility.

"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices1-4. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children5-7. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes8-10. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides11. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures12,13, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized14,15. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid16. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California17-20, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind21,22, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics23 to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,9598047,K99ES028743,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,K99,2018,81281,-0.0030976036873985504
"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,9707680,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individual response', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory colonization', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2018,49524,0.14709612625147975
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9571016,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data management', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2018,12971526,0.09608036203591792
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes.

"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9540891,K99ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2018,88012,0.0909709504874816
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9494372,F31ES028081,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxins', 'Normalcy', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Poison', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure of nail of toe', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Welding', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'air sampling', 'base', 'cohort', 'exposed human population', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.010065709225887377
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9514218,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,182298,0.06825132283150166
"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth.

"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs. This proposal addresses the NIOSH cross-sector programs in Musculoskeletal Disorders as well as in Exposure Assessment. This translational research is in concurrence with the Research to Practice (r2P) initiative by developing technology to disseminate knowledge from recent NIOSH sponsored prospective studies on MSDs.

"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome,9592939,RC2DK118619,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bile duct carcinoma', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Databases', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'High Performance Computing', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Institution', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Disease', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Network-based', 'Norway', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'pollutant', 'primary outcome', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'tool', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,RC2,2018,1622560,0.05113384082374951
"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population. The kHealth system uses multiple sensors, mobile application and intelligent, personalized processing to predict health risks associated with asthma in children to develop a preventative and proactive approach to asthma management.",SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care,9526514,R01HD087132,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Albuterol', 'Algorithms', 'Ambrosia', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Big Data', 'Biological Sciences', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clupeidae', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dust', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Environmental Wind', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Finding by Cause', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inhalators', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nebulizer', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Notification', 'Office Visits', 'Ontology', 'Ozone', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perception', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pollen', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Serinus', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'asthma prevention', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'grass pollen', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'member', 'men', 'mid-career faculty', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'operation', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'sound', 'statistics', 'treatment guidelines', 'tree pollen', 'trend', 'web services']",NICHD,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,295924,0.1240576306959947
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions.

"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions.

"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification. This is particularly important for science, given the fact that students from high- poverty schools are economically disadvantaged and may comprise a large proportion of individuals from minority groups that are underrepresented in science.",Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram,9458539,R25ES028974,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Case Study', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High School Faculty', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'K-12 Faculty', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Predisposition', 'Program Development', 'Program Evaluation', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'STEM career', 'School Teachers', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Teaching Method', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'apprenticeship', 'base', 'college', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'design', 'environmental stressor', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'exposure route', 'health literacy', 'health science research', 'high school program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experience', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pedagogical content', 'programs', 'response', 'science teacher', 'skills', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'stressor', 'summer research', 'teacher', 'tool']",NIEHS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2018,99506,0.02360265457340757
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric.

"A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A Data Science Approach to Air Toxics and Children's Environmental Health,9313526,K99ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K99,2017,96716,0.014068541642154512
"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,9259911,R01AI118833,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Impairment', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epidemiologic data', 'forest', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,841388,0.15246172247546624
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health.

"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9212418,R01ES027747,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cadmium', 'Carbon', 'Carbon Black', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Membrane', 'Mercury', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'RNA marker', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Trace Elements', 'Translations', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vesicle', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'ambient air pollution', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'extracellular vesicles', 'follow-up', 'inflammatory marker', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2017,792334,0.010411492765826593
"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,9395534,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Smoking', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2017,49044,0.14709612625147975
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9404235,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2017,991019,0.09608036203591792
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9381203,K99ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune System and Related Disorders', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K99,2017,94114,0.0909709504874816
"Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome diseases in the United States. However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers and clinicians often use more easily available but potentially inconsistent ways to determine asthma status, such as review of diagnostic billing codes. This results in varied cohorts of people defined as having asthma that are associated with inconsistent study outcomes in asthma such as risk of asthma or asthma control. We will use natural language processing, a computer based search of electronic medical records (clinical notes), to efficiently determine who has asthma, what kind of asthma, and the onset of recognizable asthma symptoms that identify asthma efficiently, accurately, and consistently. An algorithm that robustly ascertains the status of asthma, and by extension possibly other chronic diseases, will accelerate scientific discoveries on asthma, enhance translation of research findings into clinical practice, and ultimately improve patient care.",Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records,9246341,R01HL126667,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'ICD-9', 'Information Centers', 'Information Retrieval', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence based guidelines', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'longitudinal dataset', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2017,377370,0.14586322589692322
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9328902,F31ES028081,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxins', 'Normalcy', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Poison', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Welding', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'air sampling', 'base', 'cohort', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,44044,0.010065709225887377
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9189610,R00ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2017,248999,0.05027067702003164
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9354508,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapy development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,201353,0.06825132283150166

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,9253392,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Education', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium', 'translation to humans']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2017,1728654,0.08799314834393036

"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9341310,R21ES027878,"['Address', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Circulation', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Collection', 'Conceptus', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Placenta', 'Placental Biology', 'Placentation', 'Plasticizers', 'Plastics', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Procedures', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Syncytiotrophoblast', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Uterine cavity', 'Villous', 'age effect', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytotrophoblast', 'design', 'developmental toxicology', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personal care products', 'phthalates', 'postnatal', 'prospective', 'response', 'study population', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2017,191131,0.030810431229034797
"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs. This proposal addresses the NIOSH cross-sector programs in Musculoskeletal Disorders as well as in Exposure Assessment. This translational research is in concurrence with the Research to Practice (r2P) initiative by developing technology to disseminate knowledge from recent NIOSH sponsored prospective studies on MSDs.

"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",9284482,K23ES023700,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Bronchi', 'Byssinosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Closed Cohort Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Critical Care', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endotoxins', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gossypium', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Institution', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Silk', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'airway epithelium', 'asthmatic', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'bronchial epithelium', 'career', 'career development', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'data mining', 'differential expression', 'disorder subtype', 'elementary school', 'environmental endotoxin', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory lung disease', 'inner city', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'patient oriented research', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'symposium', 'transcriptome']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2017,152840,0.07769078404168726
"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population. The kHealth system uses multiple sensors, mobile application and intelligent, personalized processing to predict health risks associated with asthma in children to develop a preventative and proactive approach to asthma management.",SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care,9294106,R01HD087132,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Albuterol', 'Algorithms', 'Ambrosia', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Big Data', 'Biological Sciences', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cereals', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clupeidae', 'Coal', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Coughing', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Dust', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Environmental Wind', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Finding by Cause', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Communication', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Humidity', 'Hydrocarbons', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Inhalators', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nebulizer', 'Nitric Oxide', 'Notification', 'Office Visits', 'Ontology', 'Ozone', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pollen', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Serinus', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'asthma prevention', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'digital', 'empowered', 'empowerment', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'grass pollen', 'handheld mobile device', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'member', 'men', 'mid-career faculty', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'operation', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'sensor', 'sound', 'statistics', 'tree pollen', 'trend', 'web services']",NICHD,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,338661,0.1240576306959947
"Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that almost one-half of Americans suffer from chronic diseases, yet epidemiologic investigations are limited by the difficulty of ascertaining disease status at scale, even in the era of electronic medical records (EMRs). For example, algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) for asthma lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies, while manual medical record reviews of EMRs are labor-intensive and thus inefficient for population-scale ascertainment of disease status. The lack of efficient ways to ascertain disease status has severely restricted the scope of investigation for chronic diseases such as asthma. Furthermore, there is a temporal progression of a patient's true disease status, and this may not be reflected in the clinical diagnosis of that disease. We previously reported that two-thirds of children with asthma had a delay in their diagnosis (median: 3.3 years), with subsequent conditions like remission or relapse largely unreported. Such information about disease progression may be recorded during manual medical record review, but, again, manual review limits investigations and conclusions to small-scale studies. Our long term goal is to accelerate epidemiological investigations of chronic diseases and their temporal progression by streamlining medical record review. The main goal of this proposal is to extend a preliminary NLP-based system for asthma status ascertainment by identifying time-situated classifications of asthma onset, remission, and relapse. We will validate this system in a population health setting and release it as an open-source tool. We hypothesize that NLP methods in the EMR allow us to ascertain asthma status and to track asthma disease progression with greater accuracy and efficiency than conventional approaches (billing codes or manual medical record review). In Aim 1, we will extend our preliminary NLP system to ascertain the patient-level disease progression of asthma. Most significantly, we will ascertain time-situated asthma remission and relapse, two important events in the natural history of asthma. We will also improve methods of aggregating events, employ temporal expression and relation extraction, include structured data sources, and implement automatic feature selection. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the NLP system for its accuracy in ascertaining asthma onset, relapse, and remission. We will also verify the epidemiological (construct) validity against existing studies, and disseminate the NLP system as an open-source project, Adept (Aggregation of Disease Evidence for Patient Timelines). Expected Outcomes: The proposed NLP system will: (i) orient clinical NLP techniques toward time-situated patient-level solutions; (ii) expand the scale of research capabilities for asthma; and (iii) provide a basis for decision support and other applications. Successful completion of this project would provide an open-source tool for ascertaining the disease progression of asthma with a general approach to aggregating evidence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children, yet studying asthma in large populations is difficult because it is costly to read through medical records to determine who has asthma and when they got it. We aim to use electronic medical records (especially clinical notes) to efficiently determine who has asthma and track its progression over time. An algorithm that tracks disease status over time will potentially enable further research on chronic diseases, and will ultimately improve patient care.",Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing,8995191,R21AI116839,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'ICD-9', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'open source', 'population based', 'population health', 'response', 'tool']",NIAID,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2016,238500,0.08961656349242492
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health.

"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.            ",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,9062381,R01AI118833,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epidemiologic data', 'forest', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,819475,0.15246172247546624

We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.            ",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,9152652,R01AI118833,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'candidate marker', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epidemiologic data', 'forest', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'pathogen', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,20798,0.15246172247546624
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,9124954,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'concussive symptom', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'meetings', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'mood symptom', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'persistent symptom', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,347813,0.02060357937864941
"Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome diseases in the United States. However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers and clinicians often use more easily available but potentially inconsistent ways to determine asthma status, such as review of diagnostic billing codes. This results in varied cohorts of people defined as having asthma that are associated with inconsistent study outcomes in asthma such as risk of asthma or asthma control. We will use natural language processing, a computer based search of electronic medical records (clinical notes), to efficiently determine who has asthma, what kind of asthma, and the onset of recognizable asthma symptoms that identify asthma efficiently, accurately, and consistently. An algorithm that robustly ascertains the status of asthma, and by extension possibly other chronic diseases, will accelerate scientific discoveries on asthma, enhance translation of research findings into clinical practice, and ultimately improve patient care.",Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records,9032521,R01HL126667,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'ICD-9', 'Information Retrieval', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'evidence based guidelines', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2016,383120,0.14586322589692322
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9197901,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Fetus', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Proxy', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'trafficking', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,199585,0.06825132283150166
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",9026614,R00ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'abstracting', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2016,248999,0.05027067702003164
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,9044557,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health education', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health science research', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2016,1729509,0.08799314834393036
"Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures Project Summary/Abstract  The placenta is an essential organ in human development, and disruption of its function can result in problems in pregnancy including miscarriage, preterm labor, preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Additionally, disrupted placenta function during pregnancy has been associated with a great number of disorders and diseases that do not present until much later in the offspring's life such as metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, developmental delay and other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders. How the exposures encountered in the environment drive alterations in placenta structure and function is poorly understood, and placenta function is difficult to assess in vivo using noninvasive methods. We propose to understand how gene expression is altered in the placenta during gestation by noninvasively characterizing the placenta transcriptome in association with exposure to chemicals known to alter endocrine signaling. These chemicals, called phthalates, are commonly found in a variety of commercial products such as plastics and personal care products, and phthalate exposure has also been shown to effect neurodevelopment. The link between phthalate exposure and placenta gene expression in vivo is not yet clear; therefore we have assembled a team comprised of neuroscientists, placenta biologists, environmental epidemiologists, and genomics experts do address how phthalate exposure and gestational age effects gene that are expressed in the placenta but not in other tissues. One of the advantages of the proposed research is that we will assess placenta gene expression noninvasively through RNA molecules contained in extracellular vesicles that are secreted into the urine of pregnant women. Collecting gene expression data and chemical exposure data from urine is highly clinically relevant, and we expect our approach will have clear translational applications just as home pregnancy tests that rely on the detection of placenta produced hormones in urine have become common. Our proposed study will provide the basic science background for the development of rapid, noninvasive tests for assessing placenta function, chemical exposures, and ultimately problems in neurodevelopment and other danger signals during pregnancy. Project Narrative  The proposed research will collect genome wide placenta gene expression data from 50 pregnant women at three time points during gestation. In addition to assessing gene expression differences the proposed research will develop methods to noninvasively determine placenta-originating transcripts among all transcripts existing in the urine of pregnant women. The proposed research will also compare gene expression to endocrine disrupting chemicals known to cause health problems.",Placental RNA Expression as a Function of Gestational Age and Environmental Exposures,9197555,R21ES027878,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Archives', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Circulation', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Collection', 'Conceptus', 'Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Illinois', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Placenta', 'Placentation', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Tests', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Labor', 'Procedures', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small RNA', 'Source', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Stromal Cells', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Syncytiotrophoblast', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Uterine cavity', 'Villous', 'abstracting', 'age effect', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytotrophoblast', 'design', 'developmental toxicology', 'extracellular vesicles', 'genome-wide', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personal care products', 'phthalates', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'response', 'study population', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2016,245727,0.030810431229034797
"Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches ABSTRACT Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. Proper treatment of data types emerging from a diverse set of molecular and environmental profiling technologies cannot be analyzed using traditional statistical routines and new computational approaches are needed. In line with the President's Precision Medicine Initiative, the goal of this proposal is to develop computational methods and integrate large- scale genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect preterm birth (PTB) in diverse populations. Preterm birth, or the delivery of an infant prior to 37 weeks of gestation, is a major health concern. Infants born prematurely, comprising of about 12% of the US newborns, have elevated risks of neonatal mortality and a wide array of health problems. Preterm birth rates vary among different ethnic groups, with frequencies significantly elevated in African Americans and moderately elevated in Hispanics in comparison to Europeans. Environmental and socioeconomic factors alone may not explain these disparities and despite the evidence for a genetic basis to preterm birth, to date no causal genetic variants have been identified. In this proposal I aim to leverage the rich genetic and environmental variation data and develop computational approaches to advance our understanding of biology of preterm birth as it relates to all populations. To that extent, I propose three aims. In aim 1, I will develop computational methods to identify and validate novel genetic factors for preterm birth by genome-wide association (GWA) study in diverse ethnic populations. I obtained a comprehensive set of publicly available PTB case and control datasets consisting of ethnically diverse mothers and babies including 3,500 cases and nearly 16,000 controls from dbGAP and will carry out an ancestry-based case-control GWA study to identify genetic factors influencing PTB. In aim 2, I will develop analytical methodology to identify environmental and socioeconomic factors that impact preterm birth in diverse ethnic populations. I propose to integrate linked California State databases covering over 3 million births across diverse populations with geographical location data and pollution levels and UV exposure data from the Environmental Protection Agency in order to identify whether these exposures play a role in contributing to population-specific PTB risk. In aim 3, I will carry out integrative data analysis and build computational models in order to identify population specific interactions between the genetic and environmental factors affecting PTB risk. I hypothesize that gene-environment interactions contribute to population differences in preterm birth risk following environmental exposures. The proposed work will allow us to learn more about the etiology PTB, but could also be extended to other phenotypes of interest. This project is the logical next step for the study of the interaction of genetics and environment in the context of disease, which can be used to inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the wealth and availability of genomic and environmental exposure data, computational methods provide a powerful opportunity to identify population-specific determinants of disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop computational approaches to integrate diverse genetic and environmental exposure datasets to elucidate factors that affect disease in diverse populations and apply them to the study of preterm birth. The methodology developed as part of this proposal can be extended and applied to other phenotypes of interest and inform precise population-specific diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",Elucidating the Role of the Genetic and Environmental Determinants of Preterm Birth Using Integrative Computational Approaches,9163426,K01LM012381,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Air Pollution', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Birth Rate', 'California', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Ecology', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Family', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Low Prevalence', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Neonatology', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nutrient', 'Particulate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Training Activity', 'Twin Studies', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Variant', 'Work', 'admixture mapping', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'economic cost', 'ethnic diversity', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'interest', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic', 'statistics']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2016,176920,0.06059437534736123
"A Direct Reading Video Assessment Instrument for Repetitive Motion Stress Project Summary/ Abstract This research studies if computer vision can more effectively evaluate worker exposure and assess the associated risk for work related injuries than conventional methods. Current methods involve either observations or measurements using instruments attached to a worker's hands or arms. Observation is often considered too subjective or inaccurate, and instruments too invasive or time consuming for routine applications in industry. Automated job analysis potentially offers a more objective, accurate, repeatable, and efficient exposure assessment tool than observational analysis. Computer vision uses less resources than instruments attached to workers and does not interfere with production; can quantify more exposure variables and interactions; is suitable for long-term, direct reading exposure assessment; and offers animated data visualizations synchronized with video for identifying aspects of jobs needing interventions. This research leverages the research from coordinated multi-institutional prospective studies of upper limb work related MSD conducted between 2001 and 2010 that studied production and service workers from a variety of US industries, and used rigorous case-criteria and individual-level exposure assessments prospectively, including recording detailed videos of the work. Our study partners from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Washington State Labor & Industries Safety & Health Assessment & Research for Prevention program and the University of California-San Francisco will provide task-level videos, associated exposure variable data, and prospective health outcomes for 1,649 workers. Exposure properties directly measured from videos of jobs and corresponding health outcomes from the prospective study database will establish dose-response relationships to translate into a prototype automated job analysis instrument. We build on our previous success in developing video marker-less hand motion algorithms for estimating the ACGIH hand activity level, and reliable video processing methods for hand tracking under challenging viewing conditions. This proposal will refine and develop additional video algorithms, and analyze the videos to extract exposure measures for repetition, posture, exertions, and their interactions. The video extracted exposure measures will be compared against conventional observational exposure measures made by our collaborators. Video and corresponding observational data will be merged with the prospective health outcomes data to evaluate dose-response and to develop and validate parsimonious exposure risk models for an automated direct reading repetitive motion instrument. We will test if automation has better predictive capability than observation and also consider the accuracy and utility of computer vision analysis against conventional job analysis for selected industrial jobs. This proposal addresses the NIOSH cross-sector programs in Musculoskeletal Disorders as well as in Exposure Assessment. This translational research is in concurrence with the Research to Practice (r2P) initiative by developing technology to disseminate knowledge from recent NIOSH sponsored prospective studies on MSDs.

"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",9066670,K23ES023700,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Bronchi', 'Burn injury', 'Byssinosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Closed Cohort Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Critical Care', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endotoxins', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gossypium', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Silk', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway epithelium', 'asthmatic', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'bronchial epithelium', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'data mining', 'differential expression', 'disorder subtype', 'elementary school', 'environmental endotoxin', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'genomic data', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory lung disease', 'inner city', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'overexpression', 'patient oriented research', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'symposium', 'transcriptome', 'trend']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2016,152840,0.07769078404168726
"SCH: kHealth: Semantic Multisensory Mobile Approach to Personalized Asthma Care ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): The proliferation of smartphones and sensors has made continuous monitoring of physiology, environment, and public health notifications possible. However, personalized digital health and patient empowerment will become reality only if massive multisensory and multimodal observational data is processed within patient context and made actionable to enable early detection; better diagnosis, effective prevention and treatment of the disease; and improve the quality of life. This research will be performed in the context of asthma, which affects 300 million people and claims over 250,000 lives worldwide annually. According to CDC, 9.3% of US children have asthma. Understanding asthma and its management is challenging; it is a multifactorial disease with subjective causes and symptoms, and extant diagnosis and treatment guidelines can be improved using evidence-based action recommendation. With the advent of mobile and connected sensors, timely information about asthma triggers has become available, and its exploitation requires precisely understanding and quantifying the sensed data's role for preventive and proactive assessment of asthma. In this application led by computer scientists and a practicing clinician, we address the central problem of deriving actionable information from data monitored using kHealth technology. Through a pilot study, we have tested our kHealth kit equipped on several pediatric patients under the guidance of a clinical doctor for reliable data collection and patient operation, with promising initial results. We build on this foundation by addressing the problem of semantic representation, integration, abstraction, and personalized interpretation of heterogeneous observations spanning physiological, environmental data, and online data in the context of medical knowledge. Our primary hypothesis is that an evidence-based approach to asthma can help doctors determine more precisely the cause, severity and control of asthma, and can alert patients to seek timely clinical assistance to better manage asthma. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This application direclty relates to NICHD mission of improving health of children, with focus on asthma that affects a significant population.

"Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that almost one-half of Americans suffer from chronic diseases, yet epidemiologic investigations are limited by the difficulty of ascertaining disease status at scale, even in the era of electronic medical records (EMRs). For example, algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) for asthma lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies, while manual medical record reviews of EMRs are labor-intensive and thus inefficient for population-scale ascertainment of disease status. The lack of efficient ways to ascertain disease status has severely restricted the scope of investigation for chronic diseases such as asthma. Furthermore, there is a temporal progression of a patient's true disease status, and this may not be reflected in the clinical diagnosis of that disease. We previously reported that two-thirds of children with asthma had a delay in their diagnosis (median: 3.3 years), with subsequent conditions like remission or relapse largely unreported. Such information about disease progression may be recorded during manual medical record review, but, again, manual review limits investigations and conclusions to small-scale studies. Our long term goal is to accelerate epidemiological investigations of chronic diseases and their temporal progression by streamlining medical record review. The main goal of this proposal is to extend a preliminary NLP-based system for asthma status ascertainment by identifying time-situated classifications of asthma onset, remission, and relapse. We will validate this system in a population health setting and release it as an open-source tool. We hypothesize that NLP methods in the EMR allow us to ascertain asthma status and to track asthma disease progression with greater accuracy and efficiency than conventional approaches (billing codes or manual medical record review). In Aim 1, we will extend our preliminary NLP system to ascertain the patient-level disease progression of asthma. Most significantly, we will ascertain time-situated asthma remission and relapse, two important events in the natural history of asthma. We will also improve methods of aggregating events, employ temporal expression and relation extraction, include structured data sources, and implement automatic feature selection. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the NLP system for its accuracy in ascertaining asthma onset, relapse, and remission. We will also verify the epidemiological (construct) validity against existing studies, and disseminate the NLP system as an open-source project, Adept (Aggregation of Disease Evidence for Patient Timelines). Expected Outcomes: The proposed NLP system will: (i) orient clinical NLP techniques toward time-situated patient-level solutions; (ii) expand the scale of research capabilities for asthma; and (iii) provide a basis for decision support and other applications. Successful completion of this project would provide an open-source tool for ascertaining the disease progression of asthma with a general approach to aggregating evidence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children, yet studying asthma in large populations is difficult because it is costly to read through medical records to determine who has asthma and when they got it. We aim to use electronic medical records (especially clinical notes) to efficiently determine who has asthma and track its progression over time. An algorithm that tracks disease status over time will potentially enable further research on chronic diseases, and will ultimately improve patient care.                ",Enhanced Ascertainment of Asthma Status Via Natural Language Processing,8860691,R21AI116839,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'ICD-9', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Solutions', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'open source', 'population based', 'population health', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NIAID,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2015,198750,0.08961656349242492
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.

"Nasal biomarkers of asthma ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that affects 9.3% of children and 8.0% of adults in the US. Mild to moderate asthma can be difficult to diagnose and manage given waxing and waning symptoms. The airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation that underlie asthma are challenging to assess regularly and easily. Given the accessibility of the nose for assessment and monitoring, it is clinically and scientifically compelling to identify nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. To date, several lower airway pathogens have been associated with asthma. In separate studies, host gene expression in the airway has been associated with asthma. Host and microbes undoubtedly interact in asthma. A nasal biomarker that could accurately identify mild/moderate asthma and provide information on host vs. microbial contributions and their relative causality to disease would be highly useful for clinical care and research. We hypothesize that causal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma can be identified through network-based examination of nasal gene expression and microbiota. We will recruit subjects with mild/moderate asthma, severe asthma, and controls from whom we will generate the first paired system-wide profiles of host and microbiome in asthma. In Aim 1, we will focus on host characterization and identify nasal transcript biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma by RNA-sequence profiling of nasal brushings, differential gene expression analysis, and machine learning. In Aim 2, we will perform the first study of the nasal microbiome in asthma to identify nasal microbial biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma. We will generate 16S rRNA data from nasal swabs to identify bacterial taxa associated with mild/moderate asthma, apply metagenomic inference to ascertain their functions, perform metagenomic sequencing for identification of non-bacterial taxa, and apply machine learning to distinguish microbial classifiers of mild/moderate asthma. We will be the first to reconstruct bacterial functions associated with asthma through metagenomic inference, and the first to apply metagenomic sequencing to well- characterized asthmatics. In Aim 3, we will identify causal nasal biomarkers of mild/moderate asthma through data-driven, network approaches that integrate genetic, transcriptome, microbiome, and clinical data. We will link host to microbiome by constructing interaction networks, characterize the association between genetic variation and gene expression by eQTL detection, and infer causal drivers of mild/moderate asthma through Bayesian network construction. We will project asthma-specific subnetworks onto our networks, and compare our networks to those for other respiratory diseases to identify coherent modules of genes and microbes dysregulated in asthma. In all aims, we will assess for relevance to asthma more broadly by testing for the identified biomarkers in nasal and bronchial samples from severe asthmatics. We expect that our results will lead to the development of a nasal test that can be used for the clinical management and investigation of mild/moderate asthma, a prevalent disease that is currently suboptimally diagnosed and managed.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma impairs quality of life and leads to emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and sometimes death in people of all ages and walks of life. To identify noninvasive, predictive biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of asthma, we will comprehensively profile and examine nasal gene expression and the nasal microbial community in subjects with mild/moderate and severe asthma. We will use computational biology to construct networks that reflect the interactions and interconnectivity of host and microbes in asthma, and identify nasal biomarker candidates that we expect will lead to a nasal test for asthma.            ",Nasal biomarkers of asthma,8941822,R01AI118833,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Network-based', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA Sequences', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxon', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Waxes', 'airway inflammation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'computer based statistical methods', 'epidemiologic data', 'forest', 'fungus', 'genetic analysis', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'pathogen', 'public health relevance', 'reconstruction', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'virus identification']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,707364,0.15246172247546624
"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI's second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies. Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals' cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.",A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk,8876609,R01CA170508,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cancer Patient', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'High Performance Computing', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Individual Cancer History', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nomads', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'age group', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cyber security', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'environment related cancer', 'environmental carcinogenesis', 'experience', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'migration', 'novel', 'population migration', 'social', 'social networking website', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend', 'web site']",NCI,"UT-BATTELLE, LLC-OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LAB",R01,2015,392385,0.022169152698699165
"Integrative Genomics Approaches to Model the Genetic Architecture of Asthma ABSTRACT  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide,  results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have  searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding  of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture  underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating  multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR)  data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that  predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred  strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein  interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in  humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of  asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent  human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through  replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims,  we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma,  particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness. By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such  variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma.  Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a  clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.",Integrative Genomics Approaches to Model the Genetic Architecture of Asthma,8847988,R00HL105663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'insight', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'trait']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2015,221134,0.09228633681588905
"Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome disease in the United States. Despite this, epidemiologic investigations into childhood asthma are limited by variations in asthma diagnosis across sites and inefficient utilization of electronic medical records (EMRs) to facilitate large- scale studies. Algorithms based on structured data (e.g., ICD-9 codes) have shown strong specificity, but lack the sensitivity required for population-based studies for asthma. Manual EMR reviews allow application of well- recognized criteria-based definitions such as the Asthma Predictive Index (API) or the Predetermined Asthma Criteria (PAC), but are labor-intensive and expensive, and therefore not feasible for population-level studies. Because of the lack of consistent, reproducible, and efficient asthma ascertainment methods, the use of inconsistent a. asthma criteria, b. ascertainment processes, and c. sampling frames results in inconsistent asthma cohorts and study results for clinical trials or other studies. This inconsistency causes confusion, delayed translation of important study findings into clinical practice, and may obscure the true heterogeneity of asthma. Our long-term goal is to advance research and clinical care for asthma, by developing a robust software tool to streamline the process of automatic medical record ascertainment of asthma based on the asthma criteria (PAC and API). We propose to augment traditional structured data criteria with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to account for unstructured text. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for automating API, and apply the NLP algorithms for both PAC and API to identify a cohort of children with asthma. In addition, we will use the tools to characterize children with asthma thereby demonstrating its usefulness in epidemiological investigations and also possibly in asthma management. We hypothesize that asthma criteria-based NLP algorithms applied to the EMR will allow us to identify and characterize asthma status accurately, consistently, and efficiently. In Aim 1, we will develop NLP-API, an NLP algorithm for API. In Aim 2, we will apply both NLP-API (developed under Aim 1) and NLP-PAC (our recently developed PAC-based NLP algorithm) to two evaluation cohorts. In Aim 3, we will characterize the subgroups of children with asthma identified under Aim 2 by assessing the association of NLP-ascertained asthma status with lung function and biomarkers for asthma. The expected outcomes of the proposed study are: (i) enhanced research capabilities for asthma by enabling more consistent, reproducible, and efficient large-scale asthma ascertainment, sampling frames, and timing estimations; (ii) a basis for improving timely asthma diagnosis and care through clinical decision support systems; and (iii) advancement of the use of NLP techniques for clinical studies. Successful completion of this project will provide an accurate, consistent, and efficient tool for addressing the significant burden of asthma in children and a framework for extension to other chronic diseases and adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is the most common chronic condition in children and one of the five most burdensome diseases in the United States. However, conducting research on and developing quality improvement initiatives around asthma management at the population level is difficult, primarily due to the inconsistent identification of who has asthma and who doesn't. Identification of asthma status from review of medical records is very time consuming and expensive. Thus, researchers and clinicians often use more easily available but potentially inconsistent ways to determine asthma status, such as review of diagnostic billing codes. This results in varied cohorts of people defined as having asthma that are associated with inconsistent study outcomes in asthma such as risk of asthma or asthma control. We will use natural language processing, a computer based search of electronic medical records (clinical notes), to efficiently determine who has asthma, what kind of asthma, and the onset of recognizable asthma symptoms that identify asthma efficiently, accurately, and consistently. An algorithm that robustly ascertains the status of asthma, and by extension possibly other chronic diseases, will accelerate scientific discoveries on asthma, enhance translation of research findings into clinical practice, and ultimately improve patient care.            ",Asthma ascertainment and characterization through electronic health records,8853379,R01HL126667,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'ICD-9', 'Information Retrieval', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Manuals', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'evidence based guidelines', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NHLBI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2015,388870,0.14586322589692322
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows Abstract: Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking. Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (PI) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals. By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 proposal builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health. In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study. Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities. Narrative: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking. Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This proposal will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",8992934,R00ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'abstracting', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R00,2015,248999,0.05027067702003164
"Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS): Data and Software Coordination and Integration Center (DSCIC) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS), a new program initiated by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), aims to develop sensor-based integrated health monitoring systems to serve as research tools to measure pediatric environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in epidemiological studies of asthma, and eventually other chronic diseases, in the pediatric population. To address the critical need to create a central data and software resource for integrating and facilitating access, analysis, and dissemination of data and software generated within the PRISMS program, we are proposing the University of Southern California PRISMS Data and Software Coordination and Integration Center (USC PRISMS DSCIC). Our team will work closely with the other two arms of PRISMS to coordinate and integrate outputs from the program's informatics platform centers that collect, analyze and present data from pediatric sensor-based health monitoring systems with an initial focus on pediatric asthma. We will ultimately address significant data science and tool development challenges associated with integrated monitoring systems datasets to enable important advances in our understanding of environmental determinants of pediatric asthma. Our proposal is structured around the four main research objectives specified in the RFA: 1) Integrated Knowledge Environment; 2) Data Integration; 3) Collaborative Environments and Technologies; and 4) Unified Access to PRISMS PTC Resources. The team is led by Co-PIs Drs. Jose Luis Ambite and Frank Gilliland at USC. Outdoor air pollution at levels occurring in many urban areas around the world has substantial adverse effects on health. Children in general, and children with asthma in particular, are sensitive to the adverse effects of outdoor air pollutants, includin ozone, nitrogen oxides, and respirable particulate matter. The prevalence of asthma in the U.S. increased from 7.3% in 2001 to 8.4% in 2010, while children aged 0-17 years had asthma prevalence of 9.5%, compared to adults aged 18 and over at 7.7%, for the period 2008-2010. Consistent with the increased vulnerability of children, a large and growing number of studies show that children living near traffic or high levels of ozone, nitrogen dioxide, or PM have increased risks of adverse respiratory effects, such as new-onset asthma, asthma symptoms, exacerbations, school absences, and asthma-related hospitalizations. Ongoing studies also show that genetic variations in antioxidant and inflammatory genes play a role in ozone susceptibility. New methods in big data science are providing powerful tools for confronting critical research questions in asthma, in a range of areas from genomics to health informatics to environmental research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pediatric Research using Integrated Sensor Monitoring Systems (PRISMS), a new program initiated by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), aims to develop sensor-based integrated health monitoring systems to serve as research tools to measure pediatric environmental, physiological, and behavioral factors in epidemiological studies of asthma, and eventually other chronic diseases, in the pediatric population.

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,8832593,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health education', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health science research', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2015,1735289,0.08799314834393036
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology. Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8874981,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2015,377291,0.020626547209282173
"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",8852128,K23ES023700,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Bronchi', 'Burn injury', 'Byssinosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Closed Cohort Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Critical Care', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endotoxins', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gossypium', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Silk', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway epithelium', 'asthmatic', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'bronchial epithelium', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'data mining', 'differential expression', 'disorder subtype', 'elementary school', 'environmental endotoxin', 'experience', 'individualized medicine', 'inflammatory lung disease', 'inner city', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented research', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'symposium', 'trend']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2015,152840,0.07769078404168726
"White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices is common in recent military personnel from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clinicians and experts have established minimum symptom criteria for diagnosis of mild TBI including altered sensorium (e.g. feeling dazed and confused), loss of consciousness (LOC), and amnesia following exposure to blast or impact. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated that these symptoms are associated with white matter damage. However, little attention has been given to investigating white matter following asymptomatic exposure to repetitive blast. Relatedly, several recent studies report white matter damage in elite athletes following repetitive impacts despite the absence of concussive symptoms.  Our goal is to assess damage to white matter and impairments in cognitive performance in recent military personnel with primary blast exposure without clinical symptoms of TBI (subconcussive blast exposure).  Animal models of blast support systemic mechanisms of white matter damage such as neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic processes that are likely to result in diffuse and widespread tissue injury that is spatially heterogeneous among affected individuals. We will use methods for quantifying spatially heterogeneous damage to white matter damage that are more sensitive than conventional voxelwise or region-of-interest approaches. We anticipate comparable white matter damage in a subconcussive blast exposed group and a mild TBI group that will be significantly greater than in blast- unexposed subjects. We will use a machine learning approach to generalize knowledge about the magnitude of white matter in clinically established cases of mild TBI. We will then test this knowledge (validation) to make diagnostic predictions for new cases, particularly blast-exposed individuals, who lack a clinical diagnosis of TBI.  We will assess the association between spatially distributed injury to white matter and other measures including, gray matter volume, resting-state functional connectivity, cognitive performance, and symptoms of PTSD and depression. If we confirm our key predictions that tissue damage, cognitive impairment, and functional quality of life changes result from subconcussive blast exposure, it would argue for an augmentation of the established approach for making clinical symptom-based diagnoses of mild TBI with neuroimaging-based diagnostic criteria. The results would further imply that many blast-exposed individuals with chronic symptoms (e.g. mood symptoms, fatigue, inattention) are being incorrectly diagnosed with other conditions (e.g. depression, PTSD) in the absence of acute clinical diagnosis of TBI. Validation of our approach on a large scale including translation to civilian subconcussive exposure (e.g. sports), would argue for implementing advanced diffusion imaging and analytic techniques in the clinical setting.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The majority of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases from recent military conflicts involve exposure to explosive forces (primary blast) emanating from bombs and other devices. Whereas, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) has demonstrated disruption of brain tissue in cases that meet the minimum symptom criteria for clinical diagnosis of mild TBI, the consequences of blast exposure that is insufficient to meet these criteria is unknown.  We will investigate damage resulting to brain tissue from exposure to ""subconcussive"" blast.            ",White Matter Damage in Subconcussive Blast Exposure,8815240,R01NS086885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Afghanistan', 'Amnesia', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain', 'Chronic', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Feeling', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Iraq', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Moods', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Sports', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'executive function', 'gray matter', 'inattention', 'interest', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,344166,0.02060357937864941
"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,8688300,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2014,1919404,0.08536631959010982
"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA ABSTRACT  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide,  results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have  searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding  of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture  underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating  multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR)  data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that  predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred  strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein  interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in  humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of  asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent  human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through  replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims,  we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma,  particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness. By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such  variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma.  Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a  clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA,8727091,R00HL105663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'insight', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R00,2014,80611,0.09228633681588905
"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials. Project Narrative  Innovative predictive modeling incorporating family history, genes, environmental exposures, and geneenvironment interactions, is a key step in the progress towards an RA prevention clinical trial.","Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk",8664806,K24AR052403,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Exogenous Hormone Therapy', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Grant', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Healthcare', 'ICD-9', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'PTPN22 gene', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phenotype', 'Pollution', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT4 gene', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Smoking', 'Sushi Domain', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'TNF receptor-associated factor 1', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive modeling', 'prevention clinical trial', 'programs', 'research study', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'trafficking']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2014,157939,0.04671618872333662
"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking.  Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (principal investigator) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting-edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals.  By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 application builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health.  In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study.  Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities.         Public Health Relevance: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking.  Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This application will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8691819,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2014,373821,0.020626547209282173
"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.          Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals� cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,8516556,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2013,1864564,0.08536631959010982
"Clustering to identify novel phenotypes in childhood asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood asthma is a heterogeneous disease. This is evident given the broad range of clinical characteristics and treatment responses for children defined as asthmatic. Current classification systems for asthma phenotypes are inadequate to fully understand the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes of asthma.  Given the heterogeneous nature of asthma, novel ensemble clustering of childhood asthma using data from five clinical trials is proposed. It is hypothesized these discovered phenotypes (or clusters) will have defining characteristics that suggest unique etiologies and appropriate treatment strategies. The aims are to (1) perform ensemble clustering of childhood asthma and describe characteristics for the observed phenotype, (2) develop a model to classify childhood asthma into the phenotypes previously defined in Aim (1), and (3) retrospectively determine whether childhood asthma phenotypes identified by ensemble clustering correlate with treatment responses in clinical trials. We expect (1) fewer than ten phenotypes to be identified with some attributes over- represented in each phenotype, (2) to develop a simple, easily interpretable classification model, and (3) to identify phenotypes for which clinical trial treatments were effective or ineffective.  On the path toward personalized medicine, novel research with ensemble clustering and a large dataset with clinical trial outcomes will advance the field by validating and hypothesizing childhood asthma pathogenesis, pathophysiology and treatment responses.        Childhood asthma is likely not a single disease, but rather a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes (or subtypes). Computational analysis can identify and elucidate the characteristics of these phenotypes. These phenotypes may provide insight into the causes of and appropriate treatments for asthma.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA ABSTRACT  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide,  results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have  searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding  of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture  underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating  multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR)  data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that  predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred  strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein  interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in  humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of  asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent  human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through  replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims,  we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma,  particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness. By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such  variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma.  Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a  clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.",INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA,8724089,R00HL105663,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Bronchodilator Agents', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genomics', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Inbred Strains Mice', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'insight', 'mouse development', 'mouse genome', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'trait']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R00,2013,237047,0.09228633681588905
"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials.

"Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        Mixtures are a common exposure scenario but are rarely studied. Metals comprise a class of chemicals to which co-exposure is common and whose neurotoxic effects, particularly, can be severe, making them a potentially paradigm class of chemicals for mixtures research. Research on individual metals, such as lead, has been robust; but research on metal mixtures is lacking.  Major challenges impeding progress in mixtures research include the lack of sufficient exposure data for multiple metals. Even when multiple metal exposure biomarkers are collected, there remains a lack of analytical tools to fully evaluate interactions. Under the mentorship of Drs. Coull and Lucchini, Dr. Claus Henn (principal investigator) will overcome barriers in mixtures research by using cutting-edge statistical learning methods, combined with robust data on host exposure to mixed metals.  By doing so, she will evaluate the joint effects of multiple metals on neurodevelopment. This K99/R00 application builds upon Dr. Claus Henn's experience in environmental epidemiology and exposure science to cross train her in child development and biostatistics and prepare her to become an independent investigator specializing in chemical mixtures and pediatric environmental health.  In the K99 phase of the award, Dr. Claus Henn will use tutorials, didactic instruction, and seminars/conferences to receive training in: 1) advanced quantitative methods for use in analyzing combined exposures, and 2) childhood neurodevelopment from the prenatal period through adolescence. These areas of training represent a new cross-disciplinary goal for Dr. Claus Henn. Her training will subsequently be applied in an existing cohort of 750 Italian adolescents in the Public Health Impact of Mixed Element exposure (PHIME) study.  Dr. Claus Henn will apply structural equation models, random forests, and kernel regression machines to examine cognitive effects of concurrent exposure to combinations of metals. In the R00 phase, Dr. Claus Henn will evaluate whether cognitive effects of exposure to combinations of metals depend on exposure timing. Using data from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to Environmental NeuroToxicants (ELEMENT) longitudinal birth cohort, she will apply the aforementioned methods at multiple exposure time points, across the prenatal period and childhood. This cross-disciplinary proposal represents a unique opportunity to efficiently use existing data in an innovative yet cost-effective manner. The proposed training and research will provide Dr. Claus Henn with the skills to study the joint effects of multiple chemicals and multiple time points on neurodevelopment in future research. This research will 1) address the large data gap on health effects of chemical mixtures, and 2) help characterize critical windows of susceptibility to neurotoxicants; both are NIEHS strategic goals and public health priorities.         Public Health Relevance: Research on chemical mixtures is a critical public health need, because the neurotoxicity of an individual chemical is likely modified in the presence of other chemicals; yet research on the effects of metal mixtures is lacking.  Further complicating this issue is that timing of exposure to mixtures may also result in differential toxicity. This application will use an integrated training plan in neurodevelopment and advanced biostatistics to train Dr. Birgit Claus Henn, an environmental epidemiologist and exposure assessment expert, to conduct high-level research in metal mixtures and children's neurodevelopment at several critical time points of development, from the prenatal period through adolescence.                ","Metal mixtures, children's cognition, and sensitive developmental windows",8566379,K99ES022986,"['13 year old', '4 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Body Burden', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hair', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Italy', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Perinatal Exposure', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'analytical tool', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'deciduous tooth', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'forest', 'innovation', 'lead exposure', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'public health priorities', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2013,102242,0.05059140887067339

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.  Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity. Current research in this area is hampered by the lack of convenient tests to measure early mitochondrial damage, which would promote appropriate preventive/treatment efforts for individuals and at risk populations. The goal of this research is to identify chemical changes in blood or urine that are indicators of mitochondrial damage in the body, using mass spectrometry tools to survey thousands of compounds.",Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting,8484404,R01ES020819,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioenergetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dose', 'Electron Transport', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fumarates', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Genomics', 'Glutathione', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Hypoxia', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Length', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Mitochondrial Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Organelles', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Populations at Risk', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preventive', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Staging', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Succinates', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Urine', 'Vitamin A', 'Vitamin A Deficiency', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'environmental stressor', 'environmental toxicology', 'extracellular', 'high risk', 'human population study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'nucleotide metabolism', 'organic acid', 'phenyl ether', 'pollutant', 'protein misfolding', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'statistics', 'tool', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2013,370345,0.020626547209282173
"Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Research Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. Endotoxin is almost universally present, and has been found at high levels in tobacco smoke, homes burning biomass fuel, in the context of various occupations especially cotton textile work, and more recently as part of indoor air pollution in schools. We do not fully understand how endotoxin can lead to development or worsening of asthma and COPD. Recent technologic advances have allowed one to simultaneously identify changes in expression of over 14K genes using microarrays. Studies comparing gene expression changes from invasive samples taken from the bronchi (lower airways) and non- invasive samples from the nose (upper airways) have shown many similarities. Studying how endotoxin affects the airways using gene expression changes is an important opportunity to further understand the relationship between endotoxin and lung disease. In this career development proposal, the applicant hypothesizes that endotoxin leads to distinct gene expression changes in the airways. These gene expression changes reflect underlying dysregulated pathways in lung disease that can serve as a biomarker for susceptibility to disease exacerbation, disease development, or clinically important subtypes of lung disease. She proposes to examine the impact of current high endotoxin exposure on airway gene expression in a cohort of inner-city elementary school children with and without asthma. She then proposes to evaluate whether prior endotoxin exposure leads to persistent changes in airway gene expression, even after years of exposure cessation, in a cohort of textile workers. Finally, she proposes to evaluate whether these gene expression changes are markers for important disease-specific subphenotypes, specifically ""exacerbation prone"" asthmatics in the school study and ""emphysema type"" COPD in the textile study. These studies take advantage of the sound study infrastructure present in two already existing and unique cohort studies, and will provide novel insights into the ways nasal gene expression can be used to understand the effects of chronic endotoxin exposure in a field setting. The successful completion of this research will help us understand the genes and biological pathways that are affected by chronic high endotoxin exposure, identify people who are susceptible to endotoxin-related asthma exacerbations, determine whether the type of COPD (emphysema vs. airways disease) can be identified using a simple gene expression based test, and may lead the way to the development of new therapies for endotoxin related lung disease. Additionally, it further characterizes the importance of school endotoxin exposure in asthma morbidity, and may shift the focus from home to school environmental controls for children with asthma. Candidate The applicant's long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical/translational NIH funded investigator focused on patient-oriented research in environmental lung disease. In order to achieve this goal, her short-term career objectives are to obtain further didactic training in environmental epidemiology, advanced biostatistics, genomics, and data mining, as well as practical skills in building a cohort, exposure assessment, obtaining biospecimens, nucleic extraction, selection of appropriate microarray technology, and analytic work in interpreting the output. This will be accomplished with formal classes that complement the candidate's prior coursework in completing a Master of Public Health, fieldwork and collaborative work to learn how to measure environmental endotoxin exposure and to recruit, consent, and maintain a cohort, benchwork using molecular methods, attendance at institutional and national conferences, and guidance from established mentors and a multidisciplinary advisory board with the relevant expertise. This will result in a unique combination of practical skills and scientific knowledge that will help her achieve independence from her mentorship team and prepare her to achieve her long-term career goal. Environment The applicant will perform her research training and career development activities at world-renowned major academic institutions. The division in which she will work is one that has a collaborative environment with both a rich research environment and an intense clinical focus, and has an outstanding history of mentorship, leadership in pulmonary and critical care medicine, and clinical excellence. Her institution is very invested in the applicant's successful career development, and will make available all the facilities, resources, and equipment needed for her career development and proposed research. Her mentors are nationally and internationally renowned experts in pediatric asthma and environmental and molecular epidemiology, and will provide full access to the resources accompanying two unique cohorts of endotoxin exposed children and adults.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic inflammatory lung diseases that affect an estimated 35 million Americans. Endotoxin is a near universal exposure that is derived from gram negative bacteria, and has been associated with both asthma and COPD. The goal of this study is to identify airway gene expression changes due to chronic high endotoxin exposure in inner city schools and textile mills, and to determine whether these gene expression changes can identify important mechanisms of disease and serve as a clinically useful biomarker for important asthma and COPD subtypes.                ","Endotoxin, the airway transcriptome, and obstructive lung disease",8617465,K23ES023700,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomass', 'Biometry', 'Bronchi', 'Burn injury', 'Byssinosis', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Closed Cohort Studies', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Consent', 'Critical Care', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Endotoxins', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Equipment', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gossypium', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Inflammatory', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nasal Epithelium', 'Nose', 'Obstruction', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Occupations', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Silk', 'Smoking', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Textiles', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway epithelium', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'disorder subtype', 'elementary school', 'environmental endotoxin', 'experience', 'inner city', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient oriented research', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'symposium', 'trend']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2013,153360,0.07769078404168726
"A New Approach to Compute PM2.5 for Health Impact Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental air quality impacts human well-being and disease, but the availability of air quality data is limited to selected locations because of the complexity involved in its measurement. Among air pollutants, PM2.5 is of the greatest concern. These particles are not captured by the lungs' natural defenses and can be inhaled deeply, where they can cause health problems ranging from asthma attacks to heart disease.  PM2.5 currently is measured primarily by ground monitoring stations located at approximately 320 EPA sites, providing limited local geographic coverage. However, there are satellites that make a variety of aerosol observations and provide a daily global picture of atmospheric particulates in the form of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Scientists have attempted to compute ground-level PM2.5 (GLP) from these AOD data. However, the multivariate nonlinear relationship between AOD and PM2.5 imposes limitations in computing GLP using satellite data. This project proposes to overcome these limitations by computing reliable GLP via a new methodology which has already been tested and validated.  The study has two specific aims: (1) develop satellite-derived daily GLP estimates for the contiguous U.S., and (2) examine spatial and temporal associations between GLP exposure and hospital visits for asthma exacerbation in Mississippi. Using our methodology, we will generate daily GLP data for a 12-month period at a resolution of 0.10x0.10 (~10x10km2), providing approximately 82,000 data points as opposed to about 300 data points available daily from EPA ground monitoring stations within the contiguous U.S. We will address the nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and AOD which is a function of humidity, temperature, surface pressure, surface wind speed, surface type, boundary layer height, and AOD by accounting for these variables using a machine learning process. The AOD that will be used in this process will be generated by merging AOD data from multiple satellite sensors. Meteorological data will come from NOAA NCEP. Surface type data will be obtained from the satellite-identified vegetation index. Boundary layer height, which is the mixed layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground where people live and work, will come from CALIPSO data which provides vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol extinction.  Information on GLP levels will allow the scientific community to better understand health impacts from exposure to low, moderate, or high levels of PM2.5. Moreover, in places where PM2.5 levels are elevated only occasionally, such as Mississippi, the short-term health impact of increases in PM2.5 can be studied more precisely. National GLP data will be made available to other researchers to facilitate future explorations of how PM2.5 exposure impacts a wide range of health conditions, thereby making possible more timely prophylactic treatment, improving healthcare system preparedness, and better informing public health policymaking.          Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse. The proposed study will provide daily estimates of ground-level PM2.5 for the entire contiguous U.S. so that researchers can study how it affects disease at various locations in the country. The knowledge that results can be used to better inform people about the links between air pollution and disease, and to guide the development of air quality standards to improve public health.

"A Cyber-Informatics Approach to Studying Migration and Environmental Cancer Risk     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World-Wide Web (Web 1.0) and online social media (Web 2.0) have revolutionized the ways medical knowledge is disseminated and health information is exchanged and shared among patients, supporters, and health care providers. Online patient communities have been expanding at an impressive rate with millions of active participants from all age groups. Recent studies on researching and analyzing social media contents for health-related applications show that this uprising cyber-trend leads to valuable knowledge, traditionally acquired with scientific methods such as observational epidemiological studies. This new mode for information acquisition is particularly advantageous for studies requiring long period of data curation. We propose to leverage the power of online contents, including user-generated contents on social network sites, to tackle NCI¿s second provocative question on complex migration patterns and their effect on environmental cancer risk. We hypothesize that the rich amount of personal information shared openly among cancer patients and cancer-free people online can be effectively mined to generate new knowledge on the topic, which cannot be easily uncovered with conventional migrant studies in our modern economy with population mobility patterns far more complex and dynamic than those observed in the past. To achieve our goal, we will build upon our unique cyber-informatics experience at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) on ultra-scale searching, identifying, and understanding free-structured web content. Specifically, we will develop domain-specific informatics tools to automatically reconstruct people's spatiotemporal lifelines, link them to spatiotemporal environmental data available from online sources such as the Environmental Protection Agency, and mine them using machine learning methods to search for salient associations between changes of migration-influenced environmental exposure and cancer risk. These tools will be individually validated and the overall approach will be carefully tested to understand its capabilities, methodological challenges, and practical limitations (if any) for knowledge discovery and scientific explorations in environmental cancer epidemiology. This study has the potential to provide a powerful complementary approach to the standard paradigm of observational epidemiological research. It will offer a fully automated and cost-effective way to discover new trends and monitor evolving ones on the impact of modern population migration patterns and environmental cancer risk. Such information could help cancer epidemiologists and health policy makers generate and prioritize study hypotheses worth testing with carefully controlled and properly powered (but also long term and costly) epidemiological studies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity. In this study we propose to pursue web mining in the environmental cancer risk domain. We will develop dedicated cyber-informatics algorithms and tools to (i) automatically search disparate online sources for retrieving and integrating contents related to individuals¿ cancer history and spatiotemporal environmental exposure profiles, and to (ii) effectively synthesize this information to accelerate knowledge discovery on environmental cancer risk change due to an individual's migration activities.              Web mining has emerged in different domains as a powerful approach to harvesting knowledge of unprecedented quantity, comprehensiveness, and diversity.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,8296583,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2012,1958575,0.08536631959010982
"Objective imaging-based assessment of smoking behavior from used filters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate measurement of smoking behaviors and exposures may become critical as FDA implements its authority to regulate tobacco products, and in particular proposes product standards and considers approval of modified risk products. Recently, digital image analysis systems have been developed that can identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters with high accuracy and can also estimate the degree of smoker compensation. There is strong potential for such digital imaging systems to unobtrusively infer a rich set of smoker topography variables as well as a smoker's exposure to toxins. The existing literature base on filter-based assays is growing and points to growing prominence and applicability of these approaches to important research questions. We propose to modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth- level cigarette smoke exposure by examining tar stains on cigarette filter butts. The Specific Aims are designed to provide rigorous evaluations of the utility of the systems, from establishing prediction equations using machine-smoked cigarettes to cross- validation in human-smoked samples against other established measures of mouth-level exposure. At the conclusion of this project, we plan to release a validated suite of software to the research community to support external verification of digital image analysis for smoking-related research.        Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters. The proposed project will modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth-level cigarette smoke exposure. We plan to make a suite of software publicly available to allow others to apply this technology in their own research.

"Clustering to identify novel phenotypes in childhood asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood asthma is a heterogeneous disease. This is evident given the broad range of clinical characteristics and treatment responses for children defined as asthmatic. Current classification systems for asthma phenotypes are inadequate to fully understand the pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and treatment outcomes of asthma.  Given the heterogeneous nature of asthma, novel ensemble clustering of childhood asthma using data from five clinical trials is proposed. It is hypothesized these discovered phenotypes (or clusters) will have defining characteristics that suggest unique etiologies and appropriate treatment strategies. The aims are to (1) perform ensemble clustering of childhood asthma and describe characteristics for the observed phenotype, (2) develop a model to classify childhood asthma into the phenotypes previously defined in Aim (1), and (3) retrospectively determine whether childhood asthma phenotypes identified by ensemble clustering correlate with treatment responses in clinical trials. We expect (1) fewer than ten phenotypes to be identified with some attributes over- represented in each phenotype, (2) to develop a simple, easily interpretable classification model, and (3) to identify phenotypes for which clinical trial treatments were effective or ineffective.  On the path toward personalized medicine, novel research with ensemble clustering and a large dataset with clinical trial outcomes will advance the field by validating and hypothesizing childhood asthma pathogenesis, pathophysiology and treatment responses.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood asthma is likely not a single disease, but rather a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes (or subtypes). Computational analysis can identify and elucidate the characteristics of these phenotypes. These phenotypes may provide insight into the causes of and appropriate treatments for asthma.              Childhood asthma is likely not a single disease, but rather a heterogeneous disease with many phenotypes (or subtypes).

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide, results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims, we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma, particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness.         By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma. Additionally, we will create a predictive model of asthma, which could potentially lead to the development of a clinical prognostic test of who is at risk for developing asthma.

"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes. This proposal builds on my strong track record of POR, extending the work to add family history from a new case-control collection, validate data by patient interview, and develop predictive models for risk of RA that can be used to select high risk individuals for future RA prevention trials. Project Narrative  Innovative predictive modeling incorporating family history, genes, environmental exposures, and gene-  environment interactions, is a key step in the progress towards an RA prevention clinical trial.","Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk",8288292,K24AR052403,"['ARHGEF5 gene', 'Address', 'Age', 'Air Pollution', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoantibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Calibration', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cigarette', 'Citrulline', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Markers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'First Degree Relative', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'HLA-DR4 Antigen', 'HLA-DRB1', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human Genome', 'ICD-9', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunologist', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Menopausal Status', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Minerals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Notification', 'Occupational', 'PTPN22 gene', 'Paper', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive History', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatoid Factor', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'STAT4 gene', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Surface', 'Sushi Domain', 'Sweden', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'TNF receptor-associated factor 1', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'adalimumab', 'base', 'case control', 'cigarette smoking', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cyclic citrullinated peptide', 'cytokine', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic technology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'infliximab', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'parity', 'patient oriented research', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prevention clinical trial', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'response', 'sample collection', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'trafficking', 'treatment response', 'tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2012,157939,0.04671618872333662
"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting  Abstract Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. We propose to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. We will use this technology to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  We will focus our studies on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from our collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and our preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. We will also test the hypothesis that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood. We will test two potential modifiers: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question for these studies will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, we will examine two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the electron transport chain. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, we begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.

"A New Approach to Compute PM2.5 for Health Impact Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental air quality impacts human well-being and disease, but the availability of air quality data is limited to selected locations because of the complexity involved in its measurement. Among air pollutants, PM2.5 is of the greatest concern. These particles are not captured by the lungs' natural defenses and can be inhaled deeply, where they can cause health problems ranging from asthma attacks to heart disease.  PM2.5 currently is measured primarily by ground monitoring stations located at approximately 320 EPA sites, providing limited local geographic coverage. However, there are satellites that make a variety of aerosol observations and provide a daily global picture of atmospheric particulates in the form of aerosol optical depth (AOD). Scientists have attempted to compute ground-level PM2.5 (GLP) from these AOD data. However, the multivariate nonlinear relationship between AOD and PM2.5 imposes limitations in computing GLP using satellite data. This project proposes to overcome these limitations by computing reliable GLP via a new methodology which has already been tested and validated.  The study has two specific aims: (1) develop satellite-derived daily GLP estimates for the contiguous U.S., and (2) examine spatial and temporal associations between GLP exposure and hospital visits for asthma exacerbation in Mississippi. Using our methodology, we will generate daily GLP data for a 12-month period at a resolution of 0.10x0.10 (~10x10km2), providing approximately 82,000 data points as opposed to about 300 data points available daily from EPA ground monitoring stations within the contiguous U.S. We will address the nonlinear relationship between PM2.5 and AOD which is a function of humidity, temperature, surface pressure, surface wind speed, surface type, boundary layer height, and AOD by accounting for these variables using a machine learning process. The AOD that will be used in this process will be generated by merging AOD data from multiple satellite sensors. Meteorological data will come from NOAA NCEP. Surface type data will be obtained from the satellite-identified vegetation index. Boundary layer height, which is the mixed layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground where people live and work, will come from CALIPSO data which provides vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosol extinction.  Information on GLP levels will allow the scientific community to better understand health impacts from exposure to low, moderate, or high levels of PM2.5. Moreover, in places where PM2.5 levels are elevated only occasionally, such as Mississippi, the short-term health impact of increases in PM2.5 can be studied more precisely. National GLP data will be made available to other researchers to facilitate future explorations of how PM2.5 exposure impacts a wide range of health conditions, thereby making possible more timely prophylactic treatment, improving healthcare system preparedness, and better informing public health policymaking.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse. The proposed study will provide daily estimates of ground-level PM2.5 for the entire contiguous U.S. so that researchers can study how it affects disease at various locations in the country. The knowledge that results can be used to better inform people about the links between air pollution and disease, and to guide the development of air quality standards to improve public health.                Among air pollutants, particulates 2.5 micrometers in diameter and smaller (PM2.5) have the greatest impact on human health because they are small enough to be inhaled deeply into the lungs, making allergies, asthma, and other respiratory conditions worse.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,8139116,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell model', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2011,1957381,0.08536631959010982
"Objective imaging-based assessment of smoking behavior from used filters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate measurement of smoking behaviors and exposures may become critical as FDA implements its authority to regulate tobacco products, and in particular proposes product standards and considers approval of modified risk products. Recently, digital image analysis systems have been developed that can identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters with high accuracy and can also estimate the degree of smoker compensation. There is strong potential for such digital imaging systems to unobtrusively infer a rich set of smoker topography variables as well as a smoker's exposure to toxins. The existing literature base on filter-based assays is growing and points to growing prominence and applicability of these approaches to important research questions. We propose to modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth- level cigarette smoke exposure by examining tar stains on cigarette filter butts. The Specific Aims are designed to provide rigorous evaluations of the utility of the systems, from establishing prediction equations using machine-smoked cigarettes to cross- validation in human-smoked samples against other established measures of mouth-level exposure. At the conclusion of this project, we plan to release a validated suite of software to the research community to support external verification of digital image analysis for smoking-related research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters. The proposed project will modify existing analysis systems and conduct a series of studies to test their reliability, validity, and applicability for determining mouth-level cigarette smoke exposure. We plan to make a suite of software publicly available to allow others to apply this technology in their own research.                 Accurately and simply measuring smoking behavior and smoke exposure is important, and digital image analysis systems have been developed that can estimate smoke intake and identify the blocking of filter vents on spent cigarette filters.

"Using signatures of T-helper cell inflammation to phenotype human asthma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a common disease characterized by airway inflammation, reversible airway obstruction, and airway hyperresponsiveness. There is growing recognition of phenotypic heterogeneity in asthma, including in severity and response to medication. It is likely that these differences are driven by distinct underlying molecular phenotypes, the discovery of which would inform the development of targeted therapies. In prior studies using well-characterized patients with asthma, differences in gene expression from human airway epithelial cells identified two major groups of patients, one in which gene expression is strongly driven by the inflammatory the T-helper cell (Th2) cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13), which has been called Th2 ""high"" asthma, and another in which IL-13 driven genes are not significantly expressed above that level found in healthy controls, or ""Th2 low"" asthma. This work demonstrated that compared to Th2-low asthmatics, Th2-high subjects a better response to inhaled corticosteroids. Based on published data and our own preliminary data, we hypothesize that Th1 and Th17 pathways of inflammation define additional molecular phenotypes of human asthma. Our aims are to test this hypothesis, associate phenotypes to clinical characteristics including response to corticosteroids, and develop diagnostic tools for molecular phenotyping of human subjects based on Th1, Th2 and Th17 signatures. Th1, Th2, and Th17 signatures will be developed from microarray- based whole genome expression-profiling of cytokine-stimulated epithelial cell lines. These signatures will be used to cluster research asthma subjects into T helper subset phenotypes based on the gene expression profiles of their own airway epithelial cells obtained. The most informative epithelial cell genes will be used to develop a PCR-based test. A non-invasive test for these molecular phenotypes will be developed through the use of machine learning algorithms to find patterns in the whole genome expression profiles of subjects' peripheral blood samples. The identification of molecular phenotypes, and the availability of reliable tests to assign Th2, Th1, or Th17 phenotypes non-invasively would provide the potential to predict which medication will work best for an individual while avoiding unnecessary side effects form ineffective therapies, and to inform the development of therapies targeted to specific phenotypes by providing biomarkers during clinical trials.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a very common lung disease affecting 7% of adults in America, and despite high treatment costs, up to 30% of patients do not respond to medications. Asthma has many forms with varying triggers, long-term outcomes and responses to medications. The goals of this work are to 1) apply technological advances in human genomics to discover distinct classes of asthma, and 2) develop tests based on these classes to predict which individuals will respond to a specific therapy, leading to more efficient care and less side effects from ineffective medicines.              Asthma is a very common lung disease affecting 7% of adults in America, and despite high treatment costs, up to 30% of patients do not respond to medications.

"INTEGRATIVE GENOMICS APPROACHES TO MODEL THE GENETIC ARCHITECTURE OF ASTHMA    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease affecting over 20 million Americans and 300 million people worldwide, results from the complex interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many studies have searched for individual genetic variants that contribute to asthma susceptibility, but a thorough understanding of the genetic basis of asthma has not been achieved. Our main hypothesis is that the genetic architecture underlying asthma susceptibility can be better understood by considering multiple genes and incorporating multiple sources of genomic data, including human asthma and mouse airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) data. This hypothesis will be addressed via specific aims in which we will: (1) identify genetic variants that predispose humans to asthma and modulate human AHR by mapping regions associated with AHR in inbred strains of mice to human genome-wide association data, (2) use gene expression data, known protein-protein interactions, and known functional pathways to enhance the search for asthma and AHR genetic variants in humans, and (3) integrate individual human genetic variants to create a multivariate predictive model of asthma. Novel variants identified by Specific Aims 1 and 2 will be validated by replication in independent human populations of asthmatics. The predictive model created in Specific Aim 3 will be validated through replication and prediction in independent human populations of asthmatics. By completing the specific aims, we hope to make progress towards the development of a comprehensive model of the genetics of asthma, particularly of asthma characterized by increased airways responsiveness.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  By completing this proposal, we hope to identify genetic variants that modulate asthma risk. Identifying such variants could provide biological insights that may eventually lead to a better understanding of asthma.

"Biomarker discovery for mitochondrial toxicants using metabolic footprinting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many environmental stressors have deleterious effects on mitochondrial functions, by a variety of mechanisms, and with timelines of different lengths. Mitochondrial dysfunction has multiple clinical presentations, often delayed from the onset of organelle damage. At present, biomarkers that report on mitochondrial function, to enable population studies of environmental exposures and their consequences, are lacking. This proposal seeks to identify candidate biomarkers using a metabolomics approach, in greater depth than has previously been applied to toxicologic investigations.  Metabolomic analysis provides a window on cellular and organismal functions, closer to the actual physiology than genomic or transcriptomic arrays. Using multiple platforms for separation and mass spectrometric resolution of complex mixtures, a comprehensive set of metabolites including organic acids, amino acids, steroids, complex lipids, energy charge and mitochondrial transport metabolites can be targeted. This technology will be employed to develop biomarkers of mitochondrial dysfunction that will fill an important gap in current studies of environmental toxicology.  Studies here will focus on a polybrominated diphenyl ether, BDE-47, that is emerging as one of the major persistent organic pollutants in the U.S. Published data from a collaborator, Dr. Kavanagh, and preliminary data indicate that BDE-47 impairs mitochondrial function in cell lines in vitro. Metabolites in extracellular media (metabolic footprinting) will be analyzed with primary mouse hepatocytes, one of the main targets of BDE-47 toxicity, as a function of dose and time of exposure. The hypothesis to be tested is that fatty acid overload will uncover subtle mitochondrial defects by performing metabolomic analysis in isolated mitochondria. These studies will provide metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity that will next be extended to in vivo studies of plasma and urine from BDE-47 treated mice. The possibility that lymphocytes may be a surrogate tissue for the mitochondrial toxicities of BDE-47 will be examined using the fatty acid overload assay.  The effects of genetic background and environment on BDE-47 toxicity are poorly understood.  Two potential modifiers will be examined: 1) genetically engineered mice with low and high glutathione levels, and 2) fatty liver due to vitamin A deficiency. These experiments will provide novel information on potential high risk populations for BDE-47 exposure. A key question will be whether candidate biomarkers scale with toxicity (in addition to exposure dose).  In addition to discovering metabolic signatures of BDE-47 toxicity, two recently described mitochondrial responses to stress will be tested by metabolic footprinting: 1) mitochondrial proteotoxicity due to aggregation of unfolded/unassembled proteins, and 2) alternative fumarate respiration in response to hypoxia and distal block of the ETC. By selecting defined mitochondrial responses, one adverse and one adaptive, once can begin to categorize mitochondrial dysfunction and look for signatures that associate with specific types. In the case of fumarate respiration, a signature of high levels of succinate in secreted metabolites is already known.  This work is a close collaboration with Oliver Fiehn, expert in metabolomics screening and data analysis, and Terry Kavanagh, an expert in oxidative stress and mitochondrial toxicology.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Public Health Relevance/Project Narrative Many environmental toxins inhibit mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell, as a mechanism of toxicity.

"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases.

"T1D:Investigating the Gut Microbiome, Urinary Proteome and Metabolome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the loss of function of insulin producing pancreatic cells leading to myriad manifestations of the disease in affected individuals. When left untreated this can lead to death. Many studies have shown that development of the disease is the result of interactions between immunological, genetic, and environmental factors. Although, many environmental factors have been implicated, the mechanisms of involvement or major determinants are yet to be clearly identified. Published studies have suggested that T1D results from environmental triggers acting on genetically susceptible individuals and that microbial infection and their immunological consequences are suspected to take part in the pathogenesis. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the causation of beta-cell damage by microbes. Data from retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies strongly suggest the involvement of enteroviruses in the development of T1D. Altered microbial diversity in the gut microbiota has been shown to trigger an abnormal mucosal immune response to further the progression of T1D. Genetic susceptibility traits for T1D are becoming more numerous, including loci for HLA, insulin, protein tyrosine phosphatase-22, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, the interleukin-2 receptor and C- type lectin. This complexity renders them less desirable as predictive tests. Although genetic susceptibility genes are known to play a substantial role in the development of T1D, cellular changes as well as environmental triggers may serve as excellent, potentially more universal biomarkers for risk assessment. For this study, we propose to analyze blood, stool and urine samples from children and adolescent patient populations who have been recently diagnosed with T1D, their siblings, and at-risk cohorts from the TrialNet network (www.diabetestrialnet.org). We propose to apply high-throughput genomics, proteomics and metabolomics techniques to identify molecular signatures discriminating these cohorts. By deconvolution of high-resolution molecular data, we expect to identify viral-microbial specific correlated patterns of proteins and metabolites. Our aim is to discover and verify candidate biomarkers from a large number of biological constituents; from genomic, proteomic and metabolomic datasets through correlation of host microbiome data and genotype. Our purpose is to advance non-invasive clinical tests by applying novel molecular methods to correlate disease status for early diagnosis and prediction of T1D onset, setting the stage for potential therapies or intervention strategies.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years. T1D is an autoimmune disease that occurs when a child's body cannot produce insulin, and genetics as well as environmental factors play a role in the development of this disease. We propose to study the complex interplay of environmental, immunological and genetic factors to discover molecular signatures with a potential to advance clinical diagnosis and therapy at or before the onset of T1D.           The incidence of Type I Diabetes (T1D) has been rising rapidly in children and adolescents over the last 20 years.

"Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite the availability of three major classes of medications for asthma, the response to therapy is highly variable, with as many one-half of all patients being non-responders. Pharmacogenetics provides the promise of ""personalized medicine"", whereby an individual's response to therapy will be guided a priori by his or her genetic make-up. While we have made substantial progress in identifying candidate genes influencing the response to asthma medications, none of these associations accounts for more than a small proportion of the variability in the response. It is clear that to accomplish the goal of ""personalized medicine"" in asthma, we need to identify multiple additional pharmacogenetics loci. Recent advances in technology offer the unprecedented ability to rapidly identify the genetic variants that influence drug treatment response on a genome-wide scale. The major goal of this project is to enhance our prior work in the field of asthma pharmacogenetics via the efficient, but detailed, identification of novel genes associated with the asthmatic response to medications. To accomplish this, we have structured our specific aims as follows: 1. We will analyze GWAS data from 3493 subjects in asthma clinical trials of B2-adrenergic and glucocorticoid treatment response, and perform association testing to determine which genetic variants are associated with an altered therapeutic response. Machine learning approaches will be utilized to model the genetic association data. 2. Robust and replicated pharmacogenetic associations will be explored at the molecular, cellular, and integrative genomic levels to establish functional variants and pharmacogenetic mechanisms. Functional methods will involve bioinformatics tools, mRNA profiling, systems genetics, and cellular and animal models of asthma therapeutic responsiveness. 3. We will develop and validate a set of predictive tests of asthma therapeutic response to short acting B2-adrenergic and inhaled glucocorticoid drugs using clinical and functional knowledge and high-resolution analysis of genetic associations, including epistasis and gene-drug interaction. Additional aims relate to our collaboration with PharmGKB and the PGRN and helping investigators interested in pharmacogenetics. In addition to the GWAS samples, nearly 7000 DNA samples and matching asthma phenotypic data are available for replication testing to validate the initial GWAS results and predictive tests. We believe that these findings will uncover sufficient new information that working models of prognostic tests combining genetic and clinical traits in the prediction of drug response in asthma will result. RELEVANCE: Asthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide and accounts for approximately $20 billion in direct health care costs in the United States annually, with the greatest proportion of those costs allocated to medication and hospitalization costs. The identification of genetic variants that can be used as the basis of a prognostic test to predict which individuals will or will not respond to therapy, thereby minimizing both need for trial and error medication dispensing and risk of hospitalizations due to inadequate therapy, has the potential to substantially decrease both morbidity and financial burden related to asthma.           n/a",Pharmacogenetics of Asthma Treatment,7867594,U01HL065899,"['Accounting', 'Adrenergic Agents', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Asthma', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bioinformatics', 'Breathing', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Resequencing', 'Data', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genomics', 'Glucocorticoids', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Care Costs', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Machine Learning', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Steroids', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Work', 'adrenergic', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic resource', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'interest', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pharmacogenetic testing', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,U01,2010,1992800,0.08536631959010982
"Family History, Genes, Environment and G X E Interaction in Predicting RA Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since receiving the K24 award, I have established a successful clinical research and training program in patient-oriented research (POR) in rheumatic disease with a focus on genetic, biomarker, and environmental risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). I continue to have independent grant support, and have mentored 15 new clinical investigators who have published 25 peer- reviewed papers during the K24 period. Three mentees have received NIH K awards and one has received an NIH R01. With renewal of the K24, I would continue to have protected time to devote to this program that has a unique training environment and an array of important POR projects. Genetic and environmental epidemiology studies have produced convincing evidence for multiple alleles and exposures as RA risk factors. A strong gene-environment (GXE) interaction between HLA-DRB1 alleles and smoking has been demonstrated for risk of the immune phenotype of CCP positive RA but not CCP negative RA. As CCP antibodies occur years before RA onset, I hypothesize that this interaction induces anti-citrulline immunity, a critical step in RA pathogenesis. These findings emphasize the need to study genes, environment and immunity with careful phenotyping. Family history encompasses unmeasured genetic and environmental risk, yet is not measured accurately in other studies including those in my research portfolio. Specific aims are to: 1) Maintain and expand my clinical research training program by mentoring new clinical investigators in POR in rheumatic diseases; 2) Enrich my comprehensive POR program to study family history, genetic, and environmental predictors in the etiology of RA using a new collection of RA cases and controls from Partners HealthCare; 2a) Collect family history data and environmental exposure data concerning smoking and reproductive factors on 1,500 RA patients and 4,500 age- and gender-matched controls by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) queries of electronic medical records; 2b: Examine genetic risk factors, environmental risk factors and GXE in predicting immune phenotypes of RA: RA with and without CCP antibodies (CCP?), and RA with and without rheumatoid factor antibodies (RF?); and 2c: Apply this comprehensive risk model to RA cases and controls and to subsets of RA stratified by specific immune phenotypes and stratified by family history of RA and other autoimmune diseases. The proposed study will leverage the NIH funded Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside study that used an advanced informatics infrastructure to extract clinical data on RA diagnostic features through database mining and NLP. A highly specific algorithm was used to identify RA cases and collect samples from cases and controls. The NLP techniques will be used to extract risk factor data from clinical notes.

"The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomics Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Asthma affects over 17 million people in the United States, and is a significant cause of morbidity.   Development of novel therapies to reduce asthma burden is a major priority of the scientific community, yet such studies are often hampered by the limited availability of clinically relevant biologic samples for investigation. The primary objective of this proposal is to establish the Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research, an open-access collection of immortalized cell lines, cDNA and DNA, and an accompanying complementary dataset for these samples consisting of extensive phenotype data, and genome-wide SNP genotype, gene expression, and methylation data from more than 2,700 well-characterized subjects participating in ongoing genetic and genomic studies of asthma. This Asthma BioRepository will be established through the EVE Consortium, a collaborative effort consisting of U.S. investigators from 11 academic centers who have conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of asthma. The EVE cohorts together total more than 30,000 subjects with genome-wide SNP data and provide broad representation of the North American asthmatic population. The Asthma BioRepository will be developed through the following three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, blood samples and asthma-relevant primary cell types (including CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, alveolar macrophages, and lung biopsy specimens) will be collected for gene expression profiling and DNA methylation studies. Lymphoblastic cell lines will also established. Specific Aim 2 focuses on the development of an accompanying database consisting of genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles for all of the collected samples and   25% of the immortalized cell lines to facilitate comprehensive integrative genomic analysis. This database will be linked to clinical and genome-wide genotype data (in dbGAP), and together with the collected biological specimens and cell lines, the totality of the Asthma BioRepository will be submitted to the NHLBI Biologic Specimen Repository and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC) for distribution to the scientific community. Specific Aim 3 will use the developed database to perform comprehensive integrative genomic analyses to identify the regulatory genetic variation critical to asthma pathogenesis. These studies will include expression profiling of asthma severity; genome-wide expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping; comparison of gene expression profiles and identified eQTLs across asthma-relevant tissues; and genomewide association studies of methylation patterns in asthma. Results of these studies will be submitted to dbGAP and linked to the Asthma BioRepository database to provide investigators with preliminary candidate loci for future investigation. The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research will represent the largest collection of asthma-related biological materials and genomic data in the world, and an invaluable resource for asthma researchers everywhere.      (End of Abstract)           Project Narrative The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research would represent the largest collection of asthma cell lines and accompanying biologic data in the world and would facilitate comprehensive, large-scale molecular analysis in some of the best-characterized asthma populations in existence.

"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           n/a",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7809627,K08DE016956,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Cleft Lip', 'Cleft Palate', 'Cleft lip with or without cleft palate', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mothers', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'computer based statistical methods', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'oral cleft', 'psychologic', 'skills', 'surveillance study']",NIDCR,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K08,2010,129456,0.04707326536962399
"Machine Learning to Identify Complex Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The focus of this application is the development and validation of new computational approaches to identify complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors (features) which could be used to help identify individuals at high risk for a specific disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the conditions in question. Specific Aims of the application include: 1 )To adapt a variety of statistical machine learning methods to the analysis of simulated high density genome scan and environmental exposure data and to evaluate their ability to identify SNPs and environmental factors that are jointly predictive of a binary trait; 2)To apply the described feature selection and model building techniques to the genome-wide SNP genotype data collected from two NHLBI-funded genome-wide association studies: a) the SNPs and Atherosclerosis (SEA) study predicting premature atherosclerosis, and b) the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics of Statins (CAPS) Study predicting LDL cholesterol; 3) to develop a study-specific publicly accessible web-site designed to help disseminate the methods and results of the project and 4) to support the NIH-wide Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI). This proposal represents a unique collaboration focusing on the development of new methods to more effectively identify interacting genetic and environmental factors that account for variation in risk for common cardiovascular and other disease phenotypes. If the risk is determined, in part by a gene-environment interaction, the preventive intervention could include altering the environmental exposure. Furthermore, determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that jointly influence risk may reveal new biologic pathways that would be appropriate targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Together, improved risk stratification and new pathophysiologic insights would be expected to reduce the burden of disease and accelerate the realization of true personalized medicine.

"The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomics Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Asthma affects over 17 million people in the United States, and is a significant cause of morbidity.   Development of novel therapies to reduce asthma burden is a major priority of the scientific community, yet such studies are often hampered by the limited availability of clinically relevant biologic samples for investigation. The primary objective of this proposal is to establish the Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research, an open-access collection of immortalized cell lines, cDNA and DNA, and an accompanying complementary dataset for these samples consisting of extensive phenotype data, and genome-wide SNP genotype, gene expression, and methylation data from more than 2,700 well-characterized subjects participating in ongoing genetic and genomic studies of asthma. This Asthma BioRepository will be established through the EVE Consortium, a collaborative effort consisting of U.S. investigators from 11 academic centers who have conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of asthma. The EVE cohorts together total more than 30,000 subjects with genome-wide SNP data and provide broad representation of the North American asthmatic population. The Asthma BioRepository will be developed through the following three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, blood samples and asthma-relevant primary cell types (including CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, alveolar macrophages, and lung biopsy specimens) will be collected for gene expression profiling and DNA methylation studies. Lymphoblastic cell lines will also established. Specific Aim 2 focuses on the development of an accompanying database consisting of genome-wide gene expression and DNA methylation profiles for all of the collected samples and   25% of the immortalized cell lines to facilitate comprehensive integrative genomic analysis. This database will be linked to clinical and genome-wide genotype data (in dbGAP), and together with the collected biological specimens and cell lines, the totality of the Asthma BioRepository will be submitted to the NHLBI Biologic Specimen Repository and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (BioLINCC) for distribution to the scientific community. Specific Aim 3 will use the developed database to perform comprehensive integrative genomic analyses to identify the regulatory genetic variation critical to asthma pathogenesis. These studies will include expression profiling of asthma severity; genome-wide expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping; comparison of gene expression profiles and identified eQTLs across asthma-relevant tissues; and genomewide association studies of methylation patterns in asthma. Results of these studies will be submitted to dbGAP and linked to the Asthma BioRepository database to provide investigators with preliminary candidate loci for future investigation. The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research will represent the largest collection of asthma-related biological materials and genomic data in the world, and an invaluable resource for asthma researchers everywhere.      (End of Abstract)           Project Narrative The Asthma BioRepository for Integrative Genomic Research would represent the largest collection of asthma cell lines and accompanying biologic data in the world and would facilitate comprehensive, large-scale molecular analysis in some of the best-characterized asthma populations in existence. A centralized biorepository of asthma-related biological samples and viable cell lines from more than 2,700 representative asthmatics would provide the scientific community with an unprecedented source of materials to support ongoing and future investigations and functional studies of the molecular determinants of asthma susceptibility, its natural history, and pharmacogenetics.

"Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed 5-year career development award will provide training and experience in bioinformatics and the administration of large-scale epidemiologic studies and will prepare the applicant for a leadership role in the field of complex diseases. One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward.

"Machine Learning to Identify Complex Interactions in Genome-Wide Association Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The focus of this application is the development and validation of new computational approaches to identify complex interactions among genetic and environmental factors (features) which could be used to help identify individuals at high risk for a specific disease or dysfunction, and provide novel insights into the pathophysiology of the conditions in question. Specific Aims of the application include: 1 )To adapt a variety of statistical machine learning methods to the analysis of simulated high density genome scan and environmental exposure data and to evaluate their ability to identify SNPs and environmental factors that are jointly predictive of a binary trait; 2)To apply the described feature selection and model building techniques to the genome-wide SNP genotype data collected from two NHLBI-funded genome-wide association studies: a) the SNPs and Atherosclerosis (SEA) study predicting premature atherosclerosis, and b) the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics of Statins (CAPS) Study predicting LDL cholesterol; 3) to develop a study-specific publicly accessible web-site designed to help disseminate the methods and results of the project and 4) to support the NIH-wide Genes and Environment Initiative (GEI). This proposal represents a unique collaboration focusing on the development of new methods to more effectively identify interacting genetic and environmental factors that account for variation in risk for common cardiovascular and other disease phenotypes. If the risk is determined, in part by a gene-environment interaction, the preventive intervention could include altering the environmental exposure. Furthermore, determining specific genetic and/or environmental factors that jointly influence risk may reveal new biologic pathways that would be appropriate targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Together, improved risk stratification and new pathophysiologic insights would be expected to reduce the burden of disease and accelerate the realization of true personalized medicine.

"Automating Assessment of Asthma Care Quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  To address the large discrepancy between consensus quality standards and healthcare services actually delivered to those eligible, the Institute of Medicine has called for new quality initiatives and has identified asthma as one if its priority areas. Each year, thousands of preventable deaths are attributed to asthma. The asthma-related health burden is especially pronounced in vulnerable populations. Opportunities to improve asthma care quality hinge on the capacity to comprehensively and routinely assess the care that is actually delivered to asthma patients. Current quality measurement studies require extensive clinical chart review and are not cost-effective on a public health scale. Healthcare information technology (Health IT) could have a big impact by enabling automated quality assessments. Electronic medical record (EMR) systems capture clinical information that could make comprehensive, cost effective quality assessment possible. However, much relevant information (and perhaps 50% or more of the necessary data) resides in free-text clinical notes, which presents a significant challenge to automated quality assessment. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient asthma care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of EMR data from two distinct health systems: a mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (Oregon Community Health Information Network) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the Pacific Northwest. This project leverages Health IT to assess and improve quality of care for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We propose to use an outpatient Asthma Care Quality (ACQ) measure set derived from the original RAND Quality Assessment Tools Project. We will first refine the ACQ measures using up-to-date clinical guidelines and consensus standards for outpatient diagnosis, treatment and management of asthma in patients older than 5 years. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the MediClass system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify ACQ-relevant clinical events in the electronic medical record. Then, we will apply the ACQ measures to assess current levels of asthma care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the association between ACQ measures of recommended asthma care and actual clinical outcomes using extensive longitudinal patient data available at the KPNW study site.          n/a",Automating Assessment of Asthma Care Quality,7498546,R18HS017022,[' '],AHRQ,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2008,395816,0.104271671659602

"Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%. This proposal deals with practical issues that lead the way toward interoperable data. The fruits of this research will assist our national initiatives to pave the way toward a safe and effective BioSecure biosurveillance solution. n/a",Biosurveillance Utilizing SNOMED-CT Based Natural Language Processing,7790142,R01PH000022,[' '],PHPPO,MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2007,677278,0.012869729385908784

One of the strengths of the proposed plan is the commitment of three mentors with diverse and unique areas of expertise. They will oversee a phased development program to provide new and enhanced multidisciplinary skills in study management, the statistical genetics of complex disease, bioinformatics and computational biology, and the ethical issues associated with public health genomics. It will provide the specific and varied skills required to succeed in a career devoted to responsibly-conducted epidemiologic studies that employ state-of-the-art molecular and computational methods to elucidate the mechanisms of complex human diseases. In her research, the applicant will use DNA from mothers and infants enrolled in a large-scale birth defects surveillance study to investigate the multigenic origins of nonsyndromic oral clefts (NOC) using a novel application of a proven analytical approach, Bayesian networks. In accomplishing the first aim, she will identify and validate the most probable network linking the phenotype of isolated NOC to the candidate maternal and subject single nucleotide polymorphisms and environmental exposures among the majority race/ethnicity. Through the second aim, she will validate two approaches to phenotying non-isolated NOC. Finally, she will determine whether the model(s) generated in Aims 1 and 2 can be generalized to minority race/ethnicity groups. This project will provide the framework upon which the investigator will prepare for an independent research career. Additionally, by being the first investigation to concurrently consider the candidate environmental exposures and SNPs in several candidate genes previously associated with NOC in association studies, this work has the potential to move the study of NOC dramatically forward. Relevance: Cleft lip and/or cleft palate are among the most common birth defects have serious physical, psychological, and financial consequences for those affected. Despite this, little is known about the causes of these anomalies because clefts are the result of genetic and environmental risk factors, rather than a single factor. The proposed research has the potential to make a unique contribution to our understanding clefts because it uses novel analytical approaches that allow the simultaneous examination of many potential risk factors.           n/a",Multigenic Dissection of Nonsyndromic Oral Clefts,7102385,K08DE016956,"['artificial intelligence', 'career', 'classification', 'cleft palate', 'clinical research', 'dissection', 'environmental exposure', 'genetics', 'model', 'phenotype']",NIDCR,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,K08,2006,129511,0.04707326536962399
"Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing Bioterrorism remains a significant threat to our public health. Early identification of an increased rate of occurance of patient presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism is one important method to contain bioterror attacks and effect more rapid treatment of exposed individuals. Often presentations consistent with an exposure to an agent of bioterrorism occur in significant numbers prior to the recognition that a bioterrorism related exposure has occurred. This presents an opportunity to capture and analyze signals from patient records. We propose to provide an abstraction of automated clinical information from the clinical record (section by section) that will be coded using SNOMED-CT which can serve as the substrate for surveillance data. We believe that this data (sets of codes by section of the clinical record) which holds the important and salient medical facts (codes) regarding the patients' presentation, findings, medications, allergies and co-morbidities could be abstracted from clinical records. In this study, we will analyze SNOMED-CT's ability to provide adequate content coverage for constellations of symptoms associated with exposures to agents of bioterrorism (i.e. Anthrax, Small Pox, Ricin, and Radiation exposure). Our method builds on the considerable body of research already available within our laboratory. We have been researching methods for codifying medical content using controlled medical vocabularies since 1987. For this study, we will employ the Mayo Vocabulary Server (MVS) developed in the Mayo Laboratory of Biomedical Informatics and has been used at Mayo, Johns Hopkins University and the VA medical centers all with great success. Our performanc2 of the MVS toolkit has been validated for diagnoses where we showed a sensitivity of 99.7% and a specificity of 97.9%. This proposal deals with practical issues that lead the way toward interoperable data. The fruits of this research will assist our national initiatives to pave the way toward a safe and effective BioSecure biosurveillance solution.  n/a",Biosurveillance/SNOMED-CT Natural Language Processing,7098649,R01PH000022,"['abstracting', 'artificial intelligence', 'biohazard detection', 'bioterrorism /chemical warfare', 'communicable disease diagnosis', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'disease outbreaks', 'early diagnosis', 'environmental health', 'human data', 'mathematical model', 'medical records', 'model design /development', 'public health', 'rapid diagnosis', 'vocabulary development for information system']",PHPPO,MAYO CLINIC,R01,2005,514616,0.013017311671019926
"Computational Toxicity Assessment Using Omic Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The application of modern high throughput genomic and metabonomic technologies to the field of toxicology will provide significant breakthroughs and advances. By simultaneously looking at data on gene expression and metabolite concentrations, a more accurate and complete picture of cellular behavior can be determined. Using statistical and mathematical algorithms applied to high throughput data, toxicant exposure characterization will be computed including identification of type of exposure and estimates of dose amount. In the current proposal, we intend to apply the latest multivariate linear and non-linear statistical and mathematical techniques to find subtle and complex patterns in the data that are consistent with validated samples of known toxic exposure. By using supervised machine learning techniques, training data with cross-validated measurements will be used to quantitatively measure the accuracy of the proposed statistical techniques. By applying these techniques to a wide variety of both public and in house data samples consisting of gene expression data and metabolomic NMR concentration data, small correlations and patterns can be measured and used to characterize the type and amount of environmental and toxicant exposure to host organisms. The basic research carried out in this proposal can result in a useful analysis tool that has a broad applications in drug discovery as well as diagnostic applications in monitoring of host organism exposure to harmful substances.         n/a",Computational Toxicity Assessment Using Omic Data,6882458,R43ES013595,"['data management', 'environmental exposure', 'gene expression', 'high throughput technology', 'mathematics', 'metabolomics', 'statistics /biometry', 'technology /technique development', 'toxicology']",NIEHS,"GENOMATICA, INC.",R43,2005,125602,0.026451272266836766

"AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR TELEPHONIC MGMT OF ASTHMA Asthma is a highly prevalent disease with a significant morbidity                leading to emergency room visits, hospitalizations and absenteeism from          work and school. Two major factors contributing to asthma morbidity (and         mortality) are failure to detect asthma decompensation and use of                inappropriate treatment strategies. Asthma severity can be assessed by           clinical symptoms and peak flow measurements. There are internationally          accepted guidelines for asthma management. However, rapid translation            of asthma symptoms into a change in therapy is frequently impeded by the         patient's inability to understand self management, reluctance to contact         the health care provider, or delays in feedback from the provider to the         patient. The objective of the proposal is to develop and clinically              evaluate a new Automated System for Telephonic Home Management of                Asthma.                                                                                                                                                           We describe the design and alpha testing of a dynamic relational                 database (DRdb) suitable for use either in a isolated PC or in a                 distributed computer system to support daily reporting and facilitate            all provider monitoring. The resulting DRdb accepts information about            the patient, their specific diagnoses and treatment regimens. Each DRdb          is accessible on-line, linked through LAN or WAN and captures the                patient's symptoms and measurements at the moment when they are                  reported. Because the patient's history is electronically available, the         DRdb can dynamically support the health professional to relay                    instructions immediately. Generally these instructions are pre-defined           by the patient's doctor for the reported symptom set. Automation of              these procedures may be possible.                                                                                                                                 Specifically, we are developing a custom telephone interface, conducting         a clinical trial in both adult and pediatric populations in which asthma         management is under constant physician direction and where asthma                intervention is (I) computer-assisted, (II) computer-mediated, or (III)          according to conventional methods (Control Group). We measure end-points         relevant to disease managers(costs), to health care providers(time) and          to asthmatic patients(respiratory outcomes). The goals of the Asthma             system described in this proposal are to save time (efficacy), and               increase patient and health care provider satisfaction (attractiveness).

"A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal aims to characterize the associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and children’s cognitive health through the efficient use of big public health data. With guidance from multidisciplinary advisors, the candidate will develop skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics to supplement her training in epidemiologic methods. This will allow her to progress in her career and advance research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. Previous research has found associations between prenatal exposure to single air pollutants and children’s cognitive health but has lacked the ability to investigate combined impacts of multiple pollutants, including the synergistic/antagonistic interactions between pollutants that have been observed in experimental studies. Understanding the effects of combined exposures is a strategic goal of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and the field of environmental health is transitioning from single-pollutant approaches to more holistic paradigms, such as the exposome. Identifying associations and interactions within the context of high-dimensional exposure data presents a computational challenge. Methods from domains such as data science, including machine learning methods, can be incorporated into the epidemiologic toolbox for addressing environmental mixtures and multiple exposures. The goal of this Career Development Award is to advance the candidate into an independent research career at the intersection of big data science and children’s environmental health. Through formal coursework, directed learning and field rotations, the candidate will gain skills in data science, machine learning and advanced biostatistics. Mentors, advisors and consultants have been selected for their complementary expertise, relevant research experience and mentoring abilities. The proposed research will leverage the skills gained from the training plan and apply them to characterize associations between prenatal exposure to interpretable combinations of air toxics and 3rd grade standardized test scores, a school-based measure of cognitive outcomes. Residence at birth will be used to link data on air toxics, a subset of air pollutants, to an administrative data linkage of public health registries and education data for approximately 220,000 children born in New York City from 1994-1998. The candidate will develop and validate a two-stage approach of hypotheses generation followed by targeted analyses in order to identify combinations of air toxics associated with children’s test scores within the context of high-dimensional exposure data (Aim 1). Targeted analyses using well-established epidemiologic methods for effect estimation and assessment of interaction between air toxics will be performed. (Aim2) Potential mediators of the relationship between air toxics and test scores can then be identified using statistical mediation and data science approaches. (Aim 3) Completion of these aims will uniquely position the candidate to conduct future research on combined environmental exposures and children’s health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Epidemiologic studies have shown that prenatal and/or early-life exposures to ambient air pollutants are associated with multiple measures of neurodevelopment and cognition in childhood. However, most of the previous studies characterized exposure using a single pollutant, even though ambient air is a complex mixture. This study will identify the combined effects of prenatal exposure to multiple air pollutants on children's standardized test scores within a large, representative population of urban children.",A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH TO AIR TOXICS AND CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,9999949,R00ES027022,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Monitoring', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Distal', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York City', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Selection Bias', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Urban Population', 'adverse birth outcomes', 'base', 'big-data science', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genome wide association study', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neurodevelopment', 'pollutant', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'random forest', 'research and development', 'residence', 'skills', 'third grade', 'urban children']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2020,247463,0.014068541642154512
"Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network ABSTRACT The goal of this U24 application is to establish the Data, Modeling, and Coordination Center (DMCC) for the NHLBI's Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma (PrecISE) Network. The objective of PrecISE is to conduct sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials with precision interventions in stratified patient with severe asthma populations. Patients with severe asthma are heterogeneous, and thus a hard to treat population. Precision medicine interventions, which focus on identifying the best treatments for individual patients instead of the best treatments for the most patients, could improve overall outcomes among this complex patient population. The PrecISE Network is poised to address these issues. Central to its success will be an innovative, forward-looking, and productive Coordinating Center that brings cohesion to the participating Clinical Center investigators by sharing their visions and providing scientific leadership, organizational support and analytic results for PrecISE trials. Key elements that will enhance collaboration and research progress include experienced leadership, innovative design and analysis methodologies (e.g., sequential adaptive designs, machine learning, neural networks, Q-learning), comprehensive research operations support, a state-of-the-art data management system, and superior administrative support. Our infrastructure will provide both public and private websites which include PrecISE information pages for the public, participants, and investigators, frequently asked questions, study materials, project calendar, a communications hub, and other key features. We will develop a secure, user-friendly advanced data management system that includes web-based access for surveys, data entry, research management (including comprehensive reporting, biosample tracking and performance-based reimbursement tools), integration with external applications, and quality control. Our research operations and administration teams will provide a solid foundation to PrecISE by facilitating communication including meeting arrangements and minutes, collaborative document preparation, tracking of regulatory compliance, and support for abstract and publication preparation across the PrecISE Network. Together, this integrated structure will set the stage for the execution of high-impact, sequential, adaptive, phase II/proof of concept trials in the PrecISE Network, which can lead to the establishment of potential personalized treatment approaches for patients with severe and/or exacerbation-prone asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe asthma affects 10% of people worldwide, and despite currently available treatments, asthma remains poorly controlled for many patients. The National Institutes of Health is funding a new iteration of previous high- impact asthma clinical trials networks, which will take a personalized medicine approach to identify new therapies for severe asthma, tailored to an individual patient using data-based treatment algorithms that leverage information on his/her individual disease and treatment history. Our proposal is to provide leadership and statistical research support to this network.","Data, Modeling,and Coordination Center for PrecISE Network",9986880,U24HL138998,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biometry', 'Calendar', 'Case Report Form', 'Certification', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Files', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Reporting', 'Database Management Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genomic medicine', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Mediation', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multicenter Trials', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Online Systems', 'Operations Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Privatization', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Writing', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'data de-identification', 'data harmonization', 'data management', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'material transfer agreement', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'patient stratification', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public repository', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'response', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U24,2020,13299576,0.09608036203591792
"OBJECTIVE HOME MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC ASTHMA EXACERBATION USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is the most common chronic pediatric disease in the United States, affecting 6.2 million or 1 in 12 children. Despite advances in the management of childhood asthma, asthma exacerbation results in approximately 550,000 emergency department (ED) visits, 80,000 hospitalizations, and hundreds of premature deaths each year. Early symptoms of asthma exacerbation, especially in children, are nonspecific and are unfortunately often not recognized by parents as asthma until the child demonstrates more severe symptoms, enough to require emergent care. The long-term goal of this STTR initiative is to empower parents to initiate timely therapy for acute asthma by supplementing their subjective assessment with an objective measure of acute asthma severity. The mobile technology we propose to develop, test and deploy toward this goal will use digital signal processing (DSP) and machine learning (ML) to determine three distinct severity zones (corresponding to the green, yellow and red zones on the asthma action plan) allowing parents to follow asthma action plans accurately. The resulting improved and timely home-based management of childhood asthma should reduce current excessive ED utilization and unacceptably high rates of morbidity and mortality. The proposed technology is inspired by and based on the pediatric asthma severity score (PASS). PASS is used in many pediatric EDs for objective assessment of acute asthma severity to aid management of acute asthma and critical discharge and hospitalization decisions. The components of PASS are five well-studied and validated clinical parameters. Our goal in the proposed project is to develop new technology that enables parents to make similar measurements in the home setting and map those to the 3 color-coded zones for easier execution of asthma action plans. The 2 specific aims of the project are to 1) build a pediatric asthma database with ground-truth clinical findings, and 2) develop and validate DSP and ML algorithms for automated assessment of acute asthma severity. The successful completion of these aims will result in a validated technology suitable for objective, home-based assessment of acute asthma severity. Such assessment is currently possible but only in medical facilities by trained medical staff. Our Phase II goals will be to (a) further improve and deploy the technology in homes and (b) conduct a prospective trial measuring its feasibility, utilization and effectiveness in controlling asthma emergencies and costs. In Phase II, we will also pursue the necessary regulatory approvals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is the most common chronic disease in children associated with high rates of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and premature deaths. These problems exist because families find it difficult to recognize the symptoms of asthma. The goal of this project is to develop novel technology suitable for home use that will make recognizing the symptoms of asthma easier, leading to timely administration of medication and avoidance of serious complications.",OBJECTIVE HOME MANAGEMENT OF PEDIATRIC ASTHMA EXACERBATION USING MOBILE TECHNOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING,10010457,R41NR019735,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Auscultation', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emergent care', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oxygen', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Research', 'Respiratory Sounds', 'Severities', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speech', 'Stethoscopes', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Wheezing', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work of Breathing', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic patient', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'digital', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication administration', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'premature', 'prospective', 'respiratory']",NINR,"AUSCULTECH DX, LLC",R41,2020,257878,0.12074777707585192

"Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology OVERALL : ABSTRACT This is the third competing continuation for an accomplished Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). The Director is Trevor M. Penning, PhD (The Thelma Brown and Henry Charles Molinoff Professor of Pharmacology) and the Deputy Director is Rebecca A. Simmons, MD (The Hallam Hurt Endowed Professor in Pediatrics). The Center is comprised of 71 members from 18 Departments and 5 Schools, with almost equal representation of basic and clinician-scientists drawn from the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). The CEET has built an institutional, regional and national identity in environmental health sciences (EHS) in the absence of a School of Public Health and Department of EHS at Penn. The synergistic combination of basic and clinician-scientists within the CEET promotes translational environmental health research that addresses fundamental questions and translates knowledge into action to have a major impact on human health and disease consistent with the NIEHS Strategic Plan. The CEET mission is to “elucidate the mechanistic links between environmental exposures and human disease, and translate findings into action to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, and local, national, and global communities”. This mission is accomplished through five aims. In Aim 1: We use a flexible thematic area structure to conduct translational environmental health research to improve precision public health. Our current themes are in Air Pollution & Lung Health; Environmental Exposures & Cancer; Windows-of- Susceptibility; and Environmental Neuroscience. Each thematic area integrates the pillars or exposure science, adverse outcome constructs (pathways and networks) to explain the phenome with translation to communities and human subjects. In Aim 2: We conduct bi-directional communication with communities in S.E and N.E. Pennsylvania and use community engagement to set the research agenda for the CEET. In Aim 3: We provide a facility core structure to promote precision public health. Our Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core is adept in human subject study design and in conducting population exposure services, using cartographic modeling, GIS tools and biosensors. Biomarkers of exposure and effect are measured in our Translational Biomarker Core which conducts mass spectrometric assays at a level of precision and accuracy difficult to emulate elsewhere. The Exposure Biology Informatics Core brings to bear the power of computation, machine learning and AI to predict the toxicity of unknowns and integrate Big-data sets to recognize patterns in “omics” data and predict adverse outcomes. In Aim 4: We build capacity in environmental health sciences by funding pilot projects to Early Stage Investigators (ESI) and to senior investigators conducting environmental health research for the first time. In Aim 5: We cultivate the careers of ESI through a transformative Environmental Health Scientist Support Program that provides mentoring, grant proposal review, environmental health and Facility Core workshops. OVERALL : NARRATIVE The Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET) conducts research that links environmental exposures, to adverse outcomes and translates its findings to human subjects and communities to identify the most vulnerable and improve prevention, intervention and treatment through precision public health. Bi- directional communication through the Community Engagement Core helps set the research agenda of the CEET and inform public health decision making.",Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology,9917966,P30ES013508,"['Address', 'Air Pollution', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asbestos', 'Award', 'Beer', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biosensor', 'Cities', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Community Healthcare', 'Complement', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmacology', 'Philadelphia', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Superfund', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'career', 'career development', 'cheminformatics', 'environment related cancer', 'environmental toxicology', 'exposed human population', 'flexibility', 'health science research', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'improved', 'lead exposure', 'medical schools', 'member', 'next generation', 'phenome', 'professor', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'wasting']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P30,2020,1616900,0.07816969040223787
"Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation PROJECT SUMMARY Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children. In our preliminary study, we discovered significant variations in the volume and quality of clinical documentation on asthma in electronic medical records (EMRs) between pediatric residents and pediatric faculty. For example, although pediatric residents documented much more extensively than the pediatric faculty on asthma-related histories consistent with a diagnosis of asthma, the residents were less likely to make an actual diagnosis of asthma than their faculty counterparts. This variation in documenting asthma-related events in EMRs has two important implications: one is a proficiency issue related to the training of pediatric residents in achieving clinical competence in asthma care and documentation; the other is a data quality issue, which impacts the secondary use of EMR for downstream analyses. At present, little has been reported on the secondary use of EMR for residency training. The primary goal of this proposed study is to develop an informatics tool assessing residents' adherence to asthma guidelines (i.e., competence in asthma care) and documentation variation (i.e., competence in documentation) (Aim 1) and evaluate individual pediatric resident's competence in asthma care and documentation by conducting a population-based birth cohort study (Aim 2). The tool can be utilized to provide “individualized clinical effectiveness data” for residents enhancing their clinical competence in asthma care, as recommended by the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). In Aim 1: We will develop an automated informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma guidelines and documentation variation in primary care settings. We will extract the necessary clinical elements from both structured data querying from our database and unstructured data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assess adherence to guidelines and documentation variation. The performance of element extraction will be assessed against manual chart reviews as gold standard. In Aim 2: We will evaluate clinical competence of pediatric residents in asthma care and asthma diagnosis. We will assess clinical competence in asthma care for children with persistent asthma and examine clinical competence in asthma diagnosis from clinical documentation using the informatics tool developed in Aim 1. Expected outcomes: The proposed research is significant, innovative, and exploratory as little is known about the secondary use of EMR for residency training. If successful, the study results will: a) deliver individualized clinical effectiveness data report to pediatric residents to enhance their clinical training and documentation; and b) provide an informatics tool assessing adherence to asthma care guidelines in clinical practice settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma is the most common chronic illness among children that is frequently evaluated and managed by pediatric residents. No training tools are available that provide individualized feedback on residents' competence in asthma care and documentation from their clinical notes. We address this challenge by developing an automated tool to provide data-driven feedback to individual residents to enhance their competence in asthma care and documentation.",Secondary use of EMR for residency training in asthma care and documentation,9828754,R21AI142702,"['Accreditation', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Competence', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Documentation', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'data quality', 'graduate medical education', 'individualized feedback', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'structured data', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIAID,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R21,2020,198750,0.12197429296468454
"Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data Project Summary/Abstract Cholera is an acute dehydrating diarrheal disease caused by infection with Vibrio cholerae. It is endemic in over 50 countries, affecting up to 3 million people and causing more than 100,000 deaths annually. A renewed global effort to fight cholera is underway, catalyzed by the large on-going epidemic in Haiti and now aided by new generation oral cholera vaccines. Identifying key populations at high risk of cholera is essential to guide these activities. Current methods to estimate cholera burden are largely based on clinical reporting with infrequent microbiological confirmation. These methods are limited by the sporadic nature of outbreaks, poor surveillance infrastructure, and fundamental uncertainties in the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Improved methods of detecting cholera exposure and risk are urgently needed. Detection of immune responses in serum (serosurveillance) can provide a new avenue for rapid and accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk. We currently do not understand what immunological and clinical parameters are most predictive of recent exposure, nor whether immune responses in areas with different levels of endemicity are similar. In preliminary studies, we have used machine learning methods on antibody response data from cholera patients in Bangladesh to classify whether individuals had been exposed in the previous 30-, 90-, or 360-days with high sensitivity and specificity. In this application, we propose to use longitudinal antibody response kinetics, from populations with diverse genetic and epidemiologic profiles, paired with novel statistical and machine learning approaches to provide generalizable tools to estimate the incidence of exposure to Vibrio cholerae from cross sectional serosurveys. In Aim 1, we will develop models to estimate the time since exposure to Vibrio cholerae and exposure incidence from cross-sectional antibody profiles and demographic data using previously collected data from a cohort in Bangladesh. These results will allow us to identify the antibodies and demographic factors that are most useful for prediction of time-since-exposure. In Aim 2, we will collect longitudinal antibody data from a cohort of cholera cases and household contacts in Haiti to develop models for estimating exposure incidence from cross-sectional serosurveillance. This cohort will also enable us to compare the models developed for moderate/severe cases and mild/asymptomatic cases. In Aim 3, we will optimize and validate field-adapted methods to measure cholera-specific antibodies, including the use of dried blood spot and lateral flow assays. We will conduct a proof-of-concept cross-sectional serosurvey using these methods in rural Haiti. Upon the completion of these aims, we will have provided a number of new tools for measure of susceptibility to cholera in a population. These tools will have the potential to transform cholera control efforts from the current reactive strategies to proactive ones, with the potential to contribute to disease elimination. Project Narrative Cholera is a diarrheal disease affecting millions of people worldwide each year, with the majority of deaths due to cholera occurring in places with poor disease surveillance infrastructure. To optimize cholera control efforts, accurate estimates of cholera exposure and risk are needed. We propose studies using computational methods to determine how antibody decay data may help us estimate cholera exposure incidence.",Estimating Cholera Burden with Cross-sectional Immunologic Data,9912094,R01AI135115,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Area', 'Bangladesh', 'Bangladeshi', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Cholera', 'Cholera Vaccine', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Haiti', 'Haitian', 'Health care facility', 'Health system', 'Household', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural', 'Sanitation', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Standardization', 'Surveillance Methods', 'System', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Vibrio cholerae O1', 'Vibrio cholerae infection', 'Water', 'age related', 'base', 'cohort', 'diarrheal disease', 'disorder risk', 'fighting', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2020,667663,0.023622061867725877
"The Impact of Temperature and Pollution on Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Cost Among the Elderly OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Determinants of Vulnerability to Environmental Stress Among the Elderly ADRD Population As individuals live longer, healthier lives, the number of people living with, and dying from, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has risen. AD prevalence and mortality are expected to continue to rise in the future. However, while AD is fatal and individuals living with AD have high mortality rates, their immediate cause of death is usually respiratory disease or ischemic heart disease rather than dementia. Consequently, improving the health and quality of life of people living with ADRD depends on understanding their vulnerability to these diseases, and how these conditions interact with their dementia. Our proposed study focuses on the determinants of health and mortality among those in the Medicare population who have been identified as living with ADRD. Because cardiovascular and respiratory diseases have been identified as frequent causes of death among the ADRD population, we focus on an environmental stressor that increases the likelihood of death due to cardiovascular and respiratory causes: acute exposure to air pollution. Using a large dataset of Medicare beneficiaries and machine-learning techniques applied to quasi-random variation in pollution exposure generated by changes in local wind direction, we find that acute exposure to air pollution increases mortality risk for only about one quarter of the elderly. While individuals living with ADRD are much more likely to be in this vulnerable group than the typical Medicare beneficiary, we find that acute air pollution exposure does not increase mortality risk for a large fraction (44%) of Medicare beneficiaries living with ADRD. In this study, we will apply machine learning and “big data” techniques to Medicare administrative data, local characteristics, and atmospheric variables in order to understand why some individuals living with ADRD suffer harm from the increased cardiovascular and respiratory stress induced by air pollution exposure while others do not. These factors, once identified and verified in continuing research, will provide guidance that can improve the health and quality of life of individuals living with ADRD by better directing resources to those most in need and guiding interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability to these and other hazards. As part of the project, we will develop a publicly available database that provides the following data at the ZIP code level: ADRD prevalence, vulnerability to air pollution exposure among the ADRD population, and ZIP code level characteristics that have been shown to affect vulnerability. Other researchers can then use this data for any other study seeking to understand the effects of geographically defined factors or policies on the ADRD population. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative While Alzheimer’s disease is a fatal form of dementia, the top two immediate causes of death for people with Alzheimer’s disease are respiratory illness (55.5%) and ischemic heart disease (23.1%), which are both exacerbated by exposure to environmental hazards such as air pollution. In this study, we will apply machine learning and “big data” techniques to Medicare administrative data in order to identify risk factors that predict vulnerability to the harmful effects of pollution exposure for individuals living with ADRD, allowing for better targeting of resources to those most in need and contributing to the improvement of interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability to these and other hazards.","The Impact of Temperature and Pollution on Mortality, Morbidity, and Health Care Cost Among the Elderly",10123225,R01AG053350,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Big Data', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Environmental Hazards', 'Environmental Wind', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicare', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Policies', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'beneficiary', 'environmental stressor', 'hazard', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'respiratory']",NIA,NATIONAL BUREAU OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH,R01,2020,376508,-0.03899459083346332
"Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health, particularly with the rise of knowledge-based economies. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. Multiple barriers are inherent to conducting mixtures research and must be overcome if this field is to progress. Obvious barriers include the need for large sample sizes and prospective data to assess exposure timing (i.e. critical developmental windows). Two additional barriers include exposure misclassification and lack of statistical approaches available for higher dimensional interactions. Our proposal addresses all of these barriers directly and will establish a framework for the study of chemical mixtures that can be applied broadly in environmental health. We have developed a novel biomarker that can objectively reconstruct the dose and timing of past chemical exposure using deciduous teeth. This biomarker differs from standard tooth biomarkers as it combines sophisticated histological and chemical analyses to precisely sample dentine layers corresponding to specific life stages, generating integrated, longitudinal weekly exposure estimates in the second and third trimesters and during early childhood. Our proposal will address mixed metal exposure, as a first step. We note, however, that our approach can and will be applied to organic chemicals in the future, and we are in parallel developing methods for their analysis in teeth. On another front, we will also apply cutting-edge statistical machine learning methods. In this study, we will focus on five metals/metalloids that are of public health significance, manganese (Mn), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd). We will conduct this study in the Early Life Exposures in MExico and NeuroToxicology (ELEMENT), a prospective birth cohort using advanced methods in social science, genetics and toxicology to assess transdisciplinary risk factors impacting neurodevelopment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neurodevelopment and cognitive function are among the most important outcomes in public health. While it is widely believed that the simultaneous presence of several toxic exposures can alter developmental trajectories of the central nervous system, studies designed to address mixed chemical exposures are rare, and represent a critical need in the field of public health. The proposed program will apply a novel dental biomarker of exposure to multiple chemicals and cutting-edge statistical methods to identify specific life stages including perinatal periods that correspond to increased susceptibility to neurodevelopmental effects of metal toxicant mixtures.",Novel Biomarker to Identify Critical Windows of Susceptibility to Metal Mixture,10005934,R01ES026033,"['8 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Cadmium', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dental', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manganese', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Nutrient', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tooth structure', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deciduous tooth', 'developmental neurotoxicity', 'early childhood', 'early life exposure', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'neurodevelopment', 'neurodevelopmental effect', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'perinatal period', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'synergism', 'tool', 'toxicant']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,604973,0.05185347057887191
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development Project Summary/Abstract Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) include multiple classes of chemicals that have been used extensively in consumer products. Mounting evidence from toxicological and epidemiological studies suggest EDCs are developmental neurotoxicants, and EDC exposure during the critical in utero period is associated with adverse child cognitive development. Unfortunately, current research focuses on individual EDCs and largely ignores joint and interactive effects of EDCs and the overall effect of the EDC mixture. To assess exposure to multiple EDCs simultaneously, one must consider the high dimensionality of the exposure matrix and the complex correlation structures across chemicals in statistical analyses. To address limitations of existing methods, we propose to adapt a robust technique that is well-established for pattern recognition and dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We specifically aim to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a type of robust Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization, to determine the patterns of exposure to four ubiquitous classes of EDCs known to cross the placenta—polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phenols (e.g., bisphenol A), and phthalates—and to characterize the relationship between these exposure patterns and cognitive development. LDA is empirically-driven so that the researcher does not need to specify a priori the number of patterns, and the non-negativity constraint enhances the interpretability of the patterns identified. For our health model, we will use a supervised approach that allows child cognitive scores to inform the LDA solution, thereby enabling identification of patterns most relevant to the outcome. We will conduct this work using the existing infrastructure of the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health Mothers and Newborns Study, a longitudinal birth cohort of mother-child dyads. We will also establish reproducibility of the method by creating a user-friendly R package so that other researchers can easily apply LDA in environmental epidemiology, and we will verify transferability and functionality of the method on a separate cohort. This will be the first study to assess the interacting and overall effects of multiple EDCs on child cognitive development, introducing LDA as a straight-forward tool for the analysis of complex mixtures in epidemiology. If successful, this method has broader implications for environmental epidemiology, as it can easily be applied to other environmental mixtures of interest. The activities encompassed by this proposal (study design, data management, advanced statistics, machine learning, data science, and presentation of findings) cover the set of fundamental research skills required by a scientist entering the interdisciplinary field of environmental epidemiology in the era of Big Data and Precision Public Health. The applied experience gained from carrying out this research, in combination with didactic training and individual cross-disciplinary mentoring, comprises a comprehensive research training plan that will serve as a platform from which to launch a career as an independent investigator in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative This study will be the first to determine existing patterns of cross-class endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposure in utero and to evaluate their association with child cognitive development, assessing potentially non- linear independent effects, non-additive interactions, and the overall effect of the mixture. This will help to identify environmental risk factors most amenable to public health interventions and inform future researchers and policy makers about concurrent exposure to EDCs in a vulnerable population The adaptation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for pattern identification and dimension reduction in environmental epidemiology integrates data science and machine learning into environmental health research, which is novel and extremely relevant to public health, as LDA can be easily applied to other environmental mixtures and co-exposures of interest.",Complex Mixtures of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in Relation to Cognitive Development,9893708,F31ES030263,"['Address', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Cosmetics', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Flame Retardants', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Household', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'Joints', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotoxins', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Paint', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phenols', 'Placenta', 'Plastics', 'Policy Maker', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'Urine', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'career', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'consumer product', 'data management', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fundamental research', 'health of the mother', 'high dimensionality', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple datasets', 'neurotoxicity', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'pollutant', 'polybrominated diphenyl ether', 'prenatal exposure', 'public health intervention', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2020,32095,0.08469731797600336
"Perinatal Origins of Asthma Project Abstract  Early in life many children develop wheezing which can be a sign of early-onset asthma. Yet, not all children who experience wheezing episodes develop asthma. Predicting asthma that begins early in life is important as those who develop early-onset asthma are more likely to have persistent symptoms and structural changes to the lung. Identification and early intervention of high risk individuals could prevent long term lung function abnormalities and provide an alternative to costly treatment. To date, risk prediction models for early- onset asthma are limited mainly to clinical history and presentation. Additionally, no one model contains both reliable sensitivity and specificity or clinically valid serological predictors for early-onset asthma.  Our laboratory has focused previously on immunologic responses to common asthmatic triggers, house dust mite (HMD) and cockroach allergens, between individuals and how these responses differ between populations and outcomes. We have identified increased lymphoproliferation and cytokine response (IL-13) in allergen-stimulated cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) derived from individuals who are atopic or African- Americans. Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan, stimulate the cytokine production of IL-13 and IFN-γ. In this proposal our preliminary data indicate that the production of IL-13 after allergen exposure in CBMCs is associated with exposure to different microbiota. In addition, early exposure to Moraxellaceae greatly enhances IL-13 production by CBMCs after exposure to HDM. Taken together, our data suggest that early-life bacterial exposure may enhance the production of cytokines that can alter host physiology and immunity.  In this translational medicine proposal, we will build a predictive model for early-onset asthma that will be applicable to general and high risk populations. Our approach will include high-throughput techniques to assess bacterial exposure and immunologic response in the perinatal time period. We will integrate the large amount of data generated into a pipeline with machine learning algorithms that will be regulated specifically for the prediction of later onset of disease. In addition, we will assess bacterial exposure in association with mothers who carry risks for asthma development in their children. The proposed studies will address both the need of predictive model for early-onset asthma and identify bacterial-host interactions associated with high risk populations (e.g. maternal risk factors). Together, these studies form the platform for multidisciplinary training in microbe- immune interactions, predictive risk for asthma, bioinformatics and form a solid foundation to launch a successful career as a physician- scientist. Project Narrative Asthma is the most common chronic disorder of childhood. Early-onset asthma, if left untreated, leads to long term respiratory dysfunction, and currently, no clinical tools reliably aid in prediction of asthma. Therefore, this proposal aims to develop a predictive model for asthma involving microbial and immune interactions that will be applicable to the general and high risk populations.",Perinatal Origins of Asthma,10000960,F30HL136001,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Allergens', 'Allergic', 'Allergic rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Atopic Dermatitis', 'Bacterial DNA', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dictyoptera', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food Hypersensitivity', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemophilus', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Life', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mononuclear', 'Moraxella', 'Moraxellaceae', 'Mothers', 'Obesity', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Peptidoglycan', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Pyroglyphidae', 'Recording of previous events', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serological', 'Solid', 'Streptococcus', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'United States', 'Wheezing', 'airway remodeling', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'cockroach allergen', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individual response', 'machine learning algorithm', 'maternal risk', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiota', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonate', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'persistent symptom', 'predictive modeling', 'prepregnancy obesity', 'prevent', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory', 'respiratory colonization', 'respiratory health', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'smoking during pregnancy', 'tool', 'translational medicine']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,F30,2020,50520,0.14709612625147975
"Environment, Metabolomics, and PD Project Abstract Our PEG study is among the largest Parkinson's disease (PD) population-based study with exceptional high-quality disease characterization and in-depth exposure assessment. Patients are diagnosed and examined (multiple times) by a UCLA movement disorder specialist. We developed a longitudinal geographic information system (GIS) based assessment for pesticide exposures that links state-mandated information on type, date, and location of all agricultural pesticide applications in California recorded since 1974 to land use maps and study participants' residences and work places. Here we propose to combine a powerful new metabolomics tool and system biology analytic methods to identify signatures for toxic exposures that evoke long-term biologic responses. The metabolomics data we will generate will help us identify metabolic profiles for chronic environmental exposures for both PD patients and population controls. This will generate a first understanding of the metabolic consequences of chronic low dose pesticide exposure in PD. However, biologic processes, including biologic responses to chronic toxicant exposures and those involved in disease development, are highly dynamic and interactive systems. The PEG study is uniquely capable to begin investigating these multidimensional networks linking exposure and disease. We have already generated genome and epigenome profiles for 550 PD patients and 250 controls. Here we newly propose to generate and analyze serum based metabolome profiles (targeted and untargeted) for these same 800 study participants characterizing environmental pesticide exposures via metabolome wide association analyses. We aim to develop a metabolite signature of environmental exposure using supervised machine learning methods, and also determine if these are disease specific or found in both exposed cases and controls. Furthermore, incorporating our genome and epigenome information, we propose to use biological systems analysis to identify multi-omics network patterns that distinguish environmental exposures that contribute to PD onset and progression. We expect this to show a chronic response pattern across different molecular layers and are influenced by many environmental factors. Combining multi-omic measures based on multidimensional network and system analyses will address the gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD. Project Narrative Here we propose to build upon a unique resource - the PEG population-based Parkinson's disease (PD) study - to identify metabolic signatures of chronic environmental exposures and disease in 550 PD patients and 250 population controls. Importantly, we plan to integrate exposure and effect markers across multiple molecular layers (genome, epigenome, metabolome), with the goal to obtain a more holistic understanding of molecular changes due to chronic environmental exposures. Our approach incorporates multi-omics measures and multidimensional network and system analyses to address gaps in our current knowledge concerning molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of chronic low dose exposures in PD.","Environment, Metabolomics, and PD",9858332,R21ES030175,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Anions', 'Archives', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Caffeine', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Chronic', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier Transform', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Characteristics', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Onset of illness', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pesticides', 'Population', 'Population Control', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Policy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specialist', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'agricultural pesticide', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'brain health', 'case control', 'cell type', 'disorder control', 'disorder risk', 'environmental pesticide exposure', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'innovation', 'land use', 'machine learning method', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'pesticide exposure', 'population based', 'residence', 'response', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'transcription factor']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2020,234000,0.05146523442237858
"The Impact of Air Pollution Exposure on COVID-19 Severity and Mortality PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently the most emergent public health disaster of the entire world. COVID-19 disproportionately affects older adults, people having history of smoking and comorbidities like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension. There is no vaccine and treatment for COVID-19, therefore, public health interventions have been taken to control disease transmission. Also, searching modifiable environmental factors that can help reduce the COVID-19 severity and mortality is crucial. Air pollution exposure has been shown to have a systemic effect on the human body including lung function impairment and immune alterations. Recent two ecologic studies from Europe and the United States have suggested that higher long-term ambient air pollution exposure (PM2.5 and NO2) significantly contributes to the COVID-19 mortality. These findings from aggregated data of air pollution exposure and total number of deaths in large geographic areas need to be further verified by cohort study with individual data of air pollution exposure and COVID-19 case progression and mortality. Also, susceptibility factors such as low social economic status (SES), race/ethnicity, smoking exposures and comorbidities need to be accounted for in the analysis. To address the urgent public health question about the role of air pollution exposure in COVID-19 progression, we propose to conduct a retrospective cohort study based on the existing EMR data of all COVID- 19 cases (n>7000) diagnosed at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) medical centers. Specific aims of this proposal have been expanded from our ongoing NIEHS-supported R01 study investigating prenatal air pollution exposure and children's autism risk among 440,000 KPSC mother-child pairs (APAR study, 1R01ES029963). In this proposal, the main outcomes of interest are COVID-19 severity assessed by hospitalization, ICU admission and ventilator use, as well as death. Details dates will be available through EMR. Natural language processing technologies will be applied to identify the date of first COVID-19 symptom onset for each case. Thereafter, the earliest date among COVID-19 symptom onset and clinical diagnosis will be used as the study entry date. Then short- and long-term air pollution exposure will be estimated for each case by averaging air pollution exposure levels during one-month and one-year before the study entry date. Both ambient (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3) and traffic-related (line dispersion model estimated NOx) air pollution exposure will be assessed based on individual residential addresses. Detailed residential history of all KPSC members have been well-maintained by the KPSC system. Key covariates including age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking exposure, body mass index, comorbidities, medication use, and meteorological data will be extracted to control for confounding and identify susceptible high risk subgroups. With the unique cohort data resource and world-renowned epidemiologists and exposure scientists, this one-year study will greatly enhance our knowledge about the effect of air pollution exposure on COVID-19 progression and death. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study is proposed in response to the urgent need of large cohort studies investigating the contributions of environment such as air pollution exposure to the COVID-19 epidemic and mortality.

"Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs As the U.S. population ages, there is growing concern about the loss of mental acuity associated with aging. Even small deficits are considered intermediates between normal cognitive attrition and severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Mild cognitive impairment, which affects ~10% of those ≥65 years, has a 56% conversion rate to dementia over 4 years. Because of dementia’s strong age dependence, merely delaying its onset could have a dramatic impact. A 5-year delay in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease would lead to ~4 million fewer cases in the U.S. The lack of biomarkers that reflect adverse exposures and preclinical effects dramatically limits opportunities for effective targeted prevention.  Environmental exposures that augment systemic inflammation, such as ambient air pollution and metals, have been shown to hasten cognitive aging by as much as 5 years. We also recently showed that long term exposure to air pollution is associated with Alzheimer's disease incidence. Our goal is to identify new biomarkers that reflect environmental influences and predict the risk of impaired cognition. We will leverage experimental and clinical evidence on extracellular vesicles (EVs)—i.e., tiny membrane-bound vesicles actively released by tissue cells into the bloodstream—and of their bioactive cargo of micro (miRNAs) and long (lncRNAs) noncoding RNAs, which can signal inflammatory responses via their potent capacity for gene regulation. Animal and human studies have shown that environmental exposures induce the release of pro-inflammatory EVs into the bloodstream. Recent clinical data also show that changes in blood EV biomarkers precede and predict cognitive impairment. In particular, a small, but highly suggestive, case-control study identified EV-miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, relative to controls, which were used—by means of a machine learning model (which we will also employ)—to identify early preclinical risk of Alzheimer’s disease.  In the proposed studies, we will leverage the resources of well-phenotyped longitudinal cohorts. First, in the Normative Aging Study, we will access ready-to-use longitudinal collections of biospecimens, exposure data, and cognitive function measurements from four serial visits over 12 years of follow up. We hypothesize that environmental exposures to air pollution and metals, individually and as mixtures, will be associated with significantly higher numbers of EVs and differential EV size (Aim 1). We further hypothesize that the levels of and longitudinal changes in EV-encapsulated miRNAs and lncRNAs reflect current and past environmental exposures and predict subsequent cognitive decline (Aim 2). Finally, we will use machine learning and mediation analysis to determine the roles of circulating EVs and their noncoding RNA cargo on the biological pathways linking environmental exposures to cognitive decline (Aim 3). We will validate all findings in the KORA cohort, which has similar design and data. Our work may yield a model for other potentially modifiable risk factors for impaired cognition and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as for additional age-related diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT The limited availability of predictors of cognitive decline is a critical gap identified in the 2015 DHHS priorities that, if not addressed soon, will leave the U.S. population unprotected from the current exponential growth of socioeconomic burden from impaired cognition in older individuals. The proposed research will identify novel biomarkers that accurately reflect adverse environmental influences and detect the beginnings of cognitive decline before it manifests fully. Due to the central roles that EVs play in inflammation and tissue signaling, this study could provide a model that can be extended to additional risk factors of cognitive decline, as well as to other chronic diseases of aging.","Air Particulate, Metals, and Cognitive Performance in an Aging Cohort- Roles of Circulating Extracellular Vesicles and Non-coding RNAs",9981740,R01ES027747,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animals', 'Arsenic', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cadmium', 'Carbon', 'Carbon Black', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Encapsulated', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exposure to', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Membrane', 'Mercury', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metals', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Nitrates', 'Particulate', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'RNA marker', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Suggestion', 'Sulfate', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Trace Elements', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vesicle', 'Visit', 'Work', 'age related', 'ambient air pollution', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'design', 'extracellular vesicles', 'follow-up', 'inflammatory marker', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'modifiable risk', 'novel marker', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'toxic metal']",NIEHS,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2020,757233,0.010411492765826593
"Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children Asthma is a chronic heterogeneous airway disorder characterized by inflammation, mucus hypersecretion, airway hyperreactivity, and impaired airflow. Severe exacerbations of asthma occur frequently in children and require immediate use of systemic steroid therapy to prevent serious outcomes such as hospitalization or death. In addition to direct health risks, pediatric asthma exerts a substantial cost burden, as asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalization, and missed school days. Multiple environmental factors are purported to play a role in asthma symptoms, including aeroallergens, pollutants, weather changes, and community viral outbreaks such as influenza. Additionally, asthma prevalence is greater in children of low socioeconomic status (SES) and in African-American and Hispanic/Latino children, suggesting both environmental and genetic effects on asthma incidence and severity. The existence of geographical asthma “hotspots” indicates that asthma prevalence and severity are influenced by place-based risks, including local air quality, built environment factors, access to health care providers, socioeconomic factors, culture, and behavior. To effectively prevent and treat pediatric asthma attacks, it is necessary to understand how patient-specific characteristics interact with environmental factors to render an individual susceptible to severe asthma exacerbations. Lacking sufficient power, previous studies have largely examined suspected asthma triggers in isolation; thus, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding how environmental factors interact with each other and with patient-level factors to promote severe asthma exacerbations in pediatric populations. We hypothesize that a longitudinal analysis of environmental exposures and patient-level factors will elucidate new multifactorial causes of severe asthma exacerbations. To elucidate the contributions and interactions of environmental and patient-level factors, we will apply machine learning approaches to a longitudinal (2007-2017) geocoded database of patient electronic health records detailing asthma-related health encounters and publicly available, overlapping spatiotemporal environmental data. Further, we will evaluate the interactions between person-level clinical factors, including obesity, history of premature birth/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and atopy, to determine their effects on susceptibility to selected environmental triggers. These analyses will 1) provide an analysis of the relative contribution and interactions of environmental factors to pediatric asthma exacerbations, 2) identify geographic hotspots of asthma prevalence and severity, and 3) determine how person-level clinical factors influence susceptibility to different asthma triggers. Our findings will provide new insights into risk factors for severe asthma exacerbations, spur new studies into the biological mechanisms that underlie the interactions between human biology and the environment, inform preventive strategies and patient education efforts, and serve as a model that can be expanded to larger cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma affects 1 in 10 children in the United States, and severe asthma exacerbations require immediate medical attention to prevent hospitalization or death. A wide variety of environmental triggers such as pollutants and allergens are associated with asthma symptoms, but the interaction between different environmental triggers and person-level characteristics such as obesity, allergy, and history of premature birth are unclear. These studies will use longitudinal, overlapping asthma patient and environmental data to understand the role of different environmental triggers in asthma exacerbations in order to develop new preventive and therapeutic strategies for asthma.",Multifactorial spatiotemporal analyses to evaluate environmental triggers and patient-level clinical characteristics of severe asthma exacerbations in children,9884782,R21HL145415,"['Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Air', 'Air Movements', 'Allergens', 'Asthma', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fibrinogen', 'Food', 'Genetic', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Hispanics', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human Biology', 'Humidity', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Influenza', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Latino', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neighborhoods', 'North Carolina', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Pollen', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Rural', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Steroid therapy', 'Symptoms', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Visit', 'Weather', 'airborne allergen', 'airway hyperresponsiveness', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'deprivation', 'electronic data', 'health care availability', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal analysis', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning method', 'medical attention', 'mucus hypersecretion', 'novel', 'pediatric emergency', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'respiratory virus', 'response', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urgent care', 'violent crime']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,120750,0.1651455573086637
"Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood PROJECT SUMMARY This K08 proposal describes a comprehensive training program tailored to the career development of the candidate. The candidate is a physician who recently completed a clinical fellowship in Allergy and Immunology and whose research contributions to date have addressed early-life risk factors for childhood asthma and allergy with a focus on the diet and intestinal microenvironment. Asthma and environmental allergies have increased in prevalence and asthma is now the most common chronic disease in children. The increased occurrence of asthma and allergy has been attributed to changes including dietary shifts and dysbiosis, though contributory factors are incompletely defined and interventions to prevent asthma and allergy remain elusive. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (FA) have well-defined immunologic effects, and the ratio of omega-6:omega-3 FA intake has increased concurrently with the increase in allergic disease. However, reported associations of PUFA with asthma and allergy in childhood are inconsistent. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that effects of PUFA are impacted by host genotype and the intestinal microbiota. Our scientific goal is to examine these omics to identify determinants of when a safe and inexpensive intervention, intake of PUFA, is effective in reducing asthma and allergy in childhood. We will utilize data from 6- and 7-year-old participants in three study populations: Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), Project Viva and Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC). We have three specific aims: (1) Identify gene by omega-3 FA interactions in asthma and allergy in childhood; (2): Define the contributions of intestinal bacteria and metabolites to associations of omega-3 FA dietary intake with asthma and allergy in childhood; and (3) Characterize clinically relevant childhood plasma PUFA profiles using unsupervised classification methods and integrative machine learning algorithms. Our findings could lead to cost-effective and personalized approaches to asthma and allergy reduction by elucidating which individuals benefit from dietary PUFA supplementation and whether microbiota-modifying therapies could boost protective responses to PUFA. The candidate proposes to execute this research plan alongside a training and development plan including hands-on bioinformatics instruction and preparation for independent mechanistic and clinical R01-level follow-up projects. The proposed work will be mentored by Dr. Scott Weiss, a Professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in environmental, nutritional and genetic asthma risk factors. The candidate will obtain additional scientific input and career guidance from a team including a co-mentor and three scientific advisors with expertise in asthma epidemiology, lipid mediators of allergic inflammation, multi-omics analysis and translational research methods. This proposal represents a natural continuation of the candidate’s prior experience and will provided the support needed for her to become an independent investigator with a focus on precision medicine approaches to asthma and allergy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are dietary fats with effects on immune function and inflammation, and the genes that a person is born with or the bacteria that live in one’s gut could influence how the body processes and responds to PUFA. We will study children to see if having particular gene variants or specific gut bacteria or chemicals impacts how PUFA intake relates to risk of asthma and allergy. Understanding how genetic, microbial, and other factors influence PUFA processing and asthma and allergies could lead to new cost- effective ways to prevent and treat these increasingly common and clinically burdensome diseases.",Multi-Omics Analysis of the Association of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids with Asthma and Allergy in Childhood,10009430,K08HL148178,"['3 year old', '7 year old', 'Address', 'Allergic', 'Allergic Disease', 'Allergic inflammation', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Asthma', 'Bacteria', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Availability', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Diet', 'Dietary Fats', 'Dietary Fatty Acid', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Fellowship', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Instruction', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Multiomic Data', 'Omega-3 Fatty Acids', 'Omega-6 Fatty Acids', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Probiotics', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'defined contribution', 'dysbiosis', 'environmental allergy', 'experience', 'fatty acid supplementation', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'gut bacteria', 'gut microbiota', 'immune function', 'learning strategy', 'lipid mediator', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'multiple omics', 'nutrition related genetics', 'personalized approach', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'professor', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'study population', 'western diet']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,170640,0.12874247805660466
"Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design Patients, clinicians, and policymakers often need valid information about the real-world effects of drugs and other exposures for which there have been pronounced time-trends in use. For example, the rapid growth in the use of rofecoxib in the early 2000s and of exogenous testosterone from 2000–2013 was accompanied by an urgent need for knowledge about the cardiovascular effects of those drugs. Randomized trials seldom enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or follow them long enough, to examine associations with rare outcomes. Therefore, non-randomized studies are needed, even though they are susceptible to unmeasured confounding and other forms of bias. To address these limitations of available epidemiologic designs, we recently introduced the trend-in-trend design: a novel, hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic research design that is applicable when there is a prominent trend in the use of the study exposure. Substantial additional development is needed to realize the full public health impact of the trend-in-trend research design. Areas in most need of development include: evaluation of a sequential analysis extension for real-time post-marketing safety surveillance; evaluation of machine learning to specify the trend-in-trend design’s underlying cumulative probability of exposure model; evaluation of dose-response relationships; and evaluation of treatment effect heterogeneity based on baseline patient characteristics. For each of these methodologic needs, we propose an approach for which we will: 1) assess its statistical properties, in particular large-sample validity through asymptotics and finite sample statistical power; 2) evaluate its performance in thorough simulation studies; and 3) proof-test the approach using the known association between rofecoxib-acute myocardial infarction in healthcare data. Finally, we will apply these developments to the unresolved and highly important question of the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic effects of exogenous testosterone in men. This study will have broad scientific, clinical, and public health impact by greatly extending the utility of a novel epidemiologic research design with demonstrated validity and is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. It will also evaluate the safety of exogenous testosterone, a question of tremendous clinical and public health importance. Examining the safety of prescription drugs is one enormously important application of this design that has the potential to benefit many millions of people. As the trend-in-trend design is also applicable to non-drug exposures that have a pronounced time-trend (e.g., medical procedures, lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, etc.), its potential impact on the population is even broader. This project will enhance the utility of the trend-in-trend research design, a novel hybrid epidemiologic-ecologic design that is applicable to a broad range of exposures with a prominent trend in use. Further, we will leverage these methods developments to study the cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and thromboembolic safety of exogenous testosterone, unanswered questions of tremendous clinical and public health importance for older adult males.",Enhancing the Utility of the Trend-in-Trend Research Design,10017817,R01AG064589,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Calendar', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Research Design', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Observational Study', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research Design', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'To specify', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'base', 'cerebrovascular', 'cohort', 'cyclooxygenase 2', 'design', 'improved', 'lifestyle factors', 'male', 'men', 'method development', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'population health', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'time use', 'treatment effect', 'trend', 'trend analysis', 'venous thromboembolism']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,549226,0.0314644330070353
"Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status Abstract Exposures to extreme events are increasingly common in many parts of the globe as a function of changes in weather patterns combined with rising sea levels, but there is a paucity of data to support scientific research on the implications of such exposures for population health and well-being over the long-term. STAR, the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery, is a unique exception. We have interviewed respondents from 10 months before the December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami for 10 years. This project will follow up the same respondents 15 years after the tsunami. The pre-tsunami baseline is a population-representative survey of 27,000 individuals who were living along the coast of Aceh and North Sumatra, Indonesia. The tsunami constitutes a large-scale, unanticipated natural disaster in an area that was not thought to be prone to tsunamis. Moreover, its impacts were spatially idiosyncratic across the study area. Whether a particular community was inundated by the waves depended on a combination of the wave direction, seabed and shoreline topography. Of 368 baseline communities, about a fifth were devastated, a third were somewhat damaged and the rest were not directly affected. These features of the natural experiment provide the basis for identifying causal impacts of this major natural disaster which killed 170,000 people in the study area. The baseline and six post-tsunami waves collected during the prior phase of this project provide detailed information about exposure to and experience of the disaster and the evolution of health and wellbeing, broadly defined, for baseline respondents who survived the tsunami plus new household members. In each follow-up, we have interviewed 95% of all baseline survivors. In this continuation we will re-interview all baseline survivors and their household members fifteen years after the tsunami. We will place these data in the public domain, adding to prior waves of STAR already in the public domain to create an unparalleled data resource for the scientific community. Focusing on those who were exposed to the tsunami as children (age <12y and in utero at the time), we will investigate the impacts of tsunami exposure on the evolution of health, education and cognitive performance, linking outcomes to changes in material and psycho-social resources at the family level as well as community level resources. The latter will be measured combining administrative data and information extracted from satellite imagery using machine learning. Longer-term impacts, fifteen years after the tsunami, will exploit innovative human capital measures including biomarkers, executive function and emotional reactivity. Loss of one or both parents is among the most extreme exposures. We will explore the causal effects of orphanhood by comparing children who lost parents in the tsunami with those in the same community who did not. Project Narrative This project will field the fifteen year follow up of the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and Recovery (STAR), a large-scale longitudinal study of individuals differentially exposed to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The data provide unique information on the evolution of population health of a group of 27,000 individuals first interviewed before the tsunami, including biomarker measurements and integrated information on environmental change.",Longer term effects of a natural disaster on health and socio-economic status,10052164,R01HD052762,"['Adolescence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Categories', 'Censuses', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Child Welfare', 'Cicatrix', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Data', 'Disasters', 'Documentation', 'Earthquakes', 'Education', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Health education', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Household', 'Imagery', 'Indian Ocean', 'Individual', 'Indonesia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Natural Disasters', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Privatization', 'Public Domains', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respondent', 'Rest', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Shock', 'Siblings', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Sumatra', 'Surveys', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Tsunami', 'Variant', 'Water', 'acetone hydrazone', 'adverse childhood events', 'behavioral response', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'design', 'emerging adult', 'environmental change', 'executive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health economics', 'human capital', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'member', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'sea level rise', 'success', 'tool', 'weather patterns', 'young adult']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,544239,0.008652749393263711
"Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management Abstract  The study will develop more accurate, computational predictive models and a novel automatic explanation function to better identify patients likely to benefit most from care management. For many chronic diseases, a small portion of patients with high vulnerabilities, severe disease, or great barriers to care consume most healthcare resources and costs. To improve outcomes and resource use, many healthcare systems use predictive models to prospectively identify high-risk patients and enroll them in care management to implement tailored care plans. For maximal benefit from costly care management with limited service capacity, only patients at the highest risk should be enrolled. But, current patient identification approaches have two limitations: 1) Low prediction accuracy causes misclassification, wasted costs, and suboptimal care. If an existing model  were used for care management allocation, enrollment would miss >50% of those who would benefit most  but include others unlikely to benefit. A healthcare system often has insufficient data for model training and  incomplete data on many patients. A typical model uses only a few risk factors for adverse outcomes, despite  many being known. Also, many predictive variables on patient and system characteristics are not found yet. 2) No explanation of the reasons for a prediction causes poor adoption of the prediction and busy care  managers to spend extra time and miss suitable interventions. Care managers need to understand why a  patient is predicted to be at high risk before allocating to care management and forming a tailored care plan.  Existing models rarely give such explanation, forcing care managers to do detailed patient chart reviews.  To address the limitations and optimize care management for more high-risk patients to receive appropriate care, the study will: a) improve accuracy of computationally identifying high-risk patients and assess potential impact on outcomes; b) automate explanation of computational prediction results and assess impact on model accuracy and outcomes; c) assess automatic explanations' impact on care managers' acceptance of the predictions and perceived care plan quality. The use case will be asthma that affects 9% of Americans and incurs 439,000 hospitalizations, 1.8 million emergency room visits, and $56 billion in cost annually. Asthma experts and computer scientists will use data from three leading healthcare systems; a novel, model-based transfer learning technique needing no other system's raw data; a novel, pattern-based automatic explanation technique that also improves model generalizability and accuracy; a new data source PreManage to make patient data more complete; and novel features on patient and system characteristics. These techniques can advance clinical machine learning for various applications, improve patient identification, and help form tailored care plans. Focus groups will be conducted with clinicians to explore generalizing the techniques to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and heart diseases, on whom care management is also needed. The results will potentially transform care management for better outcomes and more efficient resource use. Narrative  Care management is widely used in managing asthma patients. The proposed new techniques will boost the performance of patient identification and care plan development for care management, leading to improved clinical outcomes and more efficient healthcare resource use.",Using Computational Approaches to Optimize Asthma Care Management,9982399,R01HL142503,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Air', 'American', 'Asthma', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drops', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physicians&apos', ' Offices', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Weather', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'asthmatic patient', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'care costs', 'computer science', 'cost', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'simulation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,792540,0.05508941278794352
"Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD Prenatal levels of organophosphorus pesticide (OPs) biomarkers have been associated with hallmark symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), including deficits in working memory, social responsiveness, and ADHD indices. Cross-sectional studies have also linked concurrent pyrethroid pesticide metabolites with ADHD and ADHD behaviors in children. Toxicology studies report mixture effects for these pesticides on health outcomes. Three major gaps exist in this literature: 1) No studies have evaluated prenatal and childhood exposures to these pesticides and clinical ADHD diagnoses. 2) Prenatal epidemiological studies of OPs/pyrethroids typically rely on urinary DAP biomarkers, which reflect ingestion of both non-toxic metabolites and toxic parent pesticides. Urinary biomarkers from spot urine samples also do not characterize pregnancy-wide exposures, since OPs and pyrethroids are rapidly metabolized. 3) Studies of pesticide mixtures in epidemiology are scarce, and use of biomarkers for such mixtures analysis is problematic. For instance, administration of chlorpyrifos (an OP) results in increased tissue concentrations of cypermethrin while reducing urinary excretion of the pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxbenzoic acid. Thus, the mixture itself may affect biomarker levels and increase exposure misclassification. A geospatial framework for pesticide exposure can address some of the limitations of urinary biomarkers: exposures from agricultural pesticide applications can be estimated for an entire pregnancy rather than a few days; estimates reflect the toxic parent pesticide rather than non-toxic OP metabolites; and estimates reflect actual exposures rather than a post-metabolism level. However, geospatial (GIS) methods of pesticide exposure assessment for epidemiology in the US have only been done in California, and usually rely on distance-to-field measures. GIS exposure may be enhanced with drift models that incorporate heat, humidity, inversions, atmospheric stability, and wind, while external validity may be increased by studying a population outside of California. We propose to assess the relationship between OPs, pyrethroids, and ADHD in an Arizona population. To identify a study population, we will apply a validated phenotyping algorithm with exceptional diagnostics to Arizona Medicaid records to identify 4,000 childhood ADHD cases and 16,000 controls. In the mentored phase, the Candidate will develop geospatial, phenotyping, exposure assessment, mixture modeling (Bayesian Kernel Machine regression [BKMR]), and machine learning skills while constructing the case-control study. In the R00 phase, the Candidate will compare the drift model against traditional distance-to-field measures in a frequentist framework (Aim 2), and model associations between prenatal OP and pyrethroid pesticide mixtures and ADHD with BKMR (Aim 3). These results will expand GIS studies beyond California, contribute to sparse but critical literature on pesticide mixtures and neurodevelopment, and be among the first to report associations between GIS estimates of prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD case status. Public Health Relevance Statement/Narrative The goal of this career development award is to launch Dr. Melissa Furlong’s independent research career in environmental exposures and chronic disease epidemiology, with expertise in geospatial and dispersion modeling. In the research phase, Dr. Furlong will estimate associations between prenatal pesticide exposures and ADHD, and will also estimate whether two classes of pesticides exhibit synergistic interaction effects. Findings from this proposal will provide some of the first estimates of associations between GIS-based estimates of pesticides and ADHD case status, and will contribute to a critical epidemiological literature on pesticide mixture effects and childhood neurodevelopment.",Prenatal Exposure to Pesticide Mixtures and Childhood ADHD,10238415,R00ES028743,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agriculture', 'Arizona', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth Certificates', 'California', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chlorpyrifos', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'County', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Wind', 'Epidemiology', 'Excretory function', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Ingestion', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Melissa', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Permethrin', 'Pesticides', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicant exposure', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Urine', 'aged', 'agricultural pesticide', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'cypermethrin', 'early childhood', 'epidemiology study', 'indexing', 'knowledge base', 'neurodevelopment', 'pesticide exposure', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pyrethroid', 'social', 'study population', 'urinary']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R00,2020,248998,-0.0034033519347968074
"Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater Project Summary / Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a naturally-occurring metal contaminant found in water supplies throughout the world. Although research using small samples (< 400 observations) from Bangladesh, China and Canada suggests that excessive consumption of Mn is neurotoxic in infants and young children, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) classifies Mn only as a secondary contaminant. Thus, Mn is not subject to mandatory monitoring in public water systems, let alone private wells, which serve over 2 million Californians while remaining unregulated and untreated. To reconcile the gap between epidemiological evidence and regulatory action, we propose this timely research. Our project, which takes California’s private wells as a focal point for its investigation, has three specific aims: to identify (1) areas at high risk of exposure to Mn in drinking water (2) the socioeconomic characteristics of communities at high-risk of Mn exposure, and (3) the degree of association between Mn exposure and the health outcomes of infants and young children. While treatment for Mn-contaminated water is technologically straightforward, access may depend on a community’s socioeconomic and political status; thus, there is danger of Mn silently amplifying health inequalities. The ​broader, long-term objectives of this research are (I) to encourage further analyses of Mn exposure in California by developing a statewide publicly-available dataset from groundwater Mn data, and (II) to develop a ​causal ​framework for a primary-sample study of Mn effects on infant and child health. California enforces the US EPA’s secondary contaminant standard of 50 µg L​-1 but only in community water systems. Non-transient, non-community water systems (e.g. schools and hospitals) and private wells are exempt. In recent years, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has found Mn concentrations above the health-based target of 300 µg L​-1 in California’s wells. ​The proposed research will indicate whether and to what extent Mn affects child health and contributes to health disparities. As such, it is aligned with the NIEHS mission to determine how environmental exposures affect humans in order to promote healthier lives. To achieve the first aim of identifying areas at high risk of exposure to unsafe concentrations of Mn, we will use a machine learning model on subsurface flow and groundwater chemistry to predict Mn concentrations in the Central Valley, Los Angeles, Central Coast and West Coast Basins; then, we will overlay the Mn prediction grid with ZIP code and school district polygons to identify the areas that emerge with more than a 50% chance of exposure to Mn at the secondary standard as high-risk. For the second aim, we will determine if high-risk areas are distinguished from low-risk areas by their socioeconomic status and demographics using two-sample t-tests. For the third aim, we will run least squares regressions of birth weight, grade-by-school test scores and chronic absenteeism rates on predicted Mn exposure with controls for chemical confounds, socioeconomic status and demographic characteristics. Project Narrative The impact of manganese (Mn) on population health is an under-investigated problem in the United States relative to the wide prevalence and frequent detections of the chemical above safe concentrations in groundwater basins throughout the country. In line with NIEHS priorities to better understand environmental health disparities and to aid in securing environmental justice, we propose to correct this knowledge gap by undertaking a substantial investigation into the prevalence of Mn in California’s private wells, and examining the shared characteristics of communities most likely to be exposed to unsafe levels of manganese in drinking water. By also performing a preliminary investigation of the relationship between Mn exposure and child cognitive health, our study will provide an initial assessment of the public health threat from Mn, highlight the most vulnerable communities, and inform regulatory agencies seeking to review drinking water standards for Mn.",Human Exposure and Vulnerability to Manganese Contaminated Groundwater,9978510,R21ES030807,"['Absenteeism', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Asia', 'Bangladesh', 'Birth Weight', 'California', 'Canada', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'China', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disadvantaged', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Esthetics', 'Exposure to', 'Geological Survey', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impaired health', 'Infant', 'Infant Health', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Los Angeles', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Machine Learning', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Metals', 'Micronutrients', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Politics', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Students', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Vital Statistics', 'Water', 'Water Supply', 'base', 'contaminated water', 'demographics', 'drinking water', 'econometrics', 'elementary school', 'environmental justice', 'ethnic minority population', 'experimental study', 'exposed human population', 'ground water', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'infant outcome', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neurotoxic', 'novel', 'physical conditioning', 'population health', 'school district', 'socioeconomics', 'web site']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA RIVERSIDE,R21,2020,224680,0.032729339612650926
"CHABMAP (Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Analyses Platform) technology automates the quantification of toxic CyanoHABs exposure epochs for any waterbody. Specific Aim #1: Operationalize spatio-temporal CyanoHAB exposure epoch metrics  • Fuse multi-scale and disparate satellite remote sensing platforms and automate retrievals over  space and time to derive CyanoHAB exposure metrics. We will build enterprise software to fully  automate the harmonization and fusion of NASA’s Landsat-8 OLI and ESA’s Sentinel-2 and  Sentinel-3 satellite platforms to provide long-term (1984-present) moderate spatial resolution  (30meter pixels) and high temporal frequency CyanoHAB exposure metrics (Cyanobacteria  Intensity, Color Dissolved Organic Matter, Total Suspended Solids, Floating Algae Index,  Chlorophyll-a Concentration, & toxins). The decision support tool automates epoch synthesis to  understand incubation periods and exposure triggers for neurodegenerative diseases. Specific Aim #2: Scale on-demand CHABMAP commercial product services  • Scale and implement CHABMAP data services for infinite scalability using BigData cloud  technologies. This Aim involves three main development efforts: adapting our proprietary  Geospatial Image and Processing System (GIPS) capabilities to an AWS-deployable auto-scaling  cluster, creation of user interfaces and application programming interfaces (APIs) to interact with  these services, and enhancements to the base GIPS framework to facilitate intercommunication  between remote GIPS-enabled archives and the cloud processing streams. This includes the  creation of deployable compute instances, optimization of computation and parallelization  specific to AWS deployment, optimization of temporary and long-term storage of intermediate  products, and optimization of communication and data transfer with end users.

"Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT) PROJECT SUMMARY Evidence suggests that exposure to Superfund chemicals contributes to adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), including preterm birth (PTB). Rates of PTB and infant mortality in Puerto Rico (PR) are among the highest of all US states and territories. There are 18 Superfund sites in PR, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Moreover, extreme weather events (hurricanes, flooding) may result in elevated exposures to Superfund chemicals. The PROTECT center has brought together researchers from Northeastern University, the University of Puerto Rico, University of Georgia, and the University of Michigan to provide much needed understanding of the relationship and the mechanisms by which exposure to suspect chemicals contribute to APOs, and to develop new methods to reduce risk of exposure in PR and beyond. To do this, PROTECT uses a source-to-outcome structure, integrating epidemiological (Project 1), toxicological (Project 2), fate and transport (Project 3), and remediation (Project 4) studies, a unified sampling infrastructure, a centralized indexed data repository, and a sophisticated data management system. Since its inception in 2010, PROTECT has built detailed and extensive data sets on environmental conditions and prenatal conditions of 1457 pregnant mothers (exposure, socioeconomic and health data–close to 3000 data points per participant), yielding a cohort of 1210 live births in northern PR. In the renewal, PROTECT will recruit and follow an additional 1000 study participants, yielding a cohort of 800+ live births for an ultimate total cohort of 2000+ completed live births. PROTECT has documented significant contamination of northern PR drinking water and has found compelling preliminary epidemiologic and mechanistic toxicology associations between Superfund chemicals and APOs. PROTECT research has focused on chlorinated volatile organic compounds and phthalates and their role in PTB. The PROTECT renewal will broaden its scope, employing a data-driven approach to study and reduce the impact of exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites in karst regions on APOs in Puerto Rico’s underserved, highly-exposed population. Target chemicals will be expanded to include metals, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We will investigate the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies will be developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT renewal will also focus on oxidative stress as an underlying biological pathway by which contaminant exposure can lead to APOs. New statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools will be developed to allow PROTECT researchers to analyze our datasets. PROTECT will employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report- back data, and communicate with stakeholders. A broad suite of training and professional activities will be provided to trainees, individually tailored to the trainees’ needs and goals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reproductive health has been at the forefront of Puerto Ricans’ health concerns as rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all U.S. states and territories. The PROTECT SRC is exploring the link between exposure to a mixture of suspect chemicals from Superfund sites and adverse pregnancy outcomes in Puerto Rico, and is working to reduce that exposure. Improved understanding of the link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and contamination, together with developing sustainable technologies to reduce risk, will help improve health outcomes in Puerto Rico (a disadvantaged population) and beyond.",Puerto Rico Testsite for Exploring Contamination Threats (PROTECT),9839906,P42ES017198,"['Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Floods', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Hurricane', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infrastructure', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxidative Stress Pathway', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pesticides', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health Practice', 'Puerto Rican', 'Puerto Rico', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Superfund', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Water', 'Water Purification', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'community involvement', 'contaminant transport', 'contaminated drinking water', 'contaminated water', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'disadvantaged population', 'drinking water', 'experience', 'extreme weather', 'ground water', 'health data', 'human model', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'new technology', 'novel', 'phthalates', 'portability', 'prenatal', 'recruit', 'remediation', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'sound', 'superfund chemical', 'superfund site', 'tissue culture', 'toxicant', 'volatile organic compound', 'water treatment']",NIEHS,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,P42,2020,2414074,0.022972664311122035
"Developing a mechanistic neurobiological model of exposure therapy response based on fear extinction theory Project Summary I am applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to support my development into an independently funded translational clinical psychologist. My long-term career goal is to conduct a program of research that translates neurobiological models of anxiety and its treatment into guidance for real- life clinical decision-making. Currently, although exposure therapy is the best available treatment for anxiety disorders, 25% of patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and we do not know why. A critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. Because the mechanism of exposure therapy is thought to be extinction learning, the proposed research aims to address this goal by directly linking exposure therapy response to extinction learning in a sample of adults with social anxiety disorder. Specifically, I aim to identify neurobiological features of extinction learning that predict successful recall, are associated with clinical symptoms, and predict therapy response. The project will use a paradigm that I developed and piloted to assess physiological and neuroimaging measures of extinction learning. The expected outcomes are an innovative mechanistic neurobiological model that can identify patients at risk of non-response, as well as specific, testable hypotheses for how to improve outcomes for these patients. In order for this project, and my broader career goals, to succeed, it is imperative that I have expertise related to exposure therapy, predictive modeling, analysis of self-report, physiological, and fMRI data, and traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. I already have expertise in the theory and implementation of exposure therapy, as well as the analysis of self-report and fMRI data. This K23 award would allow me to receive advanced training in (1) machine learning techniques for building and evaluating clinically relevant predictive models, (2) specific skills for analysis and interpretation of physiological data, and (3) traditional and biomarker-guided clinical trials. I have assembled an inter-disciplinary team of mentors at Stanford University that are ideally suited to guide my research and training. Dr. Leanne Williams (primary mentor, Department of Psychiatry) will provide expertise on using neurobiology to make treatment outcome predictions, and provide overall career development mentorship throughout the project. Dr. James Gross (co-mentor, Department of Psychology) will provide expertise on physiological data and its integration with self-report and fMRI data. Dr. Tze Lai (co-mentor, Department of Statistics) will provide expertise on predictive models and biomarker-guided clinical trial designs. The training and associated research will take place in the Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Department at Stanford University, a world renowned hub of neuroscience and psychiatry research, and at Stanford's Center for Cognitive and Neurobiological Imaging, a state-of-the-art neuroimaging facility. Project Narrative Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available, as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been little application towards improved clinical outcomes.

"Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Su H. Chu, PhD, MS is a biostatistician and molecular epidemiologist with strong and substantial commitments to integrative omic research in respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. Her career objective is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing and applying novel statistical methods and multiomic network approaches that facilitate mechanistic understanding of the intersection of respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. This proposal combines Dr. Chu’s extensive training in integrative omic methods development, along with her experience in genetic and metabolomic research, to examine the integrative metabolomic etiology of asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder overlap (AAO). A wealth of epidemiological literature has revealed with remarkable consistency that asthmatic patients are at greater risk for ADHD, and vice versa, with a number of longitudinal studies of childhood asthma indicating excess risk of ADHD in adolescence and adulthood. However, no studies have directly interrogated the biological mechanisms by which these conditions may be related. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that childhood asthma and ADHD share both common and distinct dysregulated metabolic processes, some of which may have drivers that are genetic in origin. This will be explored using existing genetic and metabolomic data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC), three large prospective cohorts of children with extensive longitudinal phenotyping and multiple omic data types, by identifying metabolites and metabolic profiles associated with AAO (aim 1), constructing multiomic models and features that characterize dysregulated metabolic processes and their upstream drivers in AAO (aim 2), and validation and replication of all findings (aim 3). As Dr. Chu completes these aims, her career development program will facilitate the achievement of her primary training goals: 1) increase clinical understanding of ADHD and asthma diagnosis and treatment; 2) gain a nuanced understanding of best methods for, and practical experience in, the biological and statistical integration of genetic and metabolomic data; 3) develop skills in machine learning and integrative network methods for multiomic analysis; 4) strengthen current areas of experience to stay on the cutting edge of new analytic and study design techniques; and 5) enhance skills in mentorship, teaching, and the responsible conduct and communication of research. The support of a diverse mentoring team comprised of world experts in the fields of asthma and psychiatric genetics, metabolomics, integrative omics, and statistics, along with her strong quantitative training and the vibrant intellectual community of Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, ensure the success of this proposal. Finally, this research will use state-of-the-art multiomic techniques to lay the initial groundwork for understanding the pathobiology of asthma and ADHD comorbidity, a major and well-established public health concern, from which new research programs will emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although a rich epidemiological literature has demonstrated a high comorbidity between asthma, the most common respiratory disease worldwide, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common behavioral disorder among children, with reports of significant increases in diagnoses in recent years, no studies have interrogated the potential molecular pathobiology underlying the mutual excess risk between asthma and ADHD. This proposal aims to use integrative techniques by combining genetic and metabolomic data to characterize common and distinct mechanisms and pathways of dysregulated metabolism in the presence of comorbid asthma and ADHD and to develop multiomic profiles which can assist in predicting higher risk of ADHD among asthmatic children. The findings from this study will be instrumental in understanding the molecular underpinnings of two highly prevalent public health concerns, and this study will be the first of its kind to interrogate the molecular intersections between asthma and ADHD.",Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity,10041169,K01HL153941,"['Achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Communication Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Formulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sphingolipids', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tryptophan', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Woman', 'antenatal', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'biological systems', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'method development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychogenetics', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2020,178200,0.08462169988684526
"Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework Project Summary / Abstract Exposure to air pollution is an established risk factor for asthma, reduced lung function as well as inflammatory and oxidative processes which are in turn linked with obesity and diabetes. Risk for these adverse outcomes begins early in childhood and well-documented racial/ethnic differences and social disparities render minority children especially vulnerable, yet these populations are underrepresented in the literature. Analysis for truly representative effect estimates should consider a wide array of genetic, social and environmental factors, biologic pathways from exposure to disease, with consideration for causal mediators and interactions. Mediation and interaction analysis can also aid in determining the transportability of estimated effects from one population to another. However, estimation and interpretability of target parameters in mediation analysis is complicated by issues such as mediator-outcome interactions, non-linearities, and exposure-induced confounding, which cannot be addressed using traditional regression approaches. My long-term career goals are to assess optimal interventions on environmental health risk factors that best reduce overall risk in populations of interest. I will utilize advanced epidemiologic methods maximinzing internal validity and efficiency of estimation of target. I will expand on existing methods for estimation of effects in the presence of time varying exposures and covariates as well as exposure-induced mediator outcome confounding (estimation of controlled direct effects and the randomized intervention analogues for the natural direct and indirect effects) which cannot be addressed with traditional regression approaches. The proposed methodology will be suitable for assessment of potential interventions on continuous exposures, which will be especially beneficial in the area of environmental epidemiology. In Aims 1 & 2 of this proposal I will use these proposed methods to assess direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution exposures on risk of asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome, within a counterfactual framework. I am well suited to perform the proposed research based on 1) my past experience in environmental health and advanced methods and counterfactual approaches 2) the exceprional interdisciplinary mentoring team I have assembled and 3) the unique research opportunity offered by the datasets in the proposal, comprised largely of minority children. This proposed study will enable me to quantify mediated effects of air pollution exposures in especially vulnerable populations. I will be advised by a world-class team of mentors to expand my expertise in integrating advanced epidemiologic methods with causal inference applications (e.g., machine learning and efficient estimators of causal inference parameters) in environmental epidemiological studies; epigenetic and exposomic factors as potential modifiers or mediators of effect; and health disparities and social factors associated with environmental exposures. The proposed research and training will enable me to establish an independent career as a leader in intervention assessment and causal inference in environmental epidemiology. Project Narrative There are multiple pathophysiologic pathways through which air pollution exposures exert their effects on health, while racial/ethnic differences exist in terms of prevalence of health outcomes and genetic and social factors linked to levels of exposure and that potentially modify exposure effects. Mediation and interaction analyses are important to help as answer questions about how exposures exert their effects and who may be particularly susceptible, but limitations exist in estimation and interpretability. I propose mediation analysis in a counterfactual framework using data adaptive estimators to address complex epidemiologic issues and quantify direct, indirect and total effects of air pollution health effects on asthma, overall lung function and metabolic syndrome parameters in especially vulnerable minority children populations.",Air pollution exposures and children's health:  mediation and interaction in a counterfactual framework,9894798,R00ES027511,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'African American', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Area', 'Aromatic Polycyclic Hydrocarbons', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'European', 'Exposure to', 'FOXP3 gene', 'Future', 'GALA', 'Genetic', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune system', 'Impairment', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'adverse outcome', 'analog', 'base', 'career', 'cytokine', 'disorder risk', 'early life exposure', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic difference', 'experience', 'exposure pathway', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'minority children', 'pollutant', 'public health intervention', 'pulmonary function', 'racial and ethnic', 'social', 'social disparities', 'social epidemiology', 'social factors', 'social vulnerability', 'tool']",NIEHS,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R00,2020,249000,0.0909709504874816
"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in pediatric obese asthma.",Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility.,9838149,K08AI135091,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allergens', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Response', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interleukin-13', 'Knockout Mice', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'PD-1 pathway', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Activation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Th2 Cells', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Weights and Measures', 'Work', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'antiviral immunity', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'dimensional analysis', 'drinking water', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pediatric patients', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational approach']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K08,2020,186948,0.03859182902163354
"A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage ABSTRACT Infertility and spontaneous abortion (SAB) are significant public health problems, affecting up to 25% of reproductive age couples in the United States. Health care costs attributable to infertility and SAB exceed $5 billion per year, and several studies have shown an association between infertility treatments and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors for subfertility and SAB is an important public health goal. The potential effects of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on risk of subfertility and SAB are understudied. The few existing human studies have limitations including small sample size, enrollment after conception, retrospective study design, suboptimal assessment of exposure and outcome, inadequate control for potential confounding variables, and limited generalizability. The proposed study will prospectively assess the relation of exposure to selected EDCs, including phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), to risk of subfertility and SAB in a preconception subcohort of 950 pregnancy planners. We will use data from two NICHD-supported prospective cohorts of pregnancy planners in North America and Denmark. With web-based recruitment and data collection, we have enrolled over 17,000 women attempting pregnancy into these cohorts. In a subset of 200 participants, we have successfully pilot tested in-person collection of urine and blood specimens during the preconception and early pregnancy periods. In this application, we propose to expand in-person biospecimen collection, increasing the number of women with preconception and early pregnancy urine and blood samples from 200 to 950. At each of our three biospecimen collection sites (Boston, Detroit, and Aarhus), we will enroll 250 women and collect three urine samples and one blood sample (in preconception) and three urine samples and one blood sample (in early pregnancy). We will ship the samples to the CDC for the analysis of urinary phthalates, urinary phenols, and serum PFAS. To increase cost efficiency, we will pool three urine samples in each exposure window before assaying for phthalates and phenols; and we will assay one preconception blood specimen for PFAS, a persistent chemical, in analyses of subfertility and SAB. Finally, we will conduct a pilot study among 100 U.S. participants to assess the feasibility of collecting urine by mail, which would allow us to take advantage of our full geographically-diverse cohort in the future. Strengths of this application include the prospective design, preconception enrollment of pregnancy planners, repeated measurement of exposure during preconception and early pregnancy, excellent control for confounding via bimonthly prospective data collection on a wide range of covariates, and use of the latest analytic methods for mixtures modeling. We have generated compelling preliminary data to support our aims. The present grant is cost-effective in leveraging already-established cohort studies with data collection and follow-up supported by other grants. The results generated will be translatable by directly informing future regulatory decisions about EDC standards in a manner that could reduce rates of infertility and SAB. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nearly 15% of all couples have difficulty becoming pregnant and up to 25% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage. Infertility and miscarriage can cause profound psychological and financial hardship for those affected, and they account for more than 5 billion dollars in U.S. health care costs each year. Identifying modifiable risk factors for infertility and miscarriage, including environmental pollutants (phenols, phthalates, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances), is an important public health goal.","A preconception cohort study of environmental chemicals, fertility, and miscarriage",9840475,R01ES029951,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Benzophenones', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Boston', 'Canada', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Conceptions', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Cost efficiency', 'Couples', 'Cyclohexanes', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Denmark', 'Dicarboxylic Acids', 'Diethylhexyl Phthalate', 'Endocrine Disruptors', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Esters', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Fertility', 'Financial Hardship', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Infertility', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratory Study', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'North America', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parabens', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phenols', 'Pilot Projects', 'Poly-fluoroalkyl substances', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Probability', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Selection Bias', 'Serum', 'Ships', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Spontaneous abortion', 'Sum', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bisphenol A', 'chemical standard', 'child bearing', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'cost estimate', 'design', 'early pregnancy', 'early pregnancy loss', 'environmental chemical', 'follow-up', 'health goals', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infertility treatment', 'innovation', 'male', 'modifiable risk', 'phthalates', 'pregnant', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'subfertility', 'time-to-pregnancy', 'trying to conceive', 'urinary']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,602673,0.015941845372524997
"Identify, Analyze, and Evaluate Potential Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) - 2018 ABSTRACT ALS is a devastating and fatal neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure or effective treatment. The causes of ALS likely involve interaction of environmental and genetic susceptibility factors. Exposure to the damaging environmental stressors likely occurs at particularly susceptible time-periods, and for a prolonged period. We will investigate the époques during which environmental exposures carry the greatest risk for later development of ALS. We will use questionnaire data, residential history, and DNA samples from our on-going epidemiologic studies in Northern New England and Ohio, the existing environmental and genetic variant data from the National ALS Registry for ALS patients nationwide, and both clinic- and random population-based controls. We will use geospatial algorithms to estimate residential exposures in years extending backwards for ~30 years derived from our databases of time-linked contents of sources of environmental toxins (cyanobacteria) and toxicants (landfills, municipal incinerators, Superfund and Brownfield sites, pesticide applications). We also propose to identify genetic risk factors for ALS that manifest effects specifically in the presence of an environmental stressor. We will use the existing Illumina NeuroChip data covering 500,000 genetic variants implicated in neurodegenerative illness on the National ALS Biorepository participants, and propose to assay our epidemiologic study DNA samples on the same panel to construct a large, pooled genotype dataset. Genetic imputation will allow genome-wide coverage for identification of novel variants. We will employ the machine- learning methods to identify gene x environment interactions, the genetic variants that synergize with environmental stressors to increase disease risk. This project has the potential to identify the environmental and genetic risk factors in periods of temporal susceptibility that will lead to disease prevention through exposure mitigation, early-identification, and development of interventions to block disease progression. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH The prevention and cure of ALS require identification of susceptibility genes and the most important environmental risk factors, their most sensitive period of exposure, and the implementation of steps to mitigate these exposures. We propose to use residential history to estimate exposures to waterbody cyanobacteria, pesticides, and polluted sites in ALS patients compared to healthy controls using time-linked databases. We expect these studies to reveal genetic variants that raise ALS susceptibility, and determine the periods of life that carry the greatest risk for developing ALS from exposures to environmental stressors.","Identify, Analyze, and Evaluate Potential Risk Factors for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) - 2018",9973035,R01TS000288,[' '],ATSDR,DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK CLINIC,R01,2020,500000,0.03903213209790886
"Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies Project Summary Traditionally, environmental epidemiologic studies have focused on assessing risks related to a single pollutant at a time. This, however, does not reflect reality, since we are constantly exposed to multiple pollutants at once. It is very important, therefore, to be able to assess exposure to pollutant mixtures when conducting environmental epidemiologic methods. Doing so, however, is especially challenging, mainly due to the high dimension of the multi-pollutant exposure matrix (if the exposure of interest includes more than e.g. 5 or 10 chemicals) and because these pollutants are usually very highly correlated with each other. Although some methods are available to address these issues, they usually require strong assumptions and have severe limitations. With this study we propose to bypass most of these limitations by adapting and extending a novel and robust method to assess exposure to multiple pollutants, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP). We will assess the performance of PCP synthetic datasets representing multiple potential scenarios and study designs, and compare our results to those obtained by existing methods. Subsequently, we will apply PCP to three important Public Health issues, i.e. to evaluate the associations between (i) in utero exposure to a mixture of PCBs and neurodevelopment, (ii) exposure to a metals mixture and cardiovascular health, and (iii) exposure to an air pollution mixture and emergency cardiovascular admissions. Finally, we will develop and share software so other researchers can freely use this novel, robust and flexible tool across a plethora of study designs and research questions. Our proposed work will be significant as it will provide epidemiologists with a novel and robust tool to assess exposure to environmental pollutant mixtures. Project Narrative We are constantly exposed to a mixture of environmental pollutants at once, but current epidemiologic methods either assess each pollutant separately, not capturing reality, or have severe limitations. With this study we propose to adapt a wildly popular method used in computer vision applications, called Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), and develop flexible extensions for many epidemiologic settings. We propose to assess the performance of this method, compare with existing methods and employ in real-life applications, as well as develop and share software so other research can also use this novel, robust and flexible tool.",Principal Component Pursuit to Assess Exposure to Environmental Mixtures in Epidemiologic Studies,9843133,R01ES028805,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Air Pollutants', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Educational workshop', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Pollutants', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Joints', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Poison', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Work', 'cardiovascular emergency', 'cardiovascular health', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'pollutant', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIEHS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,569866,0.0812461945194097
"Physical, Social, and Economic Environments and Firearm Fatalities among Youth Project Summary / Abstract (30 lines) As a social epidemiologist and junior faculty member at UC Davis, my career goal is to build a program of research that identifies fundamental causes of violence and its determinants, and to use this understanding to test effective approaches to reduce violence-related harm. The relationship between neighborhood-level characteristics and firearm violence is well recognized. However, these multiple exposures likely operate in complex and reciprocal ways with each other and with crime and violence that are not yet well understood. Therefore, I propose to take advantage of an existing dataset built for an ongoing study of demolition and rehabilitation of decaying properties in Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan, for which I am the principal investigator, to describe the range of neighborhood-level exposures in each of these cities and to identify how these exposures work together to impact firearm violence. These objectives will be accomplished through three specific aims: Aim 1: To describe variation in classes of neighborhood interventions across neighborhoods and neighborhood characteristics in Cleveland, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan from 2010 through 2019; Aim 2: to identify the neighborhood-level exposures that are most predictive of high levels of neighborhood youth firearm violence; and Aim 3: to estimate effects of individual neighborhood interventions and classes of neighborhood interventions on rates of neighborhood violent crime, firearm-related crime, firearm homicides, and firearm suicides among youth and young adults age 10 to 29. I will use detailed datasets primarily built from parcel- level administrative data in each city in order to accomplish the aims of the proposed study. These datasets use micro-data to describe neighborhood characteristics such as home quality, foreclosure rates, land use type, and vacancies. These micro-data are coupled with census variables on demographics, education levels, and other socioeconomic indicators and are aggregated to census tracts. We also undertook a thorough and systematic review of programs and policies hypothesized to influence violence prevention, either directly (e.g. changes in policing strategies) or indirectly (e.g. incentives to encourage buying homes in specific neighborhoods) and critical events, defined as expected and unexpected shocks to the cities, over the study period (2010-2019). These interventions and events are mapped to specific locations and dates. I will use a range of rigorous statistical methods, including latent class analysis, ensemble machine learning and causal inference methods, and spatial analysis methods to accomplish the study aims. I have identified three critical areas where continued training will prepare me to pursue my career goals and make important contributions to the field of violence prevention. These include training in 1) spatial analysis, 2) criminology and criminal justice theory, and 3) the analysis of multiple, correlated exposures. The experience gained through the proposed program of study will help me develop the skills, understanding, and experience I need to succeed in my career goals and allow me to answer critical questions on neighborhood exposures and youth firearm violence. Project Narrative (3 sentences) While the relationship between neighborhood-level characteristics and firearm violence is well recognized, very little is known about the relative importance and joint effects of the multiple and dynamic exposures that make up the neighborhood environment. Describing the range of exposures and their relative importance in predicting youth firearm violence, as well as the independent and joint effects of these exposures on firearm violence is critical for developing a deeper understanding of how “place” affects violence. Investigation of the environmental causes of firearm violence may illuminate broad-based interventions with a greater ability to achieve widespread and lasting impacts.","Physical, Social, and Economic Environments and Firearm Fatalities among Youth",10136967,K01CE003224,[' '],NCIPC,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,K01,2020,124066,0.015151321714577327
"Identification of Early Metabolomic and Immune Endotypes of Allergy and Asthma: An Integrated Multiomics Approach PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolic dysregulation due to in utero and early-life environmental exposures has lasting consequences on the developing immune system and lung and that these changes underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the dysregulated metabolic-immune pathways and mechanisms involved in early childhood atopy and wheeze. Our preliminary study of the infant untargeted metabolome demonstrated that dysregulation in the unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and lipid mediator's pathway are associated with number of wheeze episodes in a dose-response manner, which suggests the involvement of endogenous antioxidant and lipid mediator pathways. In another preliminary study of the infant immunome, we demonstrated that two distinct infant immune response profiles to acute respiratory infection, with an immune response pattern characterized by increased Type-2 and Type-17 and decreased non-interferon Type- 1 immune responses to with increased risk of recurrent wheeze. While these single omics studies can identify dysregulated metabolites and immune-responses in wheeze phenotypes, they alone fail to capture the full spectrum of underlying pathobiology. The integration of omics data has advanced the understanding of other chronic disease pathogenesis, as it is likely to do for childhood atopy and wheeze. Therefore, we hypothesize that the integration of early-life metabolome (including lipidome) and immunome can elucidate molecular pathways relevant to atopy and wheeze development. To test this hypothesis, the candidate will capitalize on existing carefully phenotyped population-based birth cohort of healthy infants (INSPIRE) and a replication cohort from the NIH ECHO initiative (ECHO-CREW asthma consortium) and accomplish the following specific aims: 1) To investigate whether increased unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels reduce early life atopy and wheeze incidence by enhancing the bioavailability of pro-resolving lipid mediators and antioxidants and decreasing pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, 2) To discover novel immunome profiles and network modules that characterize atopy and wheeze phenotypes, and 3) To uncover novel metabolic-immune molecular pathways associated with the development of atopy and wheeze phenotypes by integrating metabolome and immunome data. Successful completion of these aims will: (1) provide novel insights into the role of the early- life metabolome and immunome in the pathogenesis of atopy and wheeze and (2) identify targets for disease prevention. The proposal builds on the candidate's previous work, expertise, and interest in systems approaches to understand disease development. The goal of this career development proposal is for the candidate to emerge as an independent investigator in the field of asthma and allergy with unique knowledge and application of systems approaches to understand disease mechanisms. The candidate is in an outstanding academic environment, has a well thought out training and research plan, which will propel him into an independent expert in the field of immuno-metabolism of atopy and asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early life metabolic dysregulation has lasting consequences on the developing infant immune system and lung, and these changes likely underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze (an early manifestation of allergy and asthma). Knowledge gaps remain in understanding the pathobiological mechanisms of atopy and wheeze phenotypes, which the proposed study aims to address by computationally integrating metabolome and immune response data to identify molecular pathways relevant to the pathobiology of atopic and wheeze phenotypes.

"Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity PROJECT SUMMARY  Wildfire occurrence, duration, and intensity have heightened in recent decades and continue to impact the health of millions of individuals worldwide. Smoke that is emitted from wildfires consists of a complex mixture of particulate matter and toxic gases. The chemical composition of wildfire smoke is dependent upon the type of biomass burn conditions and fuel type, which are heavily influenced by geographical region. The chemical mixtures within wildfire smoke that humans are exposed to can consequently cause variable health outcomes through potentially different biological mechanisms. Human exposure to wildfire smoke represents a growing concern in public health, and adequately characterizing health risks associated with biomass smoke across varying burn conditions and geographic areas is not possible with the data currently available.  The variabilities in toxicological responses across wildfire smoke exposure conditions have yet to be fully established and evaluated in the context of chemical composition. The growing threat of wildfires necessitates the elucidation of individual and/or co-occurring components of wildfire smoke that act as the primary drivers of toxicity. To address this important research issue, we expand upon a foundational study that has previously characterized the chemical constituents in various biomass burn scenarios and evaluated, in part, toxicological responses to these exposures in the mouse lung. Here, we leverage this extensive database and banked samples to: 1. characterize in vivo transcriptomic responses and pathway alterations associated with biomass smoke in the mouse lung; 2. integrate chemical-toxicity profiles using computational approaches to prioritize chemicals that are likely driving toxicity responses; and 3. further evaluate chemical drivers of biomass smoke toxicity responses using in vitro approaches.  This research will be carried out through a collaboration with laboratories at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, allowing for a unique combination of expertise for studying the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity. This expertise includes skills in computational toxicology, exposure science, and molecular biology, coupled with experience studying adverse health effects and immune responses induced by exposure to air pollutants. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exposure to wildfire smoke continues to be a growing threat to public health, yet the primary drivers of toxicity and disease are not completely understood. This proposal represents an innovative approach to increase understanding on the health effects of wildfires by leveraging a robust dataset of chemical-biological profiles from mice exposed to biomass smoke condensate samples derived from variable conditions. New data will also be generated alongside additional in vitro testing to more comprehensively examine mechanisms of toxicity and identify the primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity, resulting in improved abilities to predict region- specific health risks attributable to wildfires.",Integrative chemical-biological profiling to determine primary drivers of wildfire smoke-induced toxicity,9956440,R21ES031740,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollutants', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomass', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemically Induced Toxicity', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Coupled', 'Critical Pathways', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gases', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Inhalation Exposure', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mus', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicogenomics', 'Toxicology', 'United States Environmental Protection Agency', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Wildfire', 'asthma exacerbation', 'base', 'biomass fuel', 'biomass smoke', 'computational toxicology', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'data warehouse', 'experience', 'exposed human population', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'male', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoke inhalation', 'toxicant', 'transcriptomics']",NIEHS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,227277,0.029246099867078084
"Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents Asthma self‐management is essential for preventing exacerbations and reducing the burden of the disease. However, poor adherence to prescribed treatment and poor recognition of symptoms leads to reduced asthma control, particularly among adolescents. Studies show that adolescents lack understanding about self‐management, and that asthma education during clinic visits is deficient, resulting in insufficient asthma management. Mobile technology, specifically, mobile applications (or apps) are an efficient way to increase patient‐provider communication, provide feedback on asthma management, and deliver asthma education. Our pilot work has demonstrated that an app can be effective at improving asthma control in adolescents aged 12‐17, and that adolescents are enthusiastic about utilizing mHealth technologies for asthma management, but that existing apps are not engaging or appealing enough to an adolescent population to sustain long‐term use. For this pilot study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self‐management in order to obtain data necessary to complete a future large efficacy trial of the app in adolescents with persistent asthma. The objective of this project is to use an agile, iterative, user‐centered design process to tailor our existing proof of concept app to adolescent user preferences and to use a mixed‐ methods approach to test feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy. The long‐term goal is to identify mHealth technological approaches that facilitate self‐management of chronic diseases, particularly among adolescents, and to develop marketing strategies to promote long‐term support of these approaches. The rationale for this project is that adolescents are quick to adopt mobile technologies, have a high degree of smartphone use, and are at a point of transition from parental management of their chronic condition to self‐ management, making this a priority population for the development of interventions targeting asthma control. For this project, we have two specific aims: 1) To refine an asthma self‐management app for adolescents with persistent asthma; and 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to the app in a small randomized controlled trial. The approach is innovative because we are incorporating a user‐centered design process to integrate multiple components for facilitating asthma self‐management in a mHealth tool tailored for adolescents within the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Despite studies showing that mHealth tools can be effective, few have prioritized an adolescent audience or evaluated the tool compared to standard of care using rigorous, mixed‐method approaches. This research is significant because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the US and the prevalence of the condition continues to rise, and so innovative tools to improve self‐management of the disease are critically needed. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, which makes the proposed research a significant public health burden. This pilot is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self-management among adolescents with persistent asthma. Knowledge gained from this pilot study will be used to design and conduct a future efficacy trial of the app. This project addresses the mission of NHLBI by developing a novel intervention to treat asthma. This study leverages our formative and pilot work to continue making strides towards enhancing asthma control among adolescents with persistent asthma in order to reduce asthma-related morbidity.",Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents,9824678,R34HL145442,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Information System', 'Hispanics', 'Incentives', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Self Management', 'Smoking', 'Social Change', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'age group', 'aged', 'arm', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient-clinician communication', 'peak flow measurement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R34,2020,181719,0.08638031861569041
"Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Many epidemiological investigations have associated exposure to traffic-derived air pollution from motor vehicles, air toxins from industry, and other environmental toxins with measures of poor birth outcomes consisting of preeclampsia (PE), preterm birth (PTB) and intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR). These conditions, which collectively constitute ischemic placental disease, correlate strongly with infant morbidity and a host of adult diseases, ranging from coronary artery disease to cancer. Although it is widely believed that the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to complications of ischemic placental disease and placental insufficiency have similar biological origins, starting as early as defective placental implantation, to date there are no predictive studies that prospectively examine placental function. Thus, non-invasive assessment and prediction of normalcy versus aberrancy of placental function are lacking. Therefore, the overarching objective of this proposal is to develop and evaluate a suite of exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures (predictor) for predicting placental insufficiency. Moreover, we seek to use these novel signatures to assess the impact of environmental pollution exposure on placental aberrancy/insufficiency and related outcomes (PE, PTB and IUGR) (primary outcome). Our central hypothesis is that chronic exposure to environmental pollution, independent of socio-economic status (SES), increases the risk of placental insufficiency due to early gestational development of adverse placental function, and that these outcomes can be predicted non-invasively by developing maternal blood derived placental-enriched exosomal micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures. To test this hypothesis, our specific aims are to: AIM 1: Develop non-invasively in maternal blood, placenta-derived exosomal micro- transcriptomic and transcriptomic signatures that predict in-vivo placental function through all three trimesters. AIM 2: Use the micro-transcriptomic and transcriptomic data from Aim 1 to predict environmental pollution data collected during the course of this study. We will construct models to predict the environmental pollution state based on these signatures, so that they may be used as proxy of the pollution when this data is not available. AIM 3: Perform Epigenome Wide Association Studies using DNA methylation from placental tissues of the same cohort. We will use our Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing to identify loci whose methylation is associated with placental insufficiency and environmental exposures. These studies will help identify genes confirmed by transcriptomic analysis that may be useful in future development of therapeutic interventions for women at high risk of placental insufficiency due to air pollution exposures. Identification of molecular signatures that predict the presence of environmental pollution and adverse pregnancy outcomes may become a game-changer. Obstetric practices may embrace these surveillance tactics in real-time to predict and perhaps reverse placental aberrancy/insufficiency. PROJECT NARRATIVE How environmental pollution contributes to poor pregnancy outcome is poorly understood, and the first trimester of pregnancy is a particularly vulnerable time period for the developing fetus, thus a mother's exposure to air pollution may alter the way that the placenta is established and how it functions throughout the rest of pregnancy. This project aims to identify new molecular markers reflecting normal and abnormal placental function that can be detected non-invasively in a pregnant woman's blood, towards assessing real- time placental function as pregnancy develops from the first to the third trimester. Thus, early detection, prevention strategies, and timely treatment of placental dysfunction as a result of environmental pollution exposures may be developed.",Biomarkers and Genes Associated with Placental Development and Function in Response to Environmental Pollution,9942495,R01HD089714,"['Adult', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Impact', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'High Risk Woman', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mothers', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Normalcy', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Placenta', 'Placenta Diseases', 'Placental Insufficiency', 'Placentation', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Validation', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenome-wide association studies', 'exosome', 'imaging study', 'implantation', 'in vivo', 'infant morbidity', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive signature', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapeutic development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,173441,0.06825132283150166
"Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this RC2 proposal is to generate the first, multi-omics translational study capturing the sum of environmental exposures (i.e. the exposome) and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without effective medical therapy. PSC shortens survival, is associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and strongly predisposes to cholangiocarcinoma (i.e. bile duct cancer) and colon cancer. Our recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) revealed the significant role of genetic variation in PSC, while also re-emphasizing the importance of environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in PSC pathogenesis. To further elucidate the role of exposures from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, toxins, drugs, microbes), we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team that synergizes expertise and resources across four institutions: Mayo Clinic, Emory University, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), and University of Oslo, Norway. Our collaborative team will leverage large clinical databases and biorepositories, as well as expertise in PSC and related conditions, exposomics, metabolomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, genomics, and data analytics to develop the PSC Scientific Community Resource for hypothesis-generating science and simultaneously uncover factors contributing to PSC.  We now seek to define the bigger-picture cellular networks, rather than individual genes, driving disease processes. To do so, we will use unbiased network-based approaches designed to integrate multiple layers of omics data. Our proposal is predicated on the hypothesis that multi-omics analyses of data capturing environmental exposures and the associated biological responses, including the effect on the genome, will reveal networks or pathways influencing PSC pathogenesis and outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a series of sophisticated analyses to identify PSC-associated changes in and across the exposome, metabolome, methylome, and transcriptome in blood as well as the gut metagenome, exposome and metabolome.  Our collaboration and data generation are already underway with pilot studies demonstrating differences in blood exposomes and metabolomes and stool metagenomes between PSC patients and controls. Using a suite of bioinformatic tools and available genetic variation data, we aim to discover stable, detectable, omics-based disease signatures in blood (Aim 1) and stool (Aim 2) that when integrated with clinical data (Aim 3) will reveal biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis and outcomes. All data, residual specimens, and analytical details will be made freely available to the research community in accordance with NIDDK's mission. Furthermore, this effort responds to the NIDDK's call “to better understand the role of the microbiome, genetics, and exposome.” PROJECT NARRATIVE We seek to generate the first, multi-omics translational study and comprehensive data resource for Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC), a chronic, progressive liver disease without medical therapy. We will define the bigger-picture cellular networks and gene-environment interactions driving PSC by integrating multiple layers of -omics data. In so doing, we will identify molecular disease signatures, including environmental toxins, metabolism-related chemicals and gut bacteria, unique to PSC patients.",Dissecting the pathogenesis and outcomes of PSC using multi-omics by studying the exposome and genome,9986790,RC2DK118619,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bile duct carcinoma', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Chemical Exposure', 'Chemicals', 'Childhood', 'Cholangiocarcinoma', 'Cholestasis', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Feces', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'High Performance Computing', 'Illinois', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institution', 'Life Style', 'Light', 'Link', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Disease', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Network-based', 'Norway', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Shotguns', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Sum', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Toxin', 'Universities', 'base', 'biobank', 'bioinformatics tool', 'clinical database', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'gut bacteria', 'gut metagenome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'innovation', 'liver transplantation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'methylation pattern', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'patient population', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'pollutant', 'primary outcome', 'primary sclerosing cholangitis', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,RC2,2020,1547338,0.05113384082374951
