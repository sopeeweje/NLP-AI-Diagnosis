"Identifying Children and Teens at Risk for Early Onset Alcohol Use: An Innovative Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Early onset of alcohol use during adolescence is associated with increased probability of later alcohol dependence, polydrug abuse, victimization, conduct problems, psychiatric comorbidities, and delayed achievement of adult milestones. Methods that yield rapid, accurate, and reliable predictions of which children and teens are at risk for early onset can improve the targeting of prevention interventions and enable the concentration of resources on the most debilitating and costly cases. One promising and untapped approach to this prediction problem is machine learning (also called “statistical learning,” “data mining,” or “predictive modeling”), a class of techniques arising from statistics, computer science, and engineering that seeks to build data-driven predictive algorithms. These techniques are most noticeably distinguished from “traditional” statistical methods (e.g., ordinary least squares regression) by their extreme emphasis on prediction of future cases, rather than explanation of the current data, and thus they may offer dramatic advantages over traditional approaches to identifying which children and teens will develop early onset alcohol use. This proposal will explore the potential contribution of machine learning methods by directly comparing their predictive performance to that of the traditional approach in a large-scale, multisite longitudinal study of the development of early onset alcohol use (N = 731). If machine learning methods do significantly outperform the traditional approach, future directions might include the development and implementation of machine-learning- based screening methods for real-world use. On the other hand, if machine learning methods do not outperform the traditional approach, this will suggest that at least in the context of the present study (i.e., these predictors, timeline, and outcome), machine learning does not improve the prediction of early onset alcohol use. Analyses will investigate whether the performance of machine learning methods varies across the nature of predictor variables use, the age span covered, and the outcome to be predicted. Thus, the current proposal uses an extant longitudinal dataset to carry out two specific aims: (1) Train five different machine learning algorithms and one traditional algorithm (ordinary logistic regression) for predicting later early onset alcohol use in a subset (70%) of the data. (2) Test these six predictive algorithms on the rest (30%) of the data and directly compare their predictive performance in multiple contexts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prospectively predicting which children and teens are at risk for early onset alcohol use enables targeted implementation of preventive interventions. Machine learning is a promising yet untapped approach that may be well-suited to this task. This study investigates the potential of several machine learning algorithms to contribute to the rapid, accurate, and reliable identification of individuals at risk for early onset alcohol use.",Identifying Children and Teens at Risk for Early Onset Alcohol Use: An Innovative Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Prevention,9753696,F31AA026768,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advertising', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Fraud', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Lasso', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol screening', 'base', 'classification trees', 'computer science', 'conduct problem', 'cost', 'data mining', 'early alcohol use', 'early onset', 'field study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidrug abuse', 'outcome prediction', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'screening', 'search engine', 'spam', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success', 'underage drinking', 'vector']",NIAAA,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2019,43749,0.09417297013999525
"Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning Project Summary Development of general and efficient methods for functionalization of alcohols is highly warranted due to the ubiquity and prominence of this functional group in natural products. Such methods would allow for late-stage diversification of complex molecules and, consequently, could have a broad impact in natural product synthesis and preparation of relevant pharmaceutical materials. However, owing to the chemical inertness of alcohols, most methods typically require installation of activating groups for functionalization, making them unattractive from an atom- and step-economical perspective. Nonetheless, many advances have been made. In particular, the Barton-McCombie reaction has become an indispensable tool for reductive functionalization of alcohols. Unfortunately, this transformation requires pre- functionalization of the alcohol substrate, employs highly toxic tin reagents, and invokes the use high reaction temperatures or harmful UV light for initiation of radical intermediates. Furthermore, the overall transformation is limited to H-atom incorporation or reductive coupling with alkenes. Lastly, only a few deoxygenation methods exist that are amenable for late-stage and site-selective deoxygenation in complex systems. Moreover, physical organic chemistry tools available to facilitate the selection of a set of conditions or parameters to afford site-selectivity are limited. In this proposal, we will develop a mild and practical photocatalytic deoxygenation of alcohols. Our strategy will focus on solving the inherent limitation of the Barton McCombie reaction by 1) avoiding the use of toxic tin reagents, 2) obviating the need for pre-functionalization of the alcohol substrate, and 3) allowing for modular coupling of formed alkyl radicals via Ni-catalysis. Specific aim 1 explores the development of a novel photoredox-catalyzed deoxygenation of alcohols. In addition, we outline a general protocol for deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols via inception of the alkyl radical intermediate, formed via β-scission, with various radical electrophiles. Moreover, we highlight an innovative method for the direct cross-coupling of alcohols via metallophotoredox catalysis in both racemic and enantioselective fashion. Specific aim 2 addresses the design strategy for implementing physical chemistry techniques such as Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space. Also, we outline applying this strategy to identify a set of optimal conditions to confer site-selective functionalization in complex polyols. Project Narrative Mild and site-controlled deoxygenation of alcohols could significantly accelerate the late-stage synthesis/diversification of important organic molecules; however, current methods often employ toxic tin reagents, harsh reaction conditions, and require prefunctionalization of the alcohols employed. The strategy proposed would allow for a mild photocatalytic deoxygenation, as well as deoxyfunctionalization, of alcohols that solves the aforementioned limitations of prior art. Moreover, the proposed strategy outlines implementation of physical organic chemistry tools Machine Learning in order to facilitate optimization and prediction of reaction performance in multi-dimensional chemical space.",Development of a novel photocatalytic system for direct deoxyfunctionalization of alcohols involving machine learning,9759306,F32GM129910,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Alkenes', 'Arts', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Development', 'Employment', 'Intercept', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Natural Products', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Organic Synthesis', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phosphines', 'Physical Chemistry', 'Preparation', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Tin', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Visible Radiation', 'alcohol involvement', 'catalyst', 'design', 'functional group', 'innovation', 'novel', 'polyol', 'predictive tools', 'tool']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,F32,2019,61226,0.05613543680214717
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9761396,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical implementation', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,587565,0.15080623718502606
"Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media Consumption of cancer causing products (CCPs) is the root cause of many of the cancers and chronic diseases we aim to cure with translational medicine. Tobacco and alcohol consumption is a function of highly successful, coordinated global business models that promote consumption. The marketing of CCPs can be seen as a disease vector that drives CCP consumption and worthy of surveillance. The present project addresses the marketing of tobacco and alcohol to young people in the current media environment, in which youths increasingly stream their entertainment in a relatively commercial free environment. To address decreasing reach of traditional advertising, companies have sought to embed their brands in the entertainment itself. Alcohol companies actively seek entertainment placement deals. While cigarette companies have agreed not to pay for product placement, they may evade current restrictions by burying placements in the massive streamed entertainment environment. E-cigarette companies have no such restrictions and advertise on television. Youths obtain exposure to brands that spend more on advertising (e.g., Budweiser); these are also the most commonly consumed brands by youth. Product placement exposures may put adolescents at greater risk for CCP consumption. This study represents the first step in assessing that risk--to obtain infoveillance on CCP brand prevalence in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 involves a partnership with machine learning researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop and validate a computer recognition system for major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brands in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 relies on an existing, large Dartmouth media training library that includes detailed timing for tobacco and alcohol brands from over 2000 contemporary movies. JPL researchers will use the Dartmouth media library, combined with a large corpus of brand logos retrieved from the web, to train and validate an automated Video Content Coding (VCC) system that identifies content associated with key alcohol and tobacco brands. The VCC system will leverage recent techniques to construct robust object detection systems using Convolutional Neural Networks built on large image databases, along with text extraction methods to identify brand names in advertising logos. Second, we will deploy the automated recognition system on the Dartmouth computer cluster to assess the frequency of major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brand placements from a large sample of streamed/cable and movie entertainment. This proposal involves a unique multidisciplinary team of Dartmouth behavioral scientists and NASA machine learning scientists who will leverage new technologies to study a significant CCP marketing platform. The novel approach offers unprecedented opportunities to conduct surveillance on CCP marketing in large media samples. Our project will set the stage for future research on exposure to this type of marketing and its relation to CCP consumption in youths and lead to a better understanding of the risks CCP brand placements pose to health. Project Narrative This project addresses the potential exposure of youth to marketing of cancer causing products— tobacco and alcohol— in the popular commercial-free streaming environment, where products are embedded in the media itself through product placement. We will employ machine learning to develop an automated visual recognition system for major tobacco and alcohol brands and deploy that system to evaluate brand placement in a large sample of streamed entertainment from cable (e.g., HBO) and other (e.g., Netflix Originals) companies. This surveillance program will have the capability to monitor embedded marketing across many platforms and ultimately allow us to assess youth exposure to embedded brands and its relation with early onset of tobacco and alcohol use.",Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media,9656103,R01CA225845,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Alcohols', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Influenza', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Stream', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Surveillance', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'computer cluster', 'computerized', 'convolutional neural network', 'drinking', 'early onset', 'handheld mobile device', 'innovation', 'movie', 'movie exposure', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco exposure', 'tobacco products', 'translational medicine']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2019,531248,0.04330586127749458
"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",9734801,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,422197,0.05744612025356995
"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,9675194,R01AA026368,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Biosensor', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Concentration measurement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol response', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'data reduction', 'diaries', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'physiologic model', 'population based', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'supervised learning', 'time interval', 'time use', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,508222,0.10549107362761181
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9952669,U01DA041089,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brain health', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'design', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'longitudinal analysis', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'modifiable risk', 'multimodality', 'named group', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stimulus processing', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'trend', 'web-based assessment']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2019,119406,0.14837532895816738

All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9697399,U01DA041089,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brain health', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'design', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'longitudinal analysis', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'modifiable risk', 'multimodality', 'named group', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stimulus processing', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'trend', 'web-based assessment']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2019,3323000,0.14837532895816738
"Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development Abstract Alcohol initiation at an early age is associated with numerous negative outcomes, including a significant increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-use disorder later in life. Vulnerability for early misuse and other problematic alcohol use behaviors have been linked to individual differences in brain function. However, few studies have sought to identify brain-based predictors (‘neuromarkers’) of alcohol use behaviors in youth. Identification of brain-based predictors of alcohol use behaviors in youth is essential for the development of more effective early prevention and intervention efforts. This proposal combines machine learning and longitudinal modeling approaches to 1) identify neural networks predictive of early alcohol initiation and misuse and 2) chart the developmental trajectories of these networks over time in a large sample of youth (N>3,000) using data from three unique, proprietary and completed datasets. Neural networks conferring vulnerability for alcohol use behaviors during adolescence will be identified using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). CPM is a machine-learning method of generating behavioral predictions from individual patterns of brain organization; i.e., functional connectivity matrices. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, CPM is entirely data-driven and requires no a priori selection of brain regions or networks. As such, CPM is both a predictive tool and a method of identifying networks that underlie specific behaviors; i.e., neuromarkers. CPM has been successfully used to predict complex behaviors including future abstinence and other addiction-relevant phenotypes. This proposal will use CPM to identify neuromarkers of alcohol initiation and predict transitions to risky drinking in youth (AIM 1). Quantification of changes in brain function, e.g., growth curve trajectory analysis, is central to the characterization of developmental phenomena. Analyses of developmental trajectories can be used to identify particularly sensitive growth periods, detect variations that may signal risk, define modifiable targets, and monitor the impact of environment and interventions on development. While extant data indicate alcohol-related alterations in neural development, very few studies have assessed interactions between neurodevelopmental trajectories over time and alcohol-use behaviors. Developmental trajectories of identified networks in relation to alcohol use behaviors over time will be assessed using multilevel modeling (AIM 2). This proposal represents the first attempt to identify neural networks predictive of alcohol-initiation and risky drinking using a wholly data- driven, machine learning approach in a large sample of youth and does so using existing data. This is a critical step toward identifying a reliable predictor of alcohol initiation in youth and will shed light on individual difference factors representing vulnerability for misuse. Such predictors are needed to understand the developmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes and to inform early risk models and preventative intervention efforts. Project Narrative: Alcohol is the most commonly used substance in youth, and earlier ages of alcohol initiation are associated with increased likelihoods of alcohol-use disorder later in life. This project will identify brain networks that predict alcohol initiation and misuse—and chart the developmental trajectories of those networks over time— using existing neuroimaging data from three unique longitudinal datasets (N>3,000). Identification of brain- based predictors of alcohol initiation and misuse will aid in the development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts to address alcohol problems in youth.",Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development,9713715,R01AA027553,"['Abstinence', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'European', 'Female', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'brain research', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'hazardous drinking', 'high risk', 'high risk drinking', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'theories', 'time use', 'university student', 'young adult']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,463176,0.10656591685813079
"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9625118,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2019,162123,0.05309350253331565
"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively. Drs. Miranda and Barnett will serve as external advisers and support Dr. Roberts's training in ambulatory assessment in the context of medication development research and transdermal alcohol detection, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder is a potentially disabling disease with a large economic and health burden in the United States. This proposal furthers public health interests by providing important training opportunities to an early- career clinical investigator interested in developing medication to treat alcohol use disorder.

"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nation’s health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the world’s largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",9758947,F31DA047048,"['4-aminospiroperidol', 'Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2019,35547,0.09655965157900373
"Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach Alcohol consumption is an etiologic essential for the development of alcohol use disorder and many alcohol pathologies. Despite evidence that genetic variations contribute to alcohol consumption, the genetic architecture remains poorly characterized. In terms of the genetic component, individual susceptibility to complex traits such as alcohol consumption arise mainly from variation in gene regulation. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that alternative polyadenylation (APA) – a mechanism by which a single gene encodes multiple RNA isoforms with different polyadenylation (polyA) sites – is extensively used to modulate gene regulation. An improved understanding of the genetic causes of predisposition to alcohol-related problems will facilitate a precision medicine approach through better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  Yet shortcomings in current methods for concurrent APA identification and RNA transcript quantitation in high-throughput short read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have limited our ability to study its genetic contributions to alcohol-related phenotypes. To remedy this, a novel trans-omics method and related software will be developed here that can precisely identify expressed polyA sites and accurately quantify individual isoforms including APA transcripts from a sequenced RNA-Seq library. Specifically, a supervised machine learning algorithm will be built that utilizes both RNA-Seq data and DNA sequence indicators to predict the locations of expressed polyA sites (Aim 1). The “use-all-data” approach will identify and quantify APA isoforms present in the data with greater precision than current, one-dimensional omics techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm will be designed for integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines for quantitation along with other RNA species (Aim 2).  To determine the influence of APA on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, a systems genetics approach will be applied to relate brain RNA expression of the APA isoforms and other RNA molecules, including protein-coding, long non-coding, and microRNA (miRNA) transcripts, to alcohol consumption measures in a two-bottle choice paradigm (Aim 3). From this approach, if and how APA influences gene networks and susceptibility to miRNA regulation, what genetic factors control APA, and how APA may influence alcohol consumption can be evaluated.  An extensive fellowship training plan and a team of mentors with diverse skillsets will be utilized to accomplish the multidisciplinary research project. The result of this training will be an alcohol researcher with not only the latest bioinformatics and computational skills but also the knowledge and experience to interpret, refine, and improve these models in the context of alcohol research. By following a training plan that incorporates the best of both disciplines, this proposal will be an example of a new type of alcohol researcher that can harness big data in a disease relevant way. Understanding the role of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in alcohol-related phenotypes and pathologies will provide important insights into biological mechanisms related to alcohol for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of alcohol-related problems. The proposed research will study the association of APA with a predisposition for free-choice alcohol consumption using a novel trans-omics computational approach.",Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach,9833879,F31AA027430,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Adopted', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fabry Disease', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Fellowship', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Hypertrophy', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Inbreeding', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metachromatic Leukodystrophy', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Export', 'Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polyadenylation', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rattus', 'Recombinants', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'alcohol prevention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cohort', 'consumption measures', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic architecture', 'improved', 'insight', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'skills', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'user-friendly']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,F31,2019,30732,0.07567582183736384
"Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers ABSTRACT  Binge or heavy episodic drinking has been on the rise and is associated with a range of harmful consequences that scale up with the high intensity drinking prevalent among young adults. Evidence on the nature and extent of neural changes associated with binge drinking (BD) is scant, especially as regards sex differences, so more sensitive, high-precision imaging modalities are needed to examine persistent brain alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods are sensitive to brain function, as well as different neural tissue properties, and are well suited to provide multidimensional insight into the structure and organization of the brain. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies in BD, evidence obtained from individuals with alcohol use disorder suggests that degradation of prefrontal functions may contribute to impaired executive functions and an inability to refrain from hazardous drinking. Consistent with findings in alcohol use disorder, our data and other evidence indicate that BD participants show compensatory engagement of additional brain areas to maintain adequate performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Complementary MRI modalities can reveal the nature and regional specificity of structural degradation that underlies and constrains the compensatory reorganization.  The overall aim of this project is to use a range of MRI-based methods to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult binge drinking men and women. Because of their spatial precision and sensitivity to different neural tissue properties and functional features, MRI-based methods can provide insights into structural and functional alterations at the level of an interactive system. Specifically, BOLD fMRI will evaluate functional activation during tasks that probe cognitive control; resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis will examine alterations at the level of a functional network, while structural degradation will be reflected in gray and white matter morphometric features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will characterize white matter microstructure and tract-based changes. These measures will be obtained from young adult men and women (18-30 yrs) who will be assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups based on their drinking patterns and will be equated on age, race/ethnicity, and family history of alcoholism. Interactions between binge drinking and sex will be examined in all analyses. Overall, we hypothesize that neural alterations will correlate with a range of alcohol-related variables, with greater deficits and increased compensatory activity observed in BDs who engage in higher intensity drinking, with BD women being especially susceptible to functional deficits and structural degradation. Data will be integrated across imaging modalities in a machine learning classifier framework that will inform a predictive model of drinking trajectories based on 6-mos and 12-mos longitudinal follow-ups. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, personality and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the type and extend of the neural degradation underlying executive deficits and compensatory brain reorganization. NARRATIVE  The overall aim of this project is to use a multimodal MRI approach to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult men and women engaging in binge drinking. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, dispositional measures and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the neural degradation underlying altered activity and brain reorganization.",Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers,9825320,R21AA027371,"['Address', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'System', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Woman', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'binge drinker', 'binge drinking', 'cognitive control', 'design', 'drinking', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'hazardous drinking', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'male', 'men', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scale up', 'sex', 'white matter', 'young adult', 'young woman']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,216344,0.0713824338294027
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9709183,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol involvement', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care systems', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'real time model', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'relative cost', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor', 'wearable device']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,381816,0.09498747623593017
"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9692448,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Applied Skills', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disease classification', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'global health', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2019,131850,0.0985288911033748
"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,9787254,R01AA027264,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Non-linear Models', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Social Network', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Walking', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'model design', 'novel', 'online registry', 'open data', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'simulation', 'simulation game', 'syntax', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment effect', 'treatment trial', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web app']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,680219,0.08884398590569326
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,9698853,U24AA021697,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Heart Rate', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Saccades', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Visit', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol expectancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'binge drinking', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data sharing', 'data submission', 'drinking', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'informatics infrastructure', 'information processing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,SRI INTERNATIONAL,U24,2019,1111508,0.13457726030922357
"Fourth International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer ABSTRACT A contribution of alcohol to the development of several cancers, including esophageal, laryngeal, lung, breast (in women) and colorectal (especially in men), is becoming increasingly evident. Each year, 390,000 cases of cancer world-wide are attributable to alcohol consumption, representing 3.6% of all newly diagnosed cancers. The International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer (ICAC) was established in 2010 to complement the major research conferences in cancer (e.g. AACR) and alcohol (e.g., RSA, ISBRA, ESBRA) which do not have a focus on the role of alcohol in carcinogenesis. After the success of the first three meetings (in Heidelberg, Germany in 2011; Breckenridge, USA in 2013; and Crete, Greece in 2015), we are now in the process of organizing our fourth conference. The conferences have been successful in bringing together over fifty investigators (from sixteen nations) with cutting-edge and complementary expertise in alcohol and cancer. In addition to allowing experts to share their most current results, the conference has promoted interactions between basic scientists and clinicians in all major aspects of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis. In so doing, it has fostered the development of valuable new collaborations that promote major advances in the field. An important secondary function of this conference is to attract young scientists and graduate students into this important field of research. This R13 application seeks mostly travel support for new investigators, and pre- and post-doctoral trainees to allow attendance at the fourth ICAC to be held in Newport, Rhode Island, USA, on April 14-18, 2019. The conference will remain faithful to and build upon the previous conferences by achieving the following specific aims: i) provide a venue for the presentation of cutting-edge research in the field of alcohol and cancer; ii) promote the development of new ideas and research directions by fostering interactions and collaborations between researchers from a variety of sub-specialties and disciplines; iii) foster interactions between young investigators (including postgraduate and graduate students) and established investigators; iv) facilitate distribution of new scientific and translational information to the professional and lay communities, and v) disseminate the findings of the meeting to a wider audience by publishing the presentations. It is anticipated that these conferences will continue to enhance our understanding of the role played by alcohol in carcinogenesis and thereby facilitate the development of treatments that will prevent or treat cancers caused by alcohol. PROJECT NARRATIVE The contribution of alcohol to the development of a variety of cancers is becoming increasingly evident. The proposed meeting will focus on recent advances in epidemiology, molecular mechanisms and biomarkers of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis, and the emerging areas of systems approaches, big data, deep learning and artificial intelligence. As has been the case previously, this meeting will function as an ideal platform for promoting interactions between basic scientists and clinicians in all major aspects of alcohol-induced carcinogenesis. In addition, it will serve to attract young scientists and graduate students into this important field of research.",Fourth International Conference on Alcohol and Cancer,9771126,R13AA027725,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American Association of Cancer Research', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crete', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Endocrinologist', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Esophageal', 'Fostering', 'Germany', 'Greece', 'Inflammation', 'International', 'Larynx', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Oral', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rhode Island', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'System', 'Travel', 'Woman', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer stem cell', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'deep learning', 'graduate student', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'men', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'prevent', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy development']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R13,2019,30000,0.03332080617855934
"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9824096,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,174994,0.07975400295300018
"Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder 1 Project Summary/Abstract  2 Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition and a major public health problem with few  3 pharmaceutical treatments available. Systems-based computational strategies that integrate brain gene  4 expression signatures of rodent models of AUD risk with gene expression signatures of pharmaceuticals show  5 promise for identifying compounds that decrease excessive drinking in rodents. However, this methodology  6 has limited clinical potential because it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from patients. Identifying a  7 clinically accessible tissue would facilitate the application of advanced computational approaches to identify  8 better therapeutics for AUD and personalize AUD treatment. To this end, the proposed research aims to  9 determine whether blood can be used as a surrogate tissue for brain by using a within-subjects design to 10 compare transcript levels in both tissues in mice during protracted withdrawal, a sensitive time for relapse to 11 excessive alcohol drinking. The research will also determine whether whole blood transcriptome profiles can be 12 used to classify subjects according to alcohol dependence status and to computationally predict compounds 13 that reduce alcohol consumption and anxiety- and depression-like behavior. The clinical and mechanistic 14 insights that will emerge from the proposed research should be considered independently. The first could lead 15 to effective diagnostic tools or candidate treatments, whereas the second will provide insight into the 16 pathophysiology of AUD. It might be the case that the blood transcriptome at least partially reflects the changes 17 in brain, and that targeting these changes is therapeutic. Or it might be the case that targeting the blood 18 transcriptome is therapeutic, irrespective of brain changes. The proposed study will provide crucial new 19 knowledge about a relatively new and unexplored area of addiction research that could drive molecular-based 20 diagnostic or therapeutic tools and personalized medicine approaches for AUD or other diseases where brain is 21 the primary affected tissue. Project Narrative Recent evidence in mice suggests that brain gene expression profiles can predict drugs effective for treating alcoholism, but it is not possible to obtain brain specimens from human patients which limits the usefulness of this approach. This research will investigate the extent to which blood can act as a surrogate for brain tissue and predict alcohol dependence status and drug treatments. This information will help to develop molecular- based diagnosis and treatment options for alcoholics and gain insights into the biological mechanisms that might contribute to the transition from recreational alcohol use to excessive drinking.",Transcriptome-guided diagnosis and therapy for alcohol use disorder,9906637,F32AA028148,"['Acids', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol withdrawal syndrome', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Ethanol', 'Expression Profiling', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Libraries', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Marble', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pergolide', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Schizophrenia', 'Specimen', 'Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region', 'System', 'Tail Suspension', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Whole Blood', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol use disorder', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain tissue', 'clinical development', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'drug candidate', 'forced swim test', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'negative affect', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'problem drinker', 'random forest', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vapor']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",F32,2019,61226,0.10732560105135869
"Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of this study is to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that link acute alcohol intoxication with cigarette use in young nondaily smokers (ages 21-25). Nondaily smokers experience fewer symptoms of cigarette withdrawal than daily smokers; however, they still experience difficulty quitting. Since smoking cessation before the age of 30 substantially attenuates the long-term health consequences associated with smoking, understanding the factors that motivate cigarette use in young nondaily smokers and developing tailored interventions will be critical for curbing cigarette use and improving public health. The proposed project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how acute alcohol intoxication impacts brain function and will assess the extent to which alcohol-induced changes in brain function correlate with impulsive choice, cigarette craving, and craving regulation in young adults. Furthermore, we will assess how alcohol-induced changes in brain function, impulsivity, craving, and capacity for craving regulation predict cigarette use over the course of 1 year.  This K01 application advances the PI's long-term research goal of establishing an independent line of research examining neurobiological markers that confer risk for future substance use disorder using multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The proposed training plan will enable the PI to develop skills and expertise in five primary areas: 1) design and implementation of longitudinal studies, 2) task-based and resting- state fMRI, 3) advanced statistical methods, 4) the assessment of acute neurobiological responses to drugs and 5) the neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive choice. The training program combines formal coursework with mentorship from experienced consultants who are experts in the proposed areas of training. This project will leverage the intellectual and institutional support at OHSU and in Dr. Nagel's Developmental Brain Imaging Laboratory in order to develop a new line of research that will form the foundation for a career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although rates of cigarette use are declining, the proportion of nondaily smokers is rising, particularly among young adults. Among young adults, nondaily smoking is associated with negative health consequences and, for some, may lead to the establishment of life-long smoking patterns. The goal of this project is to understand the behavioral, psychological and neurobiological factors that contribute to cigarette use in nondaily smokers to aid the development of tailored evidence-based interventions.",Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers,9742727,K01DA046649,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Beverages', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cigarette', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol response', 'base', 'career', 'cigarette smoking', 'craving', 'design', 'discount', 'discounting', 'drinking', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'problem drinker', 'psychologic', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking intervention', 'therapeutic target', 'young adult']",NIDA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,183179,0.046146883505940796
"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared. Finally, an exploratory aim will use the PRS scores from the PGC data to generate risk scores in the lab sample to examine if there is a genetic association with conditioning deficits.  To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals. These goals will incorporate training in the epidemiology and genetics of AUD and PTSD, molecular and statistical genetics techniques, and conduct of clinical laboratory paradigms using genetic and psychophysiological measures. This training and resultant findings will capitalize on existing expertise and provide additional, focused training to allow for the development of a multimodal research program that uses large-scale genetic association findings to develop mechanism-focused laboratory studies that inform upon the development and maintenance of this complex presentation. The proposed research represents an important contribution towards advancing our understanding of the complicated and frequently comorbid phenotypes of AUD and PTSD. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing an independent research line that ultimately aims to decrease the burden of alcohol-related problems, consistent with NIAAA research priority. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur, and some of the genetic risk for these conditions is shared. This project aims to elucidate the shared molecular genetic risk and examine potential learning-based mechanisms common to both disorders, by linking large-scale genome-wide data with a clinical laboratory study. This K01 award will provide the candidate with the training necessary to pursue a multimodal program of research that aims to synthesize genetically informed research with laboratory studies of mechanism to inform upon the shared underpinnings of AUD and PTSD and advance work aimed at improving prevention and treatment efforts.",Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder,9689882,K01AA025692,"['Address', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Twin Studies', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular scale', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'psychogenetics', 'responsible alcohol use', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'trait', 'trauma exposure']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,172364,0.05997598019930215
"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9753834,K25AA025095,"['Affect', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'New South Wales', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Siblings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'endophenotype', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenomics', 'family structure', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'risk sharing', 'statistics', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2019,161460,0.1475075889190427
"Targeting corticostriatal synchrony with deep brain stimulation to reduce alcohol drinking Project Summary  Although alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects a large segment of American adults and the current treatments are unsuccessful in a significant proportion of patients. Studying the neural underpinnings of AUD has the potential for uncovering target for developing novel treatments. There is mounting evidence that AUD is correlated with dysregulated synchrony within the corticostriatal network. Neuromodulatory therapies, like deep brain stimulation (DBS), have been successful at treating other disorders, like Parkinson's disease, characterized by network dysregulation. Although, DBS has also shown the potential to treat AUD in pre- clinical models and clinical studies, the variable response to treatment (~50% of subject) limits the clinical adoption of these techniques. If we are able to uncover which measures of corticostriatal synchrony are implicated in the therapeutic effects of DBS, then we could target those features to increase response rates and open the door to a new therapeutic approach to AUD.  The short-term objective of this research is to uncover the synchrony measure indicative of successful DBS treatment of AUD and then improve outcomes by targeting that measure with a novel DBS approach. The longer-term objective is to develop a novel treatment modality—dual-site DBS—which could be used to target dysregulated synchrony between two brain regions by targeting both of those regions. To achieve both of these objectives, (Aim 1) I will use a rodent model of alcohol drinking and an unbiased computational approach to determine what corticostriatal synchrony measure best correlates with successful single-site DBS. Next (Aim 2a), I will determine if dual-site DBS can be optimized to selectively modulate the measure previously associated with alcohol drinking. Last, (Aim 2b) I will test the ability of dual-site DBS to alter both synchrony and drinking behavior compared to single-site DBS.  These aims will not only provide a brain network-based biomarker of successful AUD treatment, but also begin the development of an innovative treatment. To complete these aims I will work with my mentorship team at Dartmouth College on the use of animal models of alcohol use, the analysis of local field potentials, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms. Dartmouth College not only provides cutting-edge facilities which I will use to complete this research, but also has dedicated centers for professional development like the Dartmouth Center for the Advancement of Learning, which I will use over the next two years. Altogether, the training I will receive under this F31 will be integral in my pursuit of a pre-clinical research career. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects approximately 15 million adults in the United States with a particular need for new therapeutic options in the treatment resistant population. Brain network dysregulation is implicated in AUD, specifically dysregulated corticostriatal synchrony, and this proposal will uncover the relationship between corticostriatal synchrony induced by deep brain stimulation (DBS) and reduced alcohol drinking in an animal model. Further, this proposal will determine if a novel application of DBS is able to reduce alcohol drinking more than standard DBS by manipulating this dysregulated synchrony.",Targeting corticostriatal synchrony with deep brain stimulation to reduce alcohol drinking,9854732,F31AA027441,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Network-based', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rewards', 'Rodent Model', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pedagogy', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'reduced alcohol use', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'signal processing', 'symposium', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,F31,2019,45016,0.12195522778060748
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators.

"RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The research project outlined in this SBIR submission will develop the Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE) platform into a tool to promote sustained recovery in individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorder. In this proposal, the investigators intend to deploy the RAE system- consisting of a wearable sensor, a smartphone app, and a clinical portal- to provide individuals in recovery and their treatment providers with an opportunity to identify moments of high risk for relapse and to access real time intervention opportunities. Wearable biosensors are small, noninvasive devices that continuously record physiology. These sensors have the ability to detect digital biomarkers of drug use and stress, the latter of which herald an increased risk of relapse. RAE aims to utilize this capability to create a real-time solution for individuals in recovery. The components of RAE are: 1) The Empatica Embrace, a wrist mounted sensor similar in form factor to a smart watch, that continuously monitors skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA) and locomotion. Detection algorithms for stress and drug use will be embedded on the Embrace firmware. 2) The RAE smartphone application (app), for the individual in recovery. The app will be triggered either by detection of an event on the Embrace or manually by the user when needed and will provide multiple options for annotations, stress reduction techniques and immediate contact with individuals in the pre-defined support system via call or SMS text. The app will also log sleep, physical activity, and geographic location of events. 3) The RAE Portal, for the treatment provider, will deliver immediate alerts when an event is detected on the user’s device for the opportunity to intervene in real time and will also provide metrics on the user’s recorded activities. The research plan has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To deploy and optimize the RAE system in a population of individuals in treatment for substance use disorder and Aim 2) To demonstrate the impact of the RAE system on outcomes in substance use treatment. To achieve these aims the investigators will first deploy the technology in a population of individuals in recovery and collect data on accuracy, usability and functionality (Aim 1). The data from Aim 1 will be used to optimize the system and achieve millstones prior to transition to Aim 2 which will include sensitivity, specify, accuracy and user compliance targets. The investigators will then undertake a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of RAE on key outcomes including rates of relapse, retention in treatment programs, and psychosocial wellbeing. The investigators have assembled a leadership team and advisory team with the necessary expertise in business, medicine, wearable technology and engineering to develop RAE into a tool that dramatically improves the success of treatment for substance use disorder, promotes sustained sobriety, and reduces morbidity and mortality from relapse to substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to substance use disorder has reached staggering proportions, and treatment options suffer from high rates of relapse. RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage) is a mobile based solution that combines a wearable sensor, a smartphone app and a cloud based clinical portal to detect stress and drug use in individuals in treatment for substance use disorder. The goal of the RAE system is to provide real-time intervention tools for patients, to allow clinicians to personalize the treatment approach for each patient, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use disorder by improving the success of treatment programs.","RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders",9545385,R44DA046151,"['Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'Journals', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'User Compliance', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'active method', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'sobriety', 'software development', 'stress management', 'stress reduction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,"CONTINUEYOU, LLC",R44,2019,224991,0.051009099614709716
"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Understanding sex-specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence is a crucial step toward developing more informed prevention and treatment strategies.",Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence,9703801,R01AA017664,"['16 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Glare', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male Adolescents', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Sex Differences', 'Sex Functioning', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotional behavior', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,406172,0.15686126774775533
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),9768294,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'routine screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2019,340037,0.11742113533138542
"Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App? Development and Feasibility Testing of a StepAway 'Bot' PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A wide gap exists between the number of individuals needing alcohol treatment and those actually receiving it. Many factors account for this gap, including stigma, treatment availability and affordability, and individuals wanting to solve their problems independently. Technologically-delivered interventions may dramatically increase the number of individuals who receive needed alcohol intervention services due to their ability to circumvent treatment barriers. Smartphones are the ideal devices to provide empirically-supported intervention assistance whenever and wherever it is needed. Our research team previously developed and tested a stand-alone, self-administered smartphone-based intervention system for alcohol use disorders that was based on empirically supported face-to-face treatments. This Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A) system provided a progression through psychoeducational modules and in-the-moment interventions to reduce the likelihood of drinking. In a preliminary 6-week trial study, we contrasted the LBMI-A with a web-based intervention, the Drinker's Checkup (DCU) that was supplemented with bibliotherapy. While alcohol consumption was reduced by >50% in both interventions, only the LBMI-A produced a significant increase in percentage of days abstinent. Greater LBMI-A usage was associated with greater reductions in drinking. A revised and improved iPhone-based version, Step Away, has been developed and has been used by individuals downloading it from the iTunes App Store. Our Step Away usage data indicate that user engagement with modules that are not “pushed” to the user is relatively low, which is a problem that many health apps experience. A new method of delivering Step Away through an artificially intelligent chatbot will be developed in this study that holds potential for providing enhanced user engagement and effectiveness as it can reach out through a text interface to introduce new intervention steps and respond to the user with Step Away's in-the-moment help with having a craving, experiencing distress or needing social support. It could serve as a personal assistant that guides a user through a process of changing their drinking. This project will focus on developing a Step Away chatbot during the first phase of the study. We will also enhance the existing Step Away app's user interface for optimal usability. The second phase will entail performing a pilot study to determine if the Step Away chatbot has enhanced user engagement, intervention fidelity and outcome efficacy in comparison to the Step Away app among a group of problem drinkers. A control condition will consist of a minimal intervention; an assessment-only app. Participants will be interviewed to determine their perceptions of both interventions with a view towards understanding barriers to user engagement. Finally, this project will set the stage for a further, large-scale evaluation of Step Away, the content of which will be determined by the outcome of the pilot study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smartphone-based alcohol interventions hold potential to bridge the wide gap between the number of individuals needing alcohol intervention and those actually receiving it, but more research is needed about their outcome efficacy and the optimal way to engage users in this new type of intervention. This study will continue to refine an empirically supported smartphone app (Step Away) and develop a similarly focused chatbot that will serve as a personal assistant to an individual interested in changing their drinking. We will also perform a pilot study that will compare user engagement and alcohol outcome variables across the two approaches.",Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App?

"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ﬁxed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiﬁc reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9756356,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,486320,0.06217478694660745
"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders.

"1-D Titania Nanostructure Based Wearable Alcohol Sensor with Tunable Sensitivity and Artificial Intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop an artificially intelligent alcohol sensor that is wearable, non- invasive, smart, and aesthetic. The aim, in Phase I, is to design and develop the alcohol sensor based on metal (i.e., Cobalt) functionalized Titanium nanotubes (TiNT) to detect, monitor, and display blood alcohol levels in real-time using microcontrollers-based wrist-band like devices. At the core of our innovation, we have Cobalt- functionalized TiNT sensors which are capable of detecting alcohol exposure from the skin in 1ppm level that can be tuned down to 1ppb level as well (i.e., sensitivity of the sensor is tunable). The control unit of our system is reusable, sensors are replaceable, the microcontrollers are equipped with a micro-SD card for personal-data storage, and the proposed unit has a built-in wireless system for data transmission. This proposal also aims, in Phase II, to create an integrated artificially intelligent (AI) network that will have the capabilities of (a) translating the real-time data into a pre-cautious safety signals that will communicate with the personal vehicle safety features through a wireless signal (i.e., Bluetooth), and (c) adaptively taking unattended decisions-on-demand (DoD) through machine learning when the driver is heavily intoxicated. 1 Project Narrative Breath-analyzers within the law enforcement settings alone cannot tackle the problems associated with alcohol consumptions and abuse. Recently developed wearable alcohol sensor technologies mostly rely on wet-electrochemical environments around the skin. Therefore, we propose to develop wearable alcohol sensor using titania nanotube which will be dry, non- invasive, artificially intelligent, and aesthetic.

"Identifying Children and Teens at Risk for Early Onset Alcohol Use: An Innovative Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Prevention PROJECT SUMMARY Early onset of alcohol use during adolescence is associated with increased probability of later alcohol dependence, polydrug abuse, victimization, conduct problems, psychiatric comorbidities, and delayed achievement of adult milestones. Methods that yield rapid, accurate, and reliable predictions of which children and teens are at risk for early onset can improve the targeting of prevention interventions and enable the concentration of resources on the most debilitating and costly cases. One promising and untapped approach to this prediction problem is machine learning (also called “statistical learning,” “data mining,” or “predictive modeling”), a class of techniques arising from statistics, computer science, and engineering that seeks to build data-driven predictive algorithms. These techniques are most noticeably distinguished from “traditional” statistical methods (e.g., ordinary least squares regression) by their extreme emphasis on prediction of future cases, rather than explanation of the current data, and thus they may offer dramatic advantages over traditional approaches to identifying which children and teens will develop early onset alcohol use. This proposal will explore the potential contribution of machine learning methods by directly comparing their predictive performance to that of the traditional approach in a large-scale, multisite longitudinal study of the development of early onset alcohol use (N = 731). If machine learning methods do significantly outperform the traditional approach, future directions might include the development and implementation of machine-learning- based screening methods for real-world use. On the other hand, if machine learning methods do not outperform the traditional approach, this will suggest that at least in the context of the present study (i.e., these predictors, timeline, and outcome), machine learning does not improve the prediction of early onset alcohol use. Analyses will investigate whether the performance of machine learning methods varies across the nature of predictor variables use, the age span covered, and the outcome to be predicted. Thus, the current proposal uses an extant longitudinal dataset to carry out two specific aims: (1) Train five different machine learning algorithms and one traditional algorithm (ordinary logistic regression) for predicting later early onset alcohol use in a subset (70%) of the data. (2) Test these six predictive algorithms on the rest (30%) of the data and directly compare their predictive performance in multiple contexts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prospectively predicting which children and teens are at risk for early onset alcohol use enables targeted implementation of preventive interventions. Machine learning is a promising yet untapped approach that may be well-suited to this task. This study investigates the potential of several machine learning algorithms to contribute to the rapid, accurate, and reliable identification of individuals at risk for early onset alcohol use.",Identifying Children and Teens at Risk for Early Onset Alcohol Use: An Innovative Application of Machine Learning Algorithms to Prevention,9540250,F31AA026768,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advertising', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Engineering', 'Fraud', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Lasso', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol screening', 'base', 'computer science', 'conduct problem', 'cost', 'data mining', 'early alcohol use', 'early onset', 'field study', 'forest', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidrug abuse', 'outcome prediction', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'screening', 'search engine', 'spam', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'success', 'underage drinking', 'vector']",NIAAA,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2018,44524,0.09417297013999525
"A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with significant health and psychosocial consequences. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority (85%-90%) of individuals believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Gait analysis, is one of the most reliable way to determine intoxication in humans. We developed AlcoGait, a smartphone-based alcohol tracking technology that passively infers level of drinking from gait impairment. In the current study, we will continue to refine AlcoGait's machine learning algorithms to passively analyze gait and trunk sway data in order to accurately determine gait impairment associated with elevated BrAC levels, particularly .08 g%. While the use of smartphone technology to conduct gait analysis has been employed with various patient populations, it has yet to be utilized for assessing gait in the context of alcohol intoxication. We will administer alcohol to 250 participants in a laboratory setting. We will collect gait and trunk sway data from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope at preset breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels up to the legal limit of .08g%. In Stage 1 (technology preparation), we will program the AlcoGait 2.0 smartphone application to passively gather and export both accelerometer and gyroscope data (gait information) based on the first 10 participants. In Stage 2 (data gathering, analysis and machine learning), the next 190 participants will serve as a “training set,” providing input data for AlcoGait 2.0; these data will allow for the comparison of 4 classifiers types (machine-learning methodologies) that infer BrAC levels associated with impairment, particularly with .08 g%, using gait and trunk sway data. In Stage 3, the best performing classifier as determined using the training set will be programmed into the final AlcoGait 2.0 app and validated with an additional 50 participants completing the alcohol administration laboratory study (“validation set”). AlcoGait 2.0's ability to accurately associate gait impairment with legal intoxication would represent a great advance over other smartphone applications that require the user to manually record and track amount, time, and types of alcohol consumption. With our app's focus on motor impairment, we see our primary users as those who, despite subjective perceptions or counting drinks, are unable to estimate their BrAC accurately but would want to know if they are too impaired to drive. This technology could be used preventively to alert drinkers of impairment and intoxication in real time, mitigating negative consequences. Passive smartphone-based sensing technologies present minimal burden to users and can have ubiquitous impact as smartphones are now widely owned across all ages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups. Project Narrative Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority of individuals do not receive formal alcohol treatment, often because they believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Smartphone technology, leveraging the long-studied connection between alcohol intoxication and gait impairment, allows alcohol use self-monitoring to enter a new era. Such technology, as pioneered in our phone app Alcogait, where gait is passively recorded during usual activities, could be used preventively to alert drinkers when they are passing various blood alcohol concentrations, and when they are legally intoxicated in real time based on gait impairment.",A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data,9532068,R21AA025193,"['18 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Preventive', 'Reporting', 'Sample Size', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol content', 'base', 'behavior change', 'binge drinking', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'brief intervention', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'gait examination', 'impaired driving performance', 'improved', 'mobile computing', 'motor impairment', 'patient population', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'sensor technology', 'smartphone Application', 'socioeconomics']",NIAAA,"BUTLER HOSPITAL (PROVIDENCE, RI)",R21,2018,176960,0.09531951127502225
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9538549,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical implementation', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,602663,0.15080623718502606
"Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media Consumption of cancer causing products (CCPs) is the root cause of many of the cancers and chronic diseases we aim to cure with translational medicine. Tobacco and alcohol consumption is a function of highly successful, coordinated global business models that promote consumption. The marketing of CCPs can be seen as a disease vector that drives CCP consumption and worthy of surveillance. The present project addresses the marketing of tobacco and alcohol to young people in the current media environment, in which youths increasingly stream their entertainment in a relatively commercial free environment. To address decreasing reach of traditional advertising, companies have sought to embed their brands in the entertainment itself. Alcohol companies actively seek entertainment placement deals. While cigarette companies have agreed not to pay for product placement, they may evade current restrictions by burying placements in the massive streamed entertainment environment. E-cigarette companies have no such restrictions and advertise on television. Youths obtain exposure to brands that spend more on advertising (e.g., Budweiser); these are also the most commonly consumed brands by youth. Product placement exposures may put adolescents at greater risk for CCP consumption. This study represents the first step in assessing that risk--to obtain infoveillance on CCP brand prevalence in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 involves a partnership with machine learning researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop and validate a computer recognition system for major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brands in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 relies on an existing, large Dartmouth media training library that includes detailed timing for tobacco and alcohol brands from over 2000 contemporary movies. JPL researchers will use the Dartmouth media library, combined with a large corpus of brand logos retrieved from the web, to train and validate an automated Video Content Coding (VCC) system that identifies content associated with key alcohol and tobacco brands. The VCC system will leverage recent techniques to construct robust object detection systems using Convolutional Neural Networks built on large image databases, along with text extraction methods to identify brand names in advertising logos. Second, we will deploy the automated recognition system on the Dartmouth computer cluster to assess the frequency of major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brand placements from a large sample of streamed/cable and movie entertainment. This proposal involves a unique multidisciplinary team of Dartmouth behavioral scientists and NASA machine learning scientists who will leverage new technologies to study a significant CCP marketing platform. The novel approach offers unprecedented opportunities to conduct surveillance on CCP marketing in large media samples. Our project will set the stage for future research on exposure to this type of marketing and its relation to CCP consumption in youths and lead to a better understanding of the risks CCP brand placements pose to health. Project Narrative This project addresses the potential exposure of youth to marketing of cancer causing products— tobacco and alcohol— in the popular commercial-free streaming environment, where products are embedded in the media itself through product placement. We will employ machine learning to develop an automated visual recognition system for major tobacco and alcohol brands and deploy that system to evaluate brand placement in a large sample of streamed entertainment from cable (e.g., HBO) and other (e.g., Netflix Originals) companies. This surveillance program will have the capability to monitor embedded marketing across many platforms and ultimately allow us to assess youth exposure to embedded brands and its relation with early onset of tobacco and alcohol use.",Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media,9503952,R01CA225845,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Alcohols', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Businesses', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Influenza', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Stream', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Surveillance', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'computer cluster', 'computerized', 'drinking', 'early onset', 'handheld mobile device', 'innovation', 'movie', 'movie exposure', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco exposure', 'translational medicine']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2018,627735,0.04330586127749458
"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,9426777,R01AA026368,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assimilations', 'Biosensor', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Concentration measurement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol response', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'data reduction', 'diaries', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'physiologic model', 'population based', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'time interval', 'time use', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,586877,0.10549107362761181
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs.

"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9477551,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Applied Skills', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disease classification', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'global health', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2018,136230,0.0985288911033748
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9493347,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol involvement', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care systems', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'real time model', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'relative cost', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor', 'wearable device']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2018,381816,0.09498747623593017
"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,9643182,R01AA027264,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Non-linear Models', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Social Network', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Walking', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'model design', 'novel', 'open data', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'simulation', 'simulation game', 'syntax', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment effect', 'treatment trial', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web app']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,715938,0.08884398590569326
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.

This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the “gateway interactions” between use of different substances. This hub’s Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factors, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Alcohol consumption monitoring via a power-free wearable biosensor ABSTRACT: LogicInk will design and develop a discrete, low-cost, wearable alcohol-sensor that works via detection of ethanol in sweat and requires no power supply. The wearable device will let users better understand the impact of their drinking habits on their body, as reflected by alcohol concentration levels over time. These discrete, electronics-free wearables that resemble temporary tattoos will change color based on alcohol content in sweat. The color changes will be directly readable by the wearer requiring no additional equipment. In parallel, we will develop computer vision algorithms that will detect, record, and interpret the wearable’s colors in much greater detail for the user. These algorithms will serve as the basis for the development of a personalized mobile application that can track a users’ alcohol consumption over time.  Approximately 6.8% of adults and 20% of college students in the US have alcohol use disorder (AUD) and the economic burden of alcohol misuse is $249.0 billion. An alcohol-impaired driver is a factor in over a third of all traffic-related deaths. A significant problem with alcohol consumption is that drinkers’ recall of the amount consumed is poor, as is judgment regarding the degree of impairment. The LogicInk biosensor utilizes a novel concentration metric that grants users a better understanding of the impact of their drinking habits on their body, as reflected by approximated transdermal alcohol levels. Additionally, the optional coupling to a mobile phone application allows users to track and analyze values over time. A simple, accurate, and inexpensive method to approximate cumulative alcohol consumption is a promising strategy to raise alcohol consumption awareness across a wide user demographic.  The concentration of ethanol in sweat is highly correlated with blood alcohol concentrations (BACs) and has been used in many transdermal BAC devices. We will test the hypothesis that the biosensor can approximate blood alcohol levels and the amount of alcohol consumed since applying the sensor. We will have two aims in this proposal: Aim 1, Design and characterization of a cumulative alcohol biosensor, and Aim 2, Development and training of computer vision algorithms that will be used to track cumulative alcohol levels. PROJECT NARRATIVE: LogicInk is developing a discrete, low-cost, wearable alcohol-sensor that works via detection of ethanol in sweat and requires no power supply. Our wearable device will let users better understand the impact of their drinking habits on their body, as reflected by easily interpreted color changes correlated to blood alcohol concentration levels over time. Ultimately, we expect this device will result in users drinking more moderately, reducing the many adverse effects from excessive alcohol consumption.",Alcohol consumption monitoring via a power-free wearable biosensor,9608596,R43AA026242,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Biosensor', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Car Phone', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Colorimetry', 'Companions', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronics', 'Equipment', 'Ethanol', 'Eye', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Power Sources', 'Reaction', 'Readability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Sweat', 'System', 'Tattooing', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol content', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'drinking', 'improved', 'man', 'men', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'skin color', 'theories', 'trend', 'university student', 'wearable device', 'young adult']",NIAAA,LOGICINK CORPORATION,R43,2018,223945,0.0979618178776761
"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ﬁxed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiﬁc reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9576900,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,543369,0.06217478694660745
"Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder Project Summary  Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common outcomes following trauma that are frequently comorbid, and this comorbidity is associated with greater symptom severity and poorer prognosis. Thus, efforts to better understand the etiology of these conditions is important for decreasing negative outcomes and improving prevention and treatment efforts, as much is still unknown regarding the etiology and mechanisms involved in their co-occurrence. Recent research has found that in addition to both phenotypes being moderately heritable, there is a modest degree of overlap in their latent genetic risk. Moreover, there is reason to suggest that fear-learning mechanisms frequently associated with PTSD may also be associated with AUD. Areas in need of further research include identification of molecular variation responsible for AUD/PTSD comorbidity, and extension of fear-learning models to AUD and comorbid AUD/PTSD populations. Developments in statistical procedures have afforded the ability to leverage genome- wide association data to answer key questions about these shared molecular underpinnings. The overarching goals of this K01 proposal are threefold. First, the study aims to use existing large-scale genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC; PTSD and Substance Use Disorders workgroups) to examine the molecular overlap via bivariate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability models, and determine if the polygenic risk score (PRS) from each disorder predicts case status in the other dataset. Second, a clinical laboratory study will be conducted using fear-conditioning paradigms in a trauma-exposed sample of diagnosis free controls, AUD, PTSD, and comorbid AUD/PTSD diagnostic groups to determine if deficits in learning are shared. Finally, an exploratory aim will use the PRS scores from the PGC data to generate risk scores in the lab sample to examine if there is a genetic association with conditioning deficits.  To achieve these aims, the candidate and multidisciplinary mentorship team have developed a comprehensive training plan that delineates a series of training and research goals. These goals will incorporate training in the epidemiology and genetics of AUD and PTSD, molecular and statistical genetics techniques, and conduct of clinical laboratory paradigms using genetic and psychophysiological measures. This training and resultant findings will capitalize on existing expertise and provide additional, focused training to allow for the development of a multimodal research program that uses large-scale genetic association findings to develop mechanism-focused laboratory studies that inform upon the development and maintenance of this complex presentation. The proposed research represents an important contribution towards advancing our understanding of the complicated and frequently comorbid phenotypes of AUD and PTSD. The institutional environment is ideal for the candidate's goal of developing an independent research line that ultimately aims to decrease the burden of alcohol-related problems, consistent with NIAAA research priority. Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly co-occur, and some of the genetic risk for these conditions is shared. This project aims to elucidate the shared molecular genetic risk and examine potential learning-based mechanisms common to both disorders, by linking large-scale genome-wide data with a clinical laboratory study. This K01 award will provide the candidate with the training necessary to pursue a multimodal program of research that aims to synthesize genetically informed research with laboratory studies of mechanism to inform upon the shared underpinnings of AUD and PTSD and advance work aimed at improving prevention and treatment efforts.",Overlap in genetic and learning-based mechanisms for alcohol use disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder,9445540,K01AA025692,"['Address', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fright', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Research Support', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Twin Studies', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol comorbidity', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'interest', 'laboratory experiment', 'molecular scale', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'psychogenetics', 'responsible alcohol use', 'risk sharing', 'skills', 'trait', 'trauma exposure']",NIAAA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,177833,0.05997598019930215
"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9534472,K25AA025095,"['Affect', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'New South Wales', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Siblings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'endophenotype', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenomics', 'family structure', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'risk sharing', 'statistics', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2018,161460,0.1475075889190427
"A Saliva Based Kit for the Epigenetic Assessment of Heavy Alcohol Intake Heavy alcohol use is common, yet avoidable cause of death, disability and human suffering. These adverse outcomes are potentially avoidable if heavy alcohol use is spotted early. However, current screening methods for chronic alcohol consumption capture alcohol usage only in the hours prior to testing or rely on insensitive, non-specific protein assays. In a recent highly successful Phase II project, using DNA from whole blood, we demonstrated that a combination of just two methylation sensitive droplet digital PCR (MSddPCR) assays could quite accurately identify subjects with recent heavy alcohol consumption. Since then, we have continued to advance those findings and have developed additional, even more powerful MSddPCR assays and refined our processes to only require the DNA found in a single drop of blood. In conjunction with our ethics and marketing team, we are now in the process of rolling this product nationwide.  However, a significant barrier to a more universal implementation of this disruptive technology is the requirement for blood. Conceivably, a test that could use the DNA from saliva could circumvent patient concerns about the discomfort of a needle or lancet stick. In addition, it would enable both non-medically oriented alcohol treatment programs and telemedicine oriented treatment programs to more easily assess client response to treatment. This will be particularly critical for treatment of alcoholism in the elderly, who are often unable or unwilling to travel to alcohol treatment facilities.  In this Phase I proposal, we intend to take the next steps to the creation of a saliva DNA screening test for heavy alcohol consumption. Already, we have collected and prepared saliva DNA on 150 subjects recently admitted to alcohol treatment and 150 age, gender and ethnicity matched controls. In addition, we have also developed an MSddPCR assay that can adjust for cellular heterogeneity in the saliva DNA.  In this application, we will use these resources to whether MSddPCR assessments of saliva DNA can also be used to detect heavy alcohol consumption. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will determine methylation status at 4 CpG loci with high predictive power for detecting alcohol consumption and one locus whose information content can be used to correct for cellular admixture in saliva. Then, in Aim 2, we will conduct a series of quality assessment of the saliva DNA. Finally, in Aim 3, we will analyze the data from our 4 highly predictive loci, correcting when necessary for cellular admixture, to determine an algorithm capable of predicting heavy alcohol use status. In addition, we will analyze the quality control measures to identify those saliva DNA samples which give unreliable. As a result of this project, we will produce a set of MSddPCR assays and a quality control metric for a rigorous multisite Phase II test of this “bloodless” NextGen product. Narrative Current diagnostic approaches for the assessment of heavy alcohol use normally use blood. However, many patients do not like to have their blood drawn or are cared for in a healthcare setting in which blood cannot be obtained. In this project, we will adapt our recently discovered DNA methylation based techniques to see if they can use saliva DNA instead of whole blood DNA.",A Saliva Based Kit for the Epigenetic Assessment of Heavy Alcohol Intake,9680049,R43AA027423,"['Abstinence', 'Admixture', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'CLIA certified', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Client', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Gender', 'Gene Dosage', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Hand', 'Health Personnel', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intellectual Property', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Needles', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality Control', 'RNase P', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resources', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Security', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Transportation', 'Travel', 'Whole Blood', 'adverse outcome', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol monitoring', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'digital', 'disability', 'health care settings', 'human DNA', 'improved', 'interest', 'next generation', 'phase 2 testing', 'product development', 'screening', 'social', 'technology validation', 'treatment program', 'treatment response']",NIAAA,"BEHAVIORAL DIAGNOSTICS, INC.",R43,2018,223260,0.07536032394166682
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood.

"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development,9482394,R01AA022493,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuropsychology', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spin Labels', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Task Performances', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Visit', 'adolescent alcohol and drug use', 'adolescent brain development', 'adolescent substance abuse', 'age related', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'design', 'early alcohol use', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'pediatrician', 'practice-based research network', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'spatial memory', 'underage drinking', 'way finding', 'white matter']",NIAAA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2018,428189,0.14091957050061044
"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism,9752706,R00AA024778,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Extramural Activities', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Review Literature', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'aged', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'faculty research', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'negative affect', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'predicting response', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2018,249000,0.14968487958640705
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),9564774,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'routine screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2018,369768,0.11742113533138542
"Targeting corticostriatal synchrony with deep brain stimulation to reduce alcohol drinking No abstract available Project Narrative Alcohol use disorder (AUD) affects approximately 15 million adults in the United States with a particular need for new therapeutic options in the treatment resistant population.

"A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with significant health and psychosocial consequences. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority (85%-90%) of individuals believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Gait analysis, is one of the most reliable way to determine intoxication in humans. We developed AlcoGait, a smartphone-based alcohol tracking technology that passively infers level of drinking from gait impairment. In the current study, we will continue to refine AlcoGait's machine learning algorithms to passively analyze gait and trunk sway data in order to accurately determine gait impairment associated with elevated BrAC levels, particularly .08 g%. While the use of smartphone technology to conduct gait analysis has been employed with various patient populations, it has yet to be utilized for assessing gait in the context of alcohol intoxication. We will administer alcohol to 250 participants in a laboratory setting. We will collect gait and trunk sway data from the smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope at preset breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) levels up to the legal limit of .08g%. In Stage 1 (technology preparation), we will program the AlcoGait 2.0 smartphone application to passively gather and export both accelerometer and gyroscope data (gait information) based on the first 10 participants. In Stage 2 (data gathering, analysis and machine learning), the next 190 participants will serve as a “training set,” providing input data for AlcoGait 2.0; these data will allow for the comparison of 4 classifiers types (machine-learning methodologies) that infer BrAC levels associated with impairment, particularly with .08 g%, using gait and trunk sway data. In Stage 3, the best performing classifier as determined using the training set will be programmed into the final AlcoGait 2.0 app and validated with an additional 50 participants completing the alcohol administration laboratory study (“validation set”). AlcoGait 2.0's ability to accurately associate gait impairment with legal intoxication would represent a great advance over other smartphone applications that require the user to manually record and track amount, time, and types of alcohol consumption. With our app's focus on motor impairment, we see our primary users as those who, despite subjective perceptions or counting drinks, are unable to estimate their BrAC accurately but would want to know if they are too impaired to drive. This technology could be used preventively to alert drinkers of impairment and intoxication in real time, mitigating negative consequences. Passive smartphone-based sensing technologies present minimal burden to users and can have ubiquitous impact as smartphones are now widely owned across all ages, ethnicities, and socioeconomic groups. Project Narrative Almost a quarter of the population aged 18 years and older reports binge drinking in the last month. Despite these high rates of problematic drinking, the majority of individuals do not receive formal alcohol treatment, often because they believe they can control drinking behavior on their own. Self-monitoring of drinking is key to behavior change, yet recent approaches utilizing mobile technology to collect real-time data have been limited by participant burden, poor compliance, and inaccuracy. Smartphone technology, leveraging the long-studied connection between alcohol intoxication and gait impairment, allows alcohol use self-monitoring to enter a new era. Such technology, as pioneered in our phone app Alcogait, where gait is passively recorded during usual activities, could be used preventively to alert drinkers when they are passing various blood alcohol concentrations, and when they are legally intoxicated in real time based on gait impairment.",A Machine Learning Approach for Inferring Alcohol Intoxication Levels from Gait Data,9307339,R21AA025193,"['18 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Learning', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Phonation', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Preventive', 'Reporting', 'Sample Size', 'Self-control as a personality trait', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol content', 'base', 'behavior change', 'binge drinking', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'brief intervention', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experimental study', 'forest', 'gait examination', 'impaired driving performance', 'improved', 'mobile computing', 'motor impairment', 'patient population', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'socioeconomics']",NIAAA,"BUTLER HOSPITAL (PROVIDENCE, RI)",R21,2017,228107,0.09531951127502225
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9334680,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,644254,0.15080623718502606
"Using the Lumme system to improve real-time blood alcohol detection PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a critical need to develop non-invasive technologies to monitor blood alcohol levels in real time. Such technology would advance research assessing drinking in the natural environment, clinical platforms intervening in real-time, and justice applications. Currently developed technology, transdermal alcohol sensors (TAS), passively detect alcohol intoxication by continuously testing for alcohol excreted in sweat. While such technology provides continuous monitoring of alcohol consumption, there are several significant shortcomings that limit its utility in research and clinical contexts. Limitations include lack of temporal resolution (i.e., delay between drinking and sweat detection), poor sensitivity of drinking episodes that do not meet binge criteria, and lack of information about drinking topography.  In response to PAR-16-410, we propose to pair our Lumme Inc behavioral tracking platform with a TAS device to improve the detection of real-time drinking behavior. The Lumme system combines the use of existing commercial hardware (smartwatch and smartphone) to assess drinking behavior in real time. The Lumme system uses inertial measurement units to record the movement of a person’s arm in three dimensional space with accelerometers and gyroscope contained in a smartwatch. Arm movements associated with drinking are distinctive, and can be accurately captured with a machine learning algorithm. The combined Lumme/TAS system complements one another’s strengths by providing detailed drinking data that can be linked to subsequent increases in blood alcohol content (BAC). The combined system will be able to accurately track drinking variables of interest to researchers and clinicians (e.g., start/end of drinking, length of drinking episode, rate of drinking, activity while drinking, social networks while drinking, location of drinking, and resulting BAC). Additionally, the gesture data can remotely capture low level drinking episodes that are undetected by existing TAS systems. We currently have a funded SBIR from NCI to develop and validate a smoking cessation platform using the Lumme system.  For the current application, we will propose a Phase I study to establish the feasibility and initial validity of using the combined Lumme/TAS system for tracking alcohol use behavior in real time. We plan to video record ad-libitum drinking behavior in heavy drinkers fitted with both a TAS system (BACtrack Skyn) and our Lumme system. The data collected in the clinical setting will act as ground truth which will be used to train our machine learning algorithm that will be sensitive to (i) how drinking gestures may change as blood alcohol levels rise (ii) how gestures may be affected by type of alcohol and the drinking vessel.  To our knowledge, the Lumme system would be the first system to remotely detect drinking gestures using a machine learning algorithm. In addition to improving real-time BAC detection technology the Lumme system could be also developed to deliver just-in-time interventions for problem drinking. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use results in 88,000 annual deaths in the US and has an annual economic burden on $249 billion. We are proposing to pair our Lumme Inc behavioral tracking platform with a transdermal alcohol sensor device to improve the detection of real-time drinking behavior in non-clinical settings.",Using the Lumme system to improve real-time blood alcohol detection,9464482,R43AA026492,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Beverages', 'Big Data', 'Blood', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Economic Burden', 'Environment', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Hand', 'Intervention', 'Justice', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Length', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Oral cavity', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Network', 'Sweat', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'alcohol monitoring', 'alcohol testing', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'complement system', 'design', 'detector', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'phase 1 study', 'programs', 'response', 'sensor', 'smoking cessation', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement']",NIAAA,"LUMME, INC.",R43,2017,224228,0.10432636511770171
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs.

"Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System (PEARRS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Over a quarter of primary care patients in the United States can be classified as unhealthy drinkers because their alcohol use conveys a high risk of health and social consequences. Unfortunately, unhealthy drinking is under-recognized in spite of the existence of valid screening tools. Even when unhealthy drinking is recognized, barriers such as provider discomfort, shortage of time, and stigma can inhibit appropriate care.  The objective of this proposal is to develop and test a new product to support detection and management of unhealthy drinking in medical settings. The Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System (PEARRS) will improve clinical practice by combining existing proprietary software with two novel components. The first uses modern machine learning techniques and widely available pre-existing patient data (such as routine lab test results) to build an algorithm that will identify patients likely to be unhealthy drinkers. Publicly available national survey data will be used to develop a prediction model that will then be tested with a clinical data set. The second component is a data system (database, mobile app and related software) that interacts with the patient, providing proven behavior change interventions such as goal setting, self-monitoring, and feedback, while simultaneously providing decision support to primary care providers. Iterative software development approaches will be used to create an app with a simple user interface and reporting functions.  PEARRS will provide a sophisticated tool for managing unhealthy alcohol use that will enable better quality of care, treatment outcomes, and cost savings.  AIM 1: To develop an algorithm to identify adults at elevated risk for unhealthy drinking  based on pre-existing objective laboratory tests.  AIM 2: To develop a prototype data system to actively engage patients and providers and  support evidence-based self-guided behavior change.  PEARRS addresses an unmet need for a low-cost method to reduce the clinical, social and financial burden of unhealthy alcohol use and will improve upon the status quo because laboratory markers will be used as screeners instead of self-report measures that are inconsistently used and can provoke resistance. Further, PEARRS will relieve providers of the need to perform a task they feel underprepared and unrewarded for.  The commercial applicability of this technological innovation is high because it is portable and relevant to a broad market of insurers, employers, accountable care organizations (ACOs) and others at risk for the consequences of unhealthy alcohol use. The impact PEARRS will have is substantial because it can overcome known barriers to providing alcohol evaluation and treatment services in general medical settings. PEARRS represents a fundamental shift in how unhealthy drinking is managed in medical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE  In some people, alcohol consumption can cause or complicate medical problems, accidents, lost productivity and crime. Although effective methods exist to identify unhealthy drinkers and help them reduce their risks, they are not widely used. We propose using routine laboratory data to identify individuals whose drinking may put them at risk for health problems or complications, and a data system with mobile app to offer them evidence-based behavior change interventions.",Patient Engagement Alcohol Risk Reduction System (PEARRS),9407982,R41AA025297,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Businesses', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Cost Savings', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Evaluation', 'Familiarity', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Staff', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Practice Management', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vermont', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol monitoring', 'alcohol risk reduction', 'base', 'behavior change', 'brief intervention', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'demographics', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'population health', 'portability', 'primary care setting', 'productivity loss', 'prototype', 'screening', 'social', 'social stigma', 'software development', 'success', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web site']",NIAAA,"VERMEDX, INC.",R41,2017,150001,0.12156726269536242
"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9265365,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Applied Skills', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phonation', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disease classification', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'global health', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2017,141339,0.0985288911033748
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9275293,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol involvement', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'real time model', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'relative cost', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,381816,0.09498747623593017
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive drinking in adolescence disrupts healthy development and leads to adverse social, economic and health consequences later in life. Although existing research focuses primarily on individual-level causes, neighborhood context is increasingly recognized as an upstream determinant of alcohol use. Yet since most prior neighborhood research on health has not been experimental, it is potentially biased, and weakens the foundation for policy translation. Our study proposes a secondary analysis of newly-available data from a social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study), to test whether, how, and why random assignment of an offer to move to a low- poverty neighborhood over a 15 year period influenced the alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence of adolescents and their mothers. We will complement existing data with additional neighborhood- level data to enrich the dataset and test multilevel hypotheses. MTO is the only available large-scale study that has randomly assigned families to receive different neighborhood housing contexts, to support strong causal inferences of how early-life neighborhood context shapes alcohol use. When launched, MTO was one of the most promising policies to reverse the damaging effects of neighborhood poverty for minority families. But health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. Since residential mobility experiments like MTO are rare, expensive, and since MTO profoundly affected substance use, it is crucial to probe its effects. We propose new secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this RCT, using novel methods to test mediation and moderation, applied to alcohol outcome measures that have not been examined prior. We apply innovative methods for assessing mediation (i.e., weight-based causal methods) and effect modification (i.e., machine learning techniques). Aside from the RCT design for strong causal inference of how early-life neighborhood changes influence excessive drinking, we also leverage one of the few longitudinal intervention designs sampling both mothers and their children, to illuminate familial transmission of drinking as it emerges in adolescence. Our R21 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO study, and proposes 3 aims: to test how moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in the MTO experiment influenced excessive drinking and alcohol dependence; to examine if the MTO experimental effect on excessive drinking and alcohol dependence was less beneficial for more vulnerable families; to test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in MTO for excessive drinking and alcohol dependence were mediated by individual-level stress; family-level context; or neighborhood-level stress, alcohol availability, or alcohol norms. The results will enrich our understanding of neighborhood and family context as a cause of excessive drinking and alcohol use in adolescents and adults, and inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will test mediation and moderation of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence, among adolescents and their mothers, to probe whether, why, and among whom neighborhood context earlier in life is a cause of alcohol use across 15 years. This knowledge will inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policies. Because of its experimental design, results will inform causal pathways and potential intervention points, including during childhood, by which to reduce the population burden of alcohol use.",Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use,9212070,R21AA024530,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Complement', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Household Heads', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Male Adolescents', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residential Mobility', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Son', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Victimization', 'Weight', 'Youth', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol prevention', 'base', 'boys', 'contextual factors', 'density of AOD outlets', 'design', 'drinking', 'early drinking', 'excessive drinking in adolescence', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'girls', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lower income families', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'therapy design', 'transmission process', 'underage drinking', 'volunteer', 'voucher']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2017,183049,0.12071408959502618
"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9321946,K25AA025095,"['Affect', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'New South Wales', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Siblings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'endophenotype', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenomics', 'family structure', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'risk sharing', 'statistics', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2017,161460,0.1475075889190427
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents.

We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices.

"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood.

"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development,9269497,R01AA022493,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuropsychology', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spin Labels', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Task Performances', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Visit', 'adolescent alcohol', 'adolescent brain development', 'adolescent substance abuse', 'age related', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'design', 'early alcohol use', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'pediatrician', 'practice-based research network', 'public health relevance', 'reduce adolescent alcohol', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'spatial memory', 'underage drinking', 'way finding', 'white matter']",NIAAA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2017,493698,0.14091957050061044
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),9335217,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2017,368340,0.11742113533138542
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.            ",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9104711,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'meetings', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,647176,0.15080623718502606
"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM). Therefore, these studies provide an opportunity to have a dramatic and immediate impact on our ability to address the unmet medical needs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.",A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse,9035335,R01AA021661,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'FDA approved', 'Finland', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Institutes', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Welfare', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Typology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'alcohol research', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'forest', 'hazardous drinking', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'named group', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'protein biomarkers', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'tool']",NIAAA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2016,344250,0.08695721096505205
"How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""How cannabis use affects alcohol treatment outcomes"" Introduction: While some suggest that cannabis use is related to increase drinking among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD), others have found that cannabis may substitute for alcohol and therefore reduce alcohol consumption among these individuals. However, no study has prospectively examined whether cannabis use is associated with increases or decreases in alcohol use in individuals in treatment for AUD. Primary aims: The primary aims of this study are to examine the effects of changes in cannabis use (i.e., increased vs. decreased use) during AUD treatment on post-treatment (immediately after treatment; one year, three years post-treatment) alcohol use and related problems. We will also investigate potential moderators (e.g., baseline dependence severity, social support) and mediators (e.g., alcohol cravings) of the relationship between cannabis use and AUD treatment outcomes. Preliminary analyses will also examine differences between those who use vs. do not use cannabis. Design: The proposed study is a secondary analysis of the two largest AUD treatment studies undertaken in the United States: the COMBINE Study and Project MATCH. Methods: Our sample consists of individuals with AUD who use cannabis but are not polysubstance dependent. Analyses will employ novel, highly sophisticated statistical methods, including Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) and Super Learner. TMLE and Super Learner use machine-learning and cross-validation to control for confounding and reduce bias; these features are particularly important because we are not able to randomize the cannabis use exposure and must control for selection factors. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that increased cannabis use during AUD treatment predicts increased drinking and related problems post- treatment compared to decreased cannabis use. We further hypothesize that high baseline alcohol use severity and low baseline social support worsen the negative effects of cannabis use on alcohol outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize that the effects of cannabis on alcohol use are mediated by increases in alcohol cravings. Innovation: This study will be the first to 1) quantify the long-term effects of cannabis use among individuals in treatment for AUD; 2) examine moderators of the effects of cannabis use on alcohol-related outcomes in individuals in treatment for AUD; and 3) assess mechanisms by which cannabis use affects alcohol-related outcomes in these individuals. Results will inform the clinical ambiguity regarding cannabis use and treatment for AUD, which is particularly timely given that the recent decriminalization of cannabis in several US states may increase the frequency or severity of cannabis use in this population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study uses advanced statistical methods to better understand how cannabis use among individuals recovering from alcohol use disorders affects drinking after treatment. Results will help alcohol treatment providers better understand the risks associated with cannabis use for people of varying demographics and substance use histories.",How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes,9136032,R21AA023039,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Caffeine', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Documentation', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'alcohol related consequences', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'craving', 'demographics', 'design', 'drinking', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana decriminalization', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'psychosocial', 'trend']",NIAAA,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R21,2016,186326,0.15505454362136628
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics. This lapse risk prediction model will be integrated into an existing validated mHealth platform to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of continuing care services.","Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies",9121449,R01AA024391,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Distal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Heart Rate', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychopathology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Support System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'coping', 'cost', 'craving', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'model development', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'real time model', 'relapse patients', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'stressor']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,381816,0.09498747623593017
"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9057931,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Applied Skills', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disease classification', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'global health', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2016,138174,0.0985288911033748
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The magnitude and cost of alcohol and other drug (AOD) related problems originating in adolescence make it especially vital to monitor these behaviors, identify high-risk groups and evaluate preventive interventions such as policy measures. Adolescent substance use is associated with the four leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this age group and results in more than $25 billion in direct costs due to medical care and lost time at work annually. Denominator-based health surveillance systems provide population-representative structured data to inform policy and guide clinical and research objectives to address this problem. However, survey timeframes and sampling frames do not support real-time monitoring, robust subgroup investigation, flexible follow up or feedback of health alerts and information to subjects. Harnessing youth engagement with online social media to derive timely information about alcohol use behaviors and problems may accelerate public health awareness and drive targeted responses. The purpose of our project is to develop a new approach to public health surveillance of underage drinking that centers on mining social media communications in Facebook. The approach may: fill gaps in knowledge about risky, stigmatizing or sensitive behaviors; describe subgroups of youth who may not have opportunity/willingness to report about risk behaviors to public health authorities or clinicians; accelerate detection of trends to ""real time""; and, enable evaluation of policy interventions to resolve impacts at greater temporal-social-geographic levels. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 - Derive metrics of underage alcohol consumption from user-generated Facebook data, testing correspondence of social media and traditional surveillance reports at the state level. The approach is to collect text reports from the public profiles of US Facebook users ages 13-20 years, creating alcohol use metrics from these data by parsing, filtering and classifying them using machine learning techniques. The main hypotheses are that (1.a) patterns of underage drinking derived from social media will correlate with traditional surveillance reports and (1.b) vary in relation to seasons/events. Aim 2 - Establish the relationship between validated measures of the alcohol policy environment and measures of youth alcohol consumption obtained from social media. The approach is to ascertain associations among extant, validated alcohol policy scores measured at the state level and social media sourced measures of underage drinking and harms (from Aim 1). The main hypothesis is that social media metrics of underage alcohol use will be associated with alcohol policy at the state level. By utilizing the expertise of an experienced multidisciplinary team and a comprehensive rigorous approach, we anticipate findings that will advance public health methods for monitoring underage drinking and harms and generate a paradigm shift for policy evaluation by enabling real-time investigation of impacts at fine temporal- spatial resolution. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The magnitude of alcohol problems originating in adolescence make it one of the greatest and costliest health problems for this age group. In this work, we will derive and validate metrics of alcohol consumption from information posted on Facebook by underage youth from all 50 US states, and establish the relationship between these social media sourced metrics and surrounding state alcohol policies. Findings will enable a new approach to population surveillance of underage drinking that will complement traditional systems.",Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media,9069662,R21AA023901,"['Absenteeism at work', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Americas', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drug usage', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Federal Government', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Household', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Local Government', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'State Government', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'age group', 'alcohol and other drug', 'authority', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'drinking', 'environmental intervention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'primary outcome', 'public policy on alcohol', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'temporal measurement', 'trend', 'underage drinking', 'willingness']",NIAAA,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2016,210188,0.06029573836121454
"Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive drinking in adolescence disrupts healthy development and leads to adverse social, economic and health consequences later in life. Although existing research focuses primarily on individual-level causes, neighborhood context is increasingly recognized as an upstream determinant of alcohol use. Yet since most prior neighborhood research on health has not been experimental, it is potentially biased, and weakens the foundation for policy translation. Our study proposes a secondary analysis of newly-available data from a social experiment of voluntary neighborhood relocation using housing vouchers in 5 cities (the Moving to Opportunity, MTO, Study), to test whether, how, and why random assignment of an offer to move to a low- poverty neighborhood over a 15 year period influenced the alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence of adolescents and their mothers. We will complement existing data with additional neighborhood- level data to enrich the dataset and test multilevel hypotheses. MTO is the only available large-scale study that has randomly assigned families to receive different neighborhood housing contexts, to support strong causal inferences of how early-life neighborhood context shapes alcohol use. When launched, MTO was one of the most promising policies to reverse the damaging effects of neighborhood poverty for minority families. But health researchers have had limited access to MTO data, compromising the scientific payoff of the $70+ million investment. Since residential mobility experiments like MTO are rare, expensive, and since MTO profoundly affected substance use, it is crucial to probe its effects. We propose new secondary data analyses with newly available 15 year follow-up data from this RCT, using novel methods to test mediation and moderation, applied to alcohol outcome measures that have not been examined prior. We apply innovative methods for assessing mediation (i.e., weight-based causal methods) and effect modification (i.e., machine learning techniques). Aside from the RCT design for strong causal inference of how early-life neighborhood changes influence excessive drinking, we also leverage one of the few longitudinal intervention designs sampling both mothers and their children, to illuminate familial transmission of drinking as it emerges in adolescence. Our R21 project builds on a productive, interdisciplinary team, experienced with the MTO study, and proposes 3 aims: to test how moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in the MTO experiment influenced excessive drinking and alcohol dependence; to examine if the MTO experimental effect on excessive drinking and alcohol dependence was less beneficial for more vulnerable families; to test whether effects of moving to a low-poverty neighborhood in MTO for excessive drinking and alcohol dependence were mediated by individual-level stress; family-level context; or neighborhood-level stress, alcohol availability, or alcohol norms. The results will enrich our understanding of neighborhood and family context as a cause of excessive drinking and alcohol use in adolescents and adults, and inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    This project will test mediation and moderation of a social experiment of housing and neighborhood relocation on alcohol use, excessive drinking, and alcohol dependence, among adolescents and their mothers, to probe whether, why, and among whom neighborhood context earlier in life is a cause of alcohol use across 15 years. This knowledge will inform the next generation of alcohol prevention policies. Because of its experimental design, results will inform causal pathways and potential intervention points, including during childhood, by which to reduce the population burden of alcohol use.                ",Mediators and Moderators of a Neighborhood Experiment on Alcohol Use,9015709,R21AA024530,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cities', 'Complement', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Household Heads', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Male Adolescents', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mothers', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Poverty', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residential Mobility', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Son', 'Stress', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'Victimization', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Youth', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol prevention', 'base', 'boys', 'contextual factors', 'density of AOD outlets', 'design', 'drinking', 'excessive drinking in adolescence', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'girls', 'health economics', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'next generation', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'social', 'therapy design', 'transmission process', 'underage drinking', 'volunteer', 'voucher']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R21,2016,233407,0.12071408959502618
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9161317,K25AA025095,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'New South Wales', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Siblings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'family structure', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'risk sharing', 'statistics', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2016,161460,0.1475075889190427
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control.

"The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the contribution of the OHSU site to the data collection efforts of the consortium entitled, Tracking Ethanol's Effects on Neurodevelopment (TEEN), and the specific focus of the OHSU site on examining how alcohol impacts functional connectivity in the developing brain and whether connectivity patterns can be used to predict risk for alcoholism. It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation. More recently, it has become appreciated that functional network dynamics of the brain, subserving these improvements, also dramatically change over the adolescent years. This period of heightened plasticity coincides with greater vulnerability to neurotoxic alcohol effects, such that heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in disruption to normally occurring maturation of neural circuitry. To examine this question, the approach of the TEEN consortium will be to disproportionately recruit individuals who are at elevated risk for alcohol use, based on personality features. This approach was chosen to ensure sufficient numbers of individuals who will transition from no use to use within the duration of this project, and also ensures sufficient numbers of individuals who are already drinking thereby enabling cross-sectional comparisons to complement the longitudinal studies. Using a sequential cohort design, the TEEN consortium will recruit 750 youth, stratified across three age-ranges: 12-15 years, 15-18 years, and 18-21 years, with each site recruiting and following 150 youth. A standardized set of neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical assessments will be included and administered at baseline and at three one-year follow-ups. The major aims of the OHSU site proposal are toward understanding the influence of alcohol on adolescent brain circuitry and at delineating risk-related abnormalities in developing adolescent brain networks using multi-modal integration. Understanding the neural phenotypes associated with increased risk for alcoholism and the potentially deleterious impact of alcohol on the neural connections in the adolescent brain could aid in the development of targeted strategies aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol drinking behaviors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to investigate the effect of adolescent drinking on the functional connectivity of the brain and determine whether patterns of connectivity can predict risk for heavy alcohol consumption.

"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Understanding sex-specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence is a crucial step toward developing more informed prevention and treatment strategies.                ",Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence,9056323,R01AA017664,"['16 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Estradiol', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Glare', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Functioning', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'heavy drinking during adolescence', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'personalized intervention', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,441285,0.15686126774775533
"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development,9064026,R01AA022493,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male Adolescents', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spin Labels', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Task Performances', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Visit', 'adolescent alcohol', 'adolescent brain development', 'adolescent substance abuse', 'age related', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'design', 'early alcohol use', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'pediatrician', 'practice-based research network', 'reduce adolescent alcohol', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'spatial memory', 'underage drinking', 'way finding', 'white matter']",NIAAA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2016,561937,0.14091957050061044
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV – Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),9205450,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'clinical care', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2016,396390,0.11742113533138542
"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM). Therefore, these studies provide an opportunity to have a dramatic and immediate impact on our ability to address the unmet medical needs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.",A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse,8867957,R01AA021661,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'FDA approved', 'Finland', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Institutes', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Welfare', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Typology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'alcohol research', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'forest', 'hazardous drinking', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'named group', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'tool']",NIAAA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2015,333922,0.08695721096505205
"Dynamic, real-time prediction of alcohol use lapse using mHealth technologies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Available psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for alcohol use disorder are effective at establishing abstinence. However, the vast majority of patients relapse within a year and often within the first few months following treatment. Patients often fail to detect dynamic changes in their relapse risk. Furthermore, the majority of patients fail to adequately sustain use of skills developed during treatment and/or through continuing care. Well-established theoretical models indicate that alcohol and other drug use lapse risk is a dynamic, non-linear function of both distal, relatively static, patient characteristics and often moment-by- moment dynamic changes in proximal, precipitating risk factors. However, comprehensive, precise assessment of dynamic risk indicators in real-time has not been possible until very recently. Furthermore, innovative methods from predictive analytics have not been applied to the lapse risk prediction problem. The broad goals of this project are to develop, validate, preliminarily optimize, and deliver a dynamic, real-time lapse risk prediction model for forecasting alcohol use among abstinent alcoholics. To pursue these goals, we propose to follow 200 patients for three months during or following completion of standard of care treatment for alcohol use disorder. We will measure well-established distal, static relapse risk indicators on study intake. More importantly, we will use innovative mHealth technology to densely sample dynamic risk indicators including patient physiology, subjective experience, and behavior daily for three months using smartphones and wearable biometric sensors. Data obtained for these static and dynamic risk indicators will provide the foundation to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1. Assess burden (feasibility, cost, and patient acceptability) to collect innovative, densely sampled risk indicators via smartphone and wearable sensors. 2. Use machine learning methods to develop, train, and validate a real-time quantitative lapse risk prediction signal based on static and dynamic risk indicators. 3. Use innovative Markov decision process models to optimize decisions about if, when, and how to provide additional treatment or support. 4. Integrate and deliver risk prediction and decision model within the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System for Addiction (A-CHESS) program. These project aims position A-CHESS to make relapse prevention and recovery support, information, and risk monitoring available to patients continuously. Compared to conventional continuing care, A-CHESS will provide personalized care and be available and implemented during moments of greatest need. Integrated real-time risk prediction holds substantial promise to encourage sustained recovery through adaptive use of these continuing care services.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goals of this project are to develop and deliver a dynamic, real-time model for forecasting alcohol use lapse among abstinent alcoholics.

"How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""How cannabis use affects alcohol treatment outcomes"" Introduction: While some suggest that cannabis use is related to increase drinking among individuals with alcohol use disorders (AUD), others have found that cannabis may substitute for alcohol and therefore reduce alcohol consumption among these individuals. However, no study has prospectively examined whether cannabis use is associated with increases or decreases in alcohol use in individuals in treatment for AUD. Primary aims: The primary aims of this study are to examine the effects of changes in cannabis use (i.e., increased vs. decreased use) during AUD treatment on post-treatment (immediately after treatment; one year, three years post-treatment) alcohol use and related problems. We will also investigate potential moderators (e.g., baseline dependence severity, social support) and mediators (e.g., alcohol cravings) of the relationship between cannabis use and AUD treatment outcomes. Preliminary analyses will also examine differences between those who use vs. do not use cannabis. Design: The proposed study is a secondary analysis of the two largest AUD treatment studies undertaken in the United States: the COMBINE Study and Project MATCH. Methods: Our sample consists of individuals with AUD who use cannabis but are not polysubstance dependent. Analyses will employ novel, highly sophisticated statistical methods, including Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) and Super Learner. TMLE and Super Learner use machine-learning and cross-validation to control for confounding and reduce bias; these features are particularly important because we are not able to randomize the cannabis use exposure and must control for selection factors. Hypotheses: We hypothesize that increased cannabis use during AUD treatment predicts increased drinking and related problems post- treatment compared to decreased cannabis use. We further hypothesize that high baseline alcohol use severity and low baseline social support worsen the negative effects of cannabis use on alcohol outcomes. Finally, we hypothesize that the effects of cannabis on alcohol use are mediated by increases in alcohol cravings. Innovation: This study will be the first to 1) quantify the long-term effects of cannabis use among individuals in treatment for AUD; 2) examine moderators of the effects of cannabis use on alcohol-related outcomes in individuals in treatment for AUD; and 3) assess mechanisms by which cannabis use affects alcohol-related outcomes in these individuals. Results will inform the clinical ambiguity regarding cannabis use and treatment for AUD, which is particularly timely given that the recent decriminalization of cannabis in several US states may increase the frequency or severity of cannabis use in this population.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study uses advanced statistical methods to better understand how cannabis use among individuals recovering from alcohol use disorders affects drinking after treatment. Results will help alcohol treatment providers better understand the risks associated with cannabis use for people of varying demographics and substance use histories.                ",How Cannabis Use Affects Alcohol Treatment Outcomes,8822758,R21AA023039,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Caffeine', 'Cannabis', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dependence', 'Documentation', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Geographic state', 'Health Personnel', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nicotine', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Qualifying', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Validation', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'alcohol related consequences', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'craving', 'demographics', 'design', 'drinking', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana decriminalization', 'marijuana use', 'marijuana user', 'novel', 'policy implication', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'trend']",NIAAA,PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE,R21,2015,148642,0.15505454362136628
"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.            ",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,8863672,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disease classification', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'global health', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'technology development', 'text searching', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2015,142637,0.0985288911033748
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naïve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The magnitude and cost of alcohol and other drug (AOD) related problems originating in adolescence make it especially vital to monitor these behaviors, identify high-risk groups and evaluate preventive interventions such as policy measures. Adolescent substance use is associated with the four leading causes of morbidity and mortality in this age group and results in more than $25 billion in direct costs due to medical care and lost time at work annually. Denominator-based health surveillance systems provide population-representative structured data to inform policy and guide clinical and research objectives to address this problem. However, survey timeframes and sampling frames do not support real-time monitoring, robust subgroup investigation, flexible follow up or feedback of health alerts and information to subjects. Harnessing youth engagement with online social media to derive timely information about alcohol use behaviors and problems may accelerate public health awareness and drive targeted responses. The purpose of our project is to develop a new approach to public health surveillance of underage drinking that centers on mining social media communications in Facebook. The approach may: fill gaps in knowledge about risky, stigmatizing or sensitive behaviors; describe subgroups of youth who may not have opportunity/willingness to report about risk behaviors to public health authorities or clinicians; accelerate detection of trends to ""real time""; and, enable evaluation of policy interventions to resolve impacts at greater temporal-social-geographic levels. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 - Derive metrics of underage alcohol consumption from user-generated Facebook data, testing correspondence of social media and traditional surveillance reports at the state level. The approach is to collect text reports from the public profiles of US Facebook users ages 13-20 years, creating alcohol use metrics from these data by parsing, filtering and classifying them using machine learning techniques. The main hypotheses are that (1.a) patterns of underage drinking derived from social media will correlate with traditional surveillance reports and (1.b) vary in relation to seasons/events. Aim 2 - Establish the relationship between validated measures of the alcohol policy environment and measures of youth alcohol consumption obtained from social media. The approach is to ascertain associations among extant, validated alcohol policy scores measured at the state level and social media sourced measures of underage drinking and harms (from Aim 1). The main hypothesis is that social media metrics of underage alcohol use will be associated with alcohol policy at the state level. By utilizing the expertise of an experienced multidisciplinary team and a comprehensive rigorous approach, we anticipate findings that will advance public health methods for monitoring underage drinking and harms and generate a paradigm shift for policy evaluation by enabling real-time investigation of impacts at fine temporal- spatial resolution.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The magnitude of alcohol problems originating in adolescence make it one of the greatest and costliest health problems for this age group. In this work, we will derive and validate metrics of alcohol consumption from information posted on Facebook by underage youth from all 50 US states, and establish the relationship between these social media sourced metrics and surrounding state alcohol policies. Findings will enable a new approach to population surveillance of underage drinking that will complement traditional systems.                ",Detecting Youth Drinking and Associations with Alcohol Policies via Social Media,8870480,R21AA023901,"['Absenteeism at work', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Americas', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Communications Media', 'Complement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Direct Costs', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Drug usage', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Federal Government', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Household', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Local Government', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Seasons', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'State Government', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'age group', 'alcohol and other drug', 'authority', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'digital', 'drinking', 'environmental intervention', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'primary outcome', 'public health relevance', 'public policy on alcohol', 'response', 'social', 'temporal measurement', 'trend', 'underage drinking', 'willingness']",NIAAA,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2015,254198,0.06029573836121454
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the contribution of the OHSU site to the data collection efforts of the consortium entitled, Tracking Ethanol's Effects on Neurodevelopment (TEEN), and the specific focus of the OHSU site on examining how alcohol impacts functional connectivity in the developing brain and whether connectivity patterns can be used to predict risk for alcoholism. It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation. More recently, it has become appreciated that functional network dynamics of the brain, subserving these improvements, also dramatically change over the adolescent years. This period of heightened plasticity coincides with greater vulnerability to neurotoxic alcohol effects, such that heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in disruption to normally occurring maturation of neural circuitry. To examine this question, the approach of the TEEN consortium will be to disproportionately recruit individuals who are at elevated risk for alcohol use, based on personality features. This approach was chosen to ensure sufficient numbers of individuals who will transition from no use to use within the duration of this project, and also ensures sufficient numbers of individuals who are already drinking thereby enabling cross-sectional comparisons to complement the longitudinal studies. Using a sequential cohort design, the TEEN consortium will recruit 750 youth, stratified across three age-ranges: 12-15 years, 15-18 years, and 18-21 years, with each site recruiting and following 150 youth. A standardized set of neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical assessments will be included and administered at baseline and at three one-year follow-ups. The major aims of the OHSU site proposal are toward understanding the influence of alcohol on adolescent brain circuitry and at delineating risk-related abnormalities in developing adolescent brain networks using multi-modal integration. Understanding the neural phenotypes associated with increased risk for alcoholism and the potentially deleterious impact of alcohol on the neural connections in the adolescent brain could aid in the development of targeted strategies aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol drinking behaviors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to investigate the effect of adolescent drinking on the functional connectivity of the brain and determine whether patterns of connectivity can predict risk for heavy alcohol consumption.

"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development,8921111,R01AA022493,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male Adolescents', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spin Labels', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Task Performances', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Visit', 'adolescent alcohol', 'adolescent brain development', 'adolescent substance abuse', 'age related', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'design', 'early alcohol use', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'male', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'pediatrician', 'practice-based research network', 'reduce adolescent alcohol', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'spatial memory', 'underage drinking', 'way finding', 'white matter']",NIAAA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2015,501515,0.14091957050061044
"A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse and alcoholism remain significant societal problems. Unfortunately, treatment for and monitoring of harmful alcohol consumption is hampered by the lack of a highly accurate diagnostic test of alcohol drinking behavior. Our long-term goal for this research project is to develop biomarkers of alcohol abuse for use in at- risk populations. In particular, we have identified highly sensitive and specific plasma protein biomarkers using a well-controlled nonhuman primate model of alcohol abuse. We propose, in this application to translate these findings from the nonhuman primate into potential diagnostic tools for monitoring alcohol abuse in humans. This will be undertaken in collaboration with three clinical sites around the world. Specifically, we will obtain de- identified clinical samples from he Coatesville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Yale University School of Medicine, and the Institute for Health and Welfare of Finland (Helsinki, Finland). Studies associated with this research program will be divided into two specific aims. Specific aim 1 will validate a novel plasma biomarker panel in recovering alcoholics. In this aim, our clinical collaborators (from Yale and the Coatesville VAMC) will provide anonymous, within-subject longitudinal samples from subjects undergoing withdrawal and early abstinence (21 to 28 days) from abusive drinking as well as from the general population. These well-annotated samples will be used to refine the list of 27 biomarkers to identify the set that is most diagnostic of the human drinking phenotype and withdrawal/ abstinence. These experiments will employ a multiplex quantitative solution-phase immunoassay designed for human analytes (Myriad RBM DiscoveryMAP v1.0). As with all biomarker discovery projects, our primary emphasis will be on identifying a plasma protein analyte panel with high sensitivity and specificity. Specific aim 2 will then refine the plasma biomarker panel to permit diagnosis of hazardous drinking in a cross-sectional population from multiple sites. Within- subject assessment of drinking behavior (Aim #1) is much easier because the test does not compare differing baseline physiologies. Requirements for general population screening are much more stringent and will be assessed in samples from three independent sites (Yale University, Coatesville PA Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Finland National Institute for Health and Welfare). These sites provide a rich number of samples and drinking behaviors from which to draw experimental cohorts. In summary, we believe this work is innovative in that it capitalizes on new concepts in biomarker development through the identification of novel targets. The specific aims will build on preceding successes in the nonhuman primate model by characterization of human samples. All of the proposed studies will involve correlation with normal clinical and psychosocial assessments of alcohol consumption (AUDIT self-reports;  percentCDT, AST/ALT, GGT, etc.). In addition, because we are not using unitary biomarker measures, we will apply sophisticated biostatistical approaches (random forest, support vector machine, principle component analysis) to the data analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A shortcoming of current approaches to diagnosing and treating alcohol abuse and alcoholism is that we have no reliable, objective clinical markers of drinking behavior. We have identified and patented a panel of plasma proteins that accurately classify alcohol consumption levels in non-human primates and have also identified alcohol-induced changes in the plasma proteome common to both non-human primates and humans in a published pilot clinical study. The proposed project will translate these important findings into a refined human diagnostic in collaboration with an FDA-approved clinical partner (Myriad RBM). Therefore, these studies provide an opportunity to have a dramatic and immediate impact on our ability to address the unmet medical needs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism.                ",A diagnostic plasma protein panel for alcohol abuse,8531534,R01AA021661,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'FDA approved', 'Finland', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Institutes', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Psychosocial Assessment and Care', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Social Welfare', 'Solutions', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Typology', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'alcohol research', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'forest', 'hazardous drinking', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'named group', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'screening', 'success', 'tool']",NIAAA,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2014,344250,0.08695721096505205
"Ambulatory assessment of alcohol use, mood dysregulation, and alcohol craving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive alcohol use has many negative health consequences, including higher risk of mortality. In addition, in 2006, the estimated economic cost of excessive drinking was $223.5 billion when the combined costs of lost productivity, health and health care, and crime are considered61. Despite unparalleled advances in technology over the last several decades, the clinical assessment of features and correlates of alcohol use disorders (and psychopathology more generally), still primarily relies on traditional paper-and-pencil questionnaires and face-to- face clinical interviews. However, these tried-and-true methods are limited in a number of ways, including total reliance on patients' retrospective self-report, the skill of the clinical interviewer, and the artificial setting of the assessment (te clinic consulting room). The present study proposes to use an innovative methodology, ambulatory assessment (AA) to describe and investigate alcohol use and dependence-related symptomatology (specifically, cue- reactivity/craving), and emotional dysregulation among psychiatric outpatients with disorders characterized by clinical significant emotional dysregulation problems (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or borderline personality disorder) while in their natural environment. This ""real-world"" approach can shed light on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.

"The TEEN Study: The Impact of Adolescent Drinking on Connectivity in the Brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application describes the contribution of the OHSU site to the data collection efforts of the consortium entitled, Tracking Ethanol's Effects on Neurodevelopment (TEEN), and the specific focus of the OHSU site on examining how alcohol impacts functional connectivity in the developing brain and whether connectivity patterns can be used to predict risk for alcoholism. It is well-established that adolescence is a time of dramatic maturation in the brain, paralleled by improvements in executive abilities, social functioning, and emotional regulation. More recently, it has become appreciated that functional network dynamics of the brain, subserving these improvements, also dramatically change over the adolescent years. This period of heightened plasticity coincides with greater vulnerability to neurotoxic alcohol effects, such that heavy alcohol exposure during adolescence may result in disruption to normally occurring maturation of neural circuitry. To examine this question, the approach of the TEEN consortium will be to disproportionately recruit individuals who are at elevated risk for alcohol use, based on personality features. This approach was chosen to ensure sufficient numbers of individuals who will transition from no use to use within the duration of this project, and also ensures sufficient numbers of individuals who are already drinking thereby enabling cross-sectional comparisons to complement the longitudinal studies. Using a sequential cohort design, the TEEN consortium will recruit 750 youth, stratified across three age-ranges: 12-15 years, 15-18 years, and 18-21 years, with each site recruiting and following 150 youth. A standardized set of neuroimaging, cognitive, and clinical assessments will be included and administered at baseline and at three one-year follow-ups. The major aims of the OHSU site proposal are toward understanding the influence of alcohol on adolescent brain circuitry and at delineating risk-related abnormalities in developing adolescent brain networks using multi-modal integration. Understanding the neural phenotypes associated with increased risk for alcoholism and the potentially deleterious impact of alcohol on the neural connections in the adolescent brain could aid in the development of targeted strategies aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol drinking behaviors.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to investigate the effect of adolescent drinking on the functional connectivity of the brain and determine whether patterns of connectivity can predict risk for heavy alcohol consumption.

"Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised R01 A1 proposal (AA022493), ""Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development"", responds to the need to understand the impact of initiating alcohol consumption on adolescent brain maturation. We have teamed with the Center for Adolescent Substance Abuse Research (CeASAR) and Boston Children's Hospital to implement an innovative strategy that combines multiple neuroimaging and neuropsychological approaches to identify neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities associated with early and escalating alcohol use during adolescence. Adolescents will be recruited from general pediatrician offices and adolescent medicine clinics comprising the New England Partnership for Substance Abuse Research (NEPSAR), a practice-based research network of primary care offices. Adolescents will be enrolled into the study prior to the initiation of alcoho use or other drug use, and examined longitudinally, at baseline (13-14 yrs old) and again at two annual follow-up visits. To provide a comprehensive longitudinal profile of brain function, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and task and resting state blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be paired with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA and glutamate levels in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and medial temporal lobe (MTL, containing hippocampus). In addition, arterial spin labeling (ASL) will be used to measure quantitative perfusion, which will be used to calibrate the magnitude of BOLD fMRI signal changes during response inhibition and spatial memory fMRI tasks. Magnetic resonance measures will be integrated with measures from clinical assessments and an extensive neuropsychological battery, designed to detect and further characterize developmental changes and the influence of adolescent alcohol use. The incorporation of complementary multi-modal measures of brain function and neuroplasticity could offer valuable insight into the dynamic processes of brain maturation and help identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use, which will provide a foundation for informing prevention and intervention efforts aimed at reducing adolescent alcohol consumption.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This longitudinal, multi-modal study of adolescents during the critical period of brain maturation, and during a time that overlaps with the onset of alcohol initiation, will help elucidate milestones of healthy adolescent brain development and identify neural signatures associated with the onset and escalation of alcohol use.                ",Consequences of Adolescent Alcohol Use on Brain Development,8723602,R01AA022493,"['Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anisotropy', 'Anterior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Boston', 'Brain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Enrollment', 'Failure', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male Adolescents', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spin Labels', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Task Performances', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Visit', 'adolescent alcohol', 'adolescent substance abuse', 'age related', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cingulate cortex', 'critical period', 'design', 'early alcohol use', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'male', 'myelination', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychological', 'pediatrician', 'practice-based research network', 'public health relevance', 'reduce adolescent alcohol', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'underage drinking', 'way finding', 'white matter']",NIAAA,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2014,547701,0.14091957050061044
"Ambulatory assessment of alcohol use, mood dysregulation, and alcohol craving     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Excessive alcohol use has many negative health consequences, including higher risk of mortality. In addition, in 2006, the estimated economic cost of excessive drinking was $223.5 billion when the combined costs of lost productivity, health and health care, and crime are considered61. Despite unparalleled advances in technology over the last several decades, the clinical assessment of features and correlates of alcohol use disorders (and psychopathology more generally), still primarily relies on traditional paper-and-pencil questionnaires and face-to- face clinical interviews. However, these tried-and-true methods are limited in a number of ways, including total reliance on patients' retrospective self-report, the skill of the clinical interviewer, and the artificial setting of the assessment (te clinic consulting room). The present study proposes to use an innovative methodology, ambulatory assessment (AA) to describe and investigate alcohol use and dependence-related symptomatology (specifically, cue- reactivity/craving), and emotional dysregulation among psychiatric outpatients with disorders characterized by clinical significant emotional dysregulation problems (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or borderline personality disorder) while in their natural environment. This ""real-world"" approach can shed light on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Excessive alcohol use is a major public health problem and incurs enormous costs to our society. By studying the subjective and physiological correlates of alcohol use, emotional dysregulation, and alcohol craving, this study will improve the conceptualization and assessment of alcohol use disorder (AUD), facilitate research on the causes and correlates of alcohol dependence, and suggest improvements in treatment approaches.                 ","Ambulatory assessment of alcohol use, mood dysregulation, and alcohol craving",8485376,R21AA022099,"['Affective', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Skills', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Glosso-Sterandryl', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Interviewer', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Network-based', 'Outpatients', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reliance', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Respiration', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Video Recording', 'Wireless Technology', 'alcohol craving', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'data exchange', 'design', 'diaries', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'negative mood', 'positive mood', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sensor']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R21,2013,207312,0.13931070021973427

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving  Project Summary Abstract This proposal aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effets of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this proposal will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.

"Pathway-based analysis of addiction susceptibility genes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Susceptibility to alcohol and substance dependence is known to be influenced by genetic factors. However, few specific genetic variations that alter susceptibility to addiction have been identified. This is partly because addiction is a polygenic trait, influenced by many genetic variations, each with a small marginal effect. Phenotypic characteristics are controlled by networks of interacting biochemical and physiological pathways influenced by the products of specific genes. While single genetic variants result in small changes in susceptibility to complex diseases, it is the combined effects of genes within a biochemical pathway that likely drive phenotype expression.  The research proposed in this application aims to apply novel pathway-based methods to analyze existing data from a genome wide association study of alcoholism. Case-control alcohol dependence data from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), collected by Dr. Laura Bierut and colleagues, will be analyzed. The methods that will be applied take into account known relationships between genes and their products and assess the effect of gene-sets that represent biological pathways, rather than assessing individual gene effects. Once significant pathways are identified, comprehensive analyses of genes within these pathways will be performed, to characterize the genetic effects, including interactions between genetic variations. These analyses will utilize random forest methods and LASSO logistic regression with gene-gene interaction effects.  The long term goals of this research are to improve the detection of interacting genetic risk factors for substance addiction and subtypes of substance use disorders, by applying optimal statistical techniques. While studying all possible interactions between SNPs from a genome-wide scan may not be practical, a focused approach of investigating genetic interactions within a relevant pathway is expected to be more powerful and yield interpretable results.  Analysis of existing data using new statistical methods that account for the relationships between genes that act as part of common neural or molecular pathways has great potential to identify genetic variations that contribute to individual differences in addiction susceptibility. Discovery of such genetic risk factors has important implications including increasing our understanding of the pathways of development of addiction and risk prediction. Perhaps more importantly, this knowledge is expected to help identify subtypes of addiction that require different interventions leading to personalized treatment with increased success rates.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although progress has been made in terms of understanding the heritable aspects of alcoholism and other substance use disorders, few specific genetic risk factors have been identified.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effects of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding).

"Adolescent Psychopathology and Alcohol Use Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K02 competitive continuation application proposes to advance understanding of adolescent alcohol use disorders (AUDs) through examination of adult outcomes with innovative statistical techniques for longitudinal data. In Years 6 through 10, the program focus evolves from statistical techniques for categorical variables to techniques based on finite mixture models. The programmatic focus shifts from relationships among adolescent characteristics to adult outcomes. The project will emphasize person-centered statistical strategies to predict adult outcomes among adolescents characterized by substance involvement trajectories, psychopathology latent classes, childhood maltreatment histories, and treatment participation.      With NIAAA and NIDA support, the Pittsburgh Adolescent Alcohol Research Center (PAARC) is completing adult follow-up assessments in adolescents with AUDs and a reference group. The hypotheses consider the confluence of behavioral, cognitive, and affective dysregulation in predicting AUD course, complications, and outcomes. Adult outcomes examined include AUDs, other substance use disorders, psychopathology,) personality disorders, academic achievement, work performance, family status, somatic symptoms, liver injury, and sexually transmitted diseases. Complementary data from the Center for Education and Drug Abuse Research (NIDA P50: PI Tarter, Co-PI Clark), a study of children at risk for alcohol and drug use disorders followed through adolescence into adulthood, will also be utilized. Incorporating categorical variables pertinent to symptom and diagnostic categories, the statistical strategies applied will include multivariate survival analysis, general growth mixture models, and Bayesian instance-based machine learning.

The role of implicit expectancies in predicting drinking behavior, over and above explicit questionnaires, in a large (N = 400) community population will also be studied. Participants will complete a reaction time measure of their memory associations to alcohol, as well as other self-report measures of drinking, alcohol expectancies, personality, family history, etc., and a drinking history interview. Long-term data on drinking (3-month follow up) will also be collected. Data analysis will include artificial neural network modeling and multiple regression analyses.         n/a",Alcohol Use: Nonlinearities in Intraindividual Variables,6835341,F31AA015238,"['adult human (21+)', 'alcoholic beverage consumption', 'alcoholism /alcohol abuse', 'artificial intelligence', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'case history', 'clinical research', 'computer human interaction', 'expectancy', 'experience', 'human subject', 'interview', 'longitudinal human study', 'mathematical model', 'model design /development', 'personality', 'predoctoral investigator', 'questionnaires', 'reflex']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,F31,2004,33837,0.14971655611202583
"Adolescent Psychopathology and Alcohol Use Disorders DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This K02 competitive continuation application proposes to advance understanding of adolescent alcohol use disorders (AUDs) through examination of adult outcomes with innovative statistical techniques for longitudinal data. In Years 6 through 10, the program focus evolves from statistical techniques for categorical variables to techniques based on finite mixture models. The programmatic focus shifts from relationships among adolescent characteristics to adult outcomes. The project will emphasize person-centered statistical strategies to predict adult outcomes among adolescents characterized by substance involvement trajectories, psychopathology latent classes, childhood maltreatment histories, and treatment participation.      With NIAAA and NIDA support, the Pittsburgh Adolescent Alcohol Research Center (PAARC) is completing adult follow-up assessments in adolescents with AUDs and a reference group. The hypotheses consider the confluence of behavioral, cognitive, and affective dysregulation in predicting AUD course, complications, and outcomes. Adult outcomes examined include AUDs, other substance use disorders, psychopathology,) personality disorders, academic achievement, work performance, family status, somatic symptoms, liver injury, and sexually transmitted diseases. Complementary data from the Center for Education and Drug Abuse Research (NIDA P50: PI Tarter, Co-PI Clark), a study of children at risk for alcohol and drug use disorders followed through adolescence into adulthood, will also be utilized. Incorporating categorical variables pertinent to symptom and diagnostic categories, the statistical strategies applied will include multivariate survival analysis, general growth mixture models, and Bayesian instance-based machine learning. These methods will be specifically optimized to construct clinically relevant models applicable to individual patients, serving as the basis for more thorough phenotype description, more effective prevention programs, and individually tailored treatment interventions. n/a",Adolescent Psychopathology and Alcohol Use Disorders,6821042,K02AA000291,"['academic achievement', 'adolescence (12-20)', 'alcoholism /alcohol abuse', 'antisocial personality', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'child abuse', 'clinical research', 'conduct disorder', 'data collection methodology /evaluation', 'developmental psychology', 'functional ability', 'health surveys', 'human subject', 'longitudinal human study', 'major depression', 'mathematical model', 'mental disorder diagnosis', 'mental health epidemiology', 'model design /development', 'mood disorders', 'outcomes research', 'posttraumatic stress disorder', 'prognosis', 'psychopathology', 'sex abuse', 'social behavior', 'suicide']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K02,2004,127340,0.1438146292292875

"Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.  In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases  In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patient’s substance use treatment needs.  We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in hospitalized patients and guiding interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of the substance misuse classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test substance misuse classifier retrospectively and then examine its performance prospectively in both a naïve and mature screening program. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients,10026785,R01DA051464,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Felis catus', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Social Work', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Substance Abuse Detection', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comparison intervention', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening program', 'substance misuse', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,663889,0.07344914936609315
"ClientBot: A conversational agent that supports skills practice and feedback for Motivational Interviewing for AUD PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Millions of Americans are in need of evidence-based counseling, such as motivational interviewing (MI), for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) each year. To develop competence in an evidence-based practice like MI, trainees require ample opportunities for practice and immediate, performance-based feedback on the skills that they are learning. However, this is challenging if not impossible to offer at scale -- to the large number of providers in need of training. Opportunities for practice typically rely on roleplays with other trainees with limited experience, and feedback requires either direct supervision from an expert trainer or behavioral coding from a trained coding team; these are costly, limited, and time consuming. AI-based technology can meet this need, generating many opportunities for practice, and providing regular, actionable feedback. Many practice opportunities coupled with rapid, performance-based feedback can enhance and expand training in evidence-based counseling for AUDs in a scalable and cost-efficient manner.  Lyssn.io​, Inc., (“Lyssn”) is a start-up developing AI-based technologies to support training, supervision, and quality assurance of evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. ​Lyssn’s​ team includes expertise in natural language processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous research demonstrated the basic utility of a prototype conversational agent (ClientBot) for training counselors. Currently, ClientBot simulates a general mental health client who can engage in open-ended interaction with trainees and provides immediate, performance-based feedback to trainees using machine learning.  The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal partners ​Lyssn​ with Prevention Research Institute (PRI), who has a long track-record of training counselors in evidence-based approaches for AUD and currently trains approximately 1,250 counselors per year. Phase I will adapt ClientBot to an AUD training context, including understanding PRI training workflows, assessing usability, and accuracy of machine learning based MI feedback. Phase II will conduct a field-based usability trial and a randomized training trial (N = 200 PRI trainees) to evaluate the effectiveness of ClientBot on learning of MI skills compared to a wait-list and PRI training-as-usual. Analyses will also examine the hypothesized mechanisms of behavior change underlying ClientBot’s MI skills training. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on role plays with peers and human judgment for training and performance-based feedback and support commercialization of a ClientBot product for training of AUD counselors in evidence-based practices. PROJECT NARRATIVE Training counselors in evidence-based treatments for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) requires repeated opportunities for skills practice with performance-based feedback, which is challenging to provide at scale. Building on an existing prototype, ​Lyssn.io​ – a technology start-up focused on scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies – will enhance and evaluate an AI-based, conversational agent (ClientBot) that simulates a realistic client with alcohol concerns and provides performance-based feedback to support counselor training.",ClientBot: A conversational agent that supports skills practice and feedback for Motivational Interviewing for AUD,10009084,R44AA028463,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Music', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nonprofit Organizations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prevention Research', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Role', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Sports', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Vision', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'alcohol testing', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral health', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'peer', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIAAA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2020,397456,0.05543026399716502

"Leveraging electronic health records to identify risky alcohol use prior to surgery Project Summary/Abstract Patients who consume more than two drinks a day prior to elective surgery are at increased risk of experiencing a myriad of surgical complications, readmissions, and prolonged hospital stays. Fortunately, short-term pre-operative abstinence from alcohol mitigates many surgical risks, and carefully timed interventions can prevent complications and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, implementation of pre- operative alcohol interventions requires accurate identification of patients with risky alcohol use at least four weeks prior to surgery. Pre-operative clinics frequently fail to screen for alcohol use or do so too close to the surgery date to allow time for intervention. Electronic health records (EHRs) offer an unprecedented amount of accessible clinical data that can be leveraged to identify risky alcohol use early in the surgical episode of care. Innovative methods are needed to identify data elements and create algorithms to capture risky alcohol use from structured and unstructured EHR data. Natural language processing (NLP) and other machine learning (ML)-based approaches are best suited to extract and analyze alcohol-related clinical narratives, and to synthesize heterogeneous alcohol-related data through computer-assisted methods. The proposed study will leverage EHR data to identify and characterize risky alcohol use among surgical patients to identify cohorts who could benefit from pre-operative alcohol intervention. The study aims are to: 1) develop an electronic, automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using NLP and ML; 2) validate the algorithm through prospective data collection; and 3) longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use phenotypes and adverse surgical outcomes including complications and hospital readmissions. Innovative applications of NLP and ML will support evaluation of unstructured EHR data (e.g. clinical notes) and will enable integration of heterogeneous alcohol use data to create the computable phenotype. The aims will be achieved through collaboration of experts in key clinical domains and advanced methodologies. This study will create and validate the first alcohol-specific phenotype-based algorithm for surgical patients, which will support future clinical applications and research into alcohol-related surgical interventions and health outcomes. Study outcomes are expected to have immediate value for identifying cohorts for future implementation research and lead to a new clinical tool for surgical clinics. Project Narrative Risky alcohol use is one of the most common risk factors for surgical complications among elective surgical patients. This study will develop an automated computable phenotype to classify risky alcohol use prior to surgery using electronic health record data, and longitudinally evaluate the association between risky alcohol use and adverse surgical outcomes.

"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsor’s (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9988982,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical implementation', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'effectiveness implementation study', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'software infrastructure', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,562148,0.15080623718502606
"Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media Consumption of cancer causing products (CCPs) is the root cause of many of the cancers and chronic diseases we aim to cure with translational medicine. Tobacco and alcohol consumption is a function of highly successful, coordinated global business models that promote consumption. The marketing of CCPs can be seen as a disease vector that drives CCP consumption and worthy of surveillance. The present project addresses the marketing of tobacco and alcohol to young people in the current media environment, in which youths increasingly stream their entertainment in a relatively commercial free environment. To address decreasing reach of traditional advertising, companies have sought to embed their brands in the entertainment itself. Alcohol companies actively seek entertainment placement deals. While cigarette companies have agreed not to pay for product placement, they may evade current restrictions by burying placements in the massive streamed entertainment environment. E-cigarette companies have no such restrictions and advertise on television. Youths obtain exposure to brands that spend more on advertising (e.g., Budweiser); these are also the most commonly consumed brands by youth. Product placement exposures may put adolescents at greater risk for CCP consumption. This study represents the first step in assessing that risk--to obtain infoveillance on CCP brand prevalence in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 involves a partnership with machine learning researchers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to develop and validate a computer recognition system for major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brands in streamed entertainment media. Aim 1 relies on an existing, large Dartmouth media training library that includes detailed timing for tobacco and alcohol brands from over 2000 contemporary movies. JPL researchers will use the Dartmouth media library, combined with a large corpus of brand logos retrieved from the web, to train and validate an automated Video Content Coding (VCC) system that identifies content associated with key alcohol and tobacco brands. The VCC system will leverage recent techniques to construct robust object detection systems using Convolutional Neural Networks built on large image databases, along with text extraction methods to identify brand names in advertising logos. Second, we will deploy the automated recognition system on the Dartmouth computer cluster to assess the frequency of major cigarette, e-cigarette, and alcohol brand placements from a large sample of streamed/cable and movie entertainment. This proposal involves a unique multidisciplinary team of Dartmouth behavioral scientists and NASA machine learning scientists who will leverage new technologies to study a significant CCP marketing platform. The novel approach offers unprecedented opportunities to conduct surveillance on CCP marketing in large media samples. Our project will set the stage for future research on exposure to this type of marketing and its relation to CCP consumption in youths and lead to a better understanding of the risks CCP brand placements pose to health. Project Narrative This project addresses the potential exposure of youth to marketing of cancer causing products— tobacco and alcohol— in the popular commercial-free streaming environment, where products are embedded in the media itself through product placement. We will employ machine learning to develop an automated visual recognition system for major tobacco and alcohol brands and deploy that system to evaluate brand placement in a large sample of streamed entertainment from cable (e.g., HBO) and other (e.g., Netflix Originals) companies. This surveillance program will have the capability to monitor embedded marketing across many platforms and ultimately allow us to assess youth exposure to embedded brands and its relation with early onset of tobacco and alcohol use.",Machine Learning for Computerized Surveillance of Tobacco and Alcohol Brands in Streamed Entertainment Media,9928031,R01CA225845,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Beverages', 'Alcohols', 'Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Businesses', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cigarette', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Communication Methods', 'Communication Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Influenza', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Marketing', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Perception', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Smoking', 'Stream', 'Surveillance Program', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Surveillance', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration', 'Visual', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'computer cluster', 'computerized', 'convolutional neural network', 'drinking', 'early onset', 'handheld mobile device', 'innovation', 'movie', 'movie exposure', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'response', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco exposure', 'tobacco products', 'translational medicine']",NCI,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2020,518620,0.04330586127749458
"SERVICES FOR SYNTHESIZING INFORMATION TO SUPPORT TREATMENTS FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER In response to PHS 2020-1,Topic 019 entitled, “Data Science Tools for Accelerating Alcohol Research”, Netrias and the Waggoner Center for Alcohol and Addiction Research (WCAAR) propose to develop ASSIST, a data science platform that will use deep learning to aid alcohol researchers in the discovery of drug targets clinically linked to Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). ASSIST introduces a novel deep learning algorithm, the Deep Response Model, which is a data-driven approach to discover multi-target transcriptomic profiles clinically linked to AUD. These targets can then be used to identify new treatments that have the potential to reduce addiction to alcohol and prevent relapse. State-of-the-art bioinformatics techniques rely on enrichment analysis tools that utilize imprecise knowledgebases, curated from unrelated diseases and model systems, and only cover a fraction of genes for which annotation exists. This leads to a low success rate in the identification of targets clinically linked to AUD. Instead, ASSIST will take a data-driven approach to learn higher level mappings between genes and their impact on disease state directly from transcriptomic data. Netrias will develop computational tests that will measure the accuracy, robustness, and specificity of the discovered targets to AUD. ASSIST will then integrate with drug databases to identify treatments that will reverse the expression profiles of the discovered set of targets. n/a",SERVICES FOR SYNTHESIZING INFORMATION TO SUPPORT TREATMENTS FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDER,10272788,5N94020C00002,"['Alcohols', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Targeting', 'Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Services', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'knowledge base', 'novel', 'prevent', 'response', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NICHD,"NETRIAS, LLC",N43,2020,224865,0.08298988375650138
"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",10017030,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2020,191907,0.05744612025356995
"Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Risky drinking, such as binge (5+/4+ drinks per 2-hour occasion for males/females) and high-intensity (2-3x the rates of binge) drinking, is highly prevalent among young adults and associated with severe acute and longer-term negative behavioral and health outcomes. However, given its prevalence, individuals who engage in such activities comprise a heterogeneous group. Researchers have had a hard time identifying the varied behavioral processes that are predictive of negative alcohol-related consequences and problematic trajectories across time. Predicting who will go on to develop lasting problems and whose risky alcohol use behavior is developmentally-limited is especially challenging. Part of the hindrance comes from the methods that are currently used to study this diverse behavior. In particular, researchers often use cross-sectional studies to look across individuals. While this has reaped invaluable knowledge regarding differences among individuals in their drinking patterns, it does not reveal the dynamic processes that contribute to maintaining such behaviors or make one more likely to have negative consequences. However, increasingly hypotheses pertain to these dynamic processes. This requires arriving at quantitative descriptions of individuals' emotional and behavioral processes. The science can move towards a more nuanced understanding of the varied mechanisms contributing to problematic alcohol use by arriving at valid descriptions of individual-level (i.e., personalized) processes. We propose to make advances towards personalized quantitative models in four ways: 1) develop an informed intensive longitudinal research design that enables acquisition of relevant variables across time on a daily basis and across the span of one year; 2) use innovative measurement technologies that enable objective assessment of contextual features related to drinking; 3) collect data using state-of-the-art phone applications that enable self-report and passive data collection where the user does not need to interface; and 4) implement cutting- edge machine learning algorithms that can reliably arrive at individual-level detection and predictive models that can be used as the foundation for future just-in-time adaptive interventions. We will accomplish this by enrolling N=300 young adult risky drinkers who will complete a 120-day ambulatory assessment protocol completing surveys on smartphones that are also equipped with passive sensors and applications, and then provide 4 waves of data on alcohol use and associated variables (e.g., consequences) over one year. In the end, our endeavors will create novel approaches to measuring and modeling behavioral processes related to high-risk drinking that capture the individuality of each participant. These endeavors will provide the framework for accurate detection and prediction of daily drinking and long-term problematic alcohol use trajectories that support future scientific and clinical efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Risky drinking behavior (i.e., episodic binge and high-intensity drinking), which peaks in young adulthood, is estimated to account for more than 40,000 deaths annually and over $167 Billion in economic costs in the United States. Young adult risky drinkers are a heterogeneous group, which makes them very difficult to study and to predict who will go on to develop lasting problems with alcohol use and alcohol use disorder. This research will implement cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and apply them to data collected from daily surveys and passive smartphone sensors in young adult risky drinkers to develop personalized models of problematic alcohol use.",Using Smartphone Assessments for Personalized Prediction of Problematic Alcohol Use,9973396,R01AA026879,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Bluetooth', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Individuality', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motivation', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Models', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Vehicle crash', 'Violence', 'adaptive intervention', 'alcohol behavior', 'alcohol related consequences', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'bench to bedside', 'binge drinking', 'craving', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'economic cost', 'emotion regulation', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'social', 'social group', 'working group', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,606423,0.14044084530277876
"Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data Abstract Transdermal alcohol biosensors offer a promising method for unobtrusively collecting continuous alcohol levels in naturalistic settings over long periods of time. Devices are now available to reliably measure transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC), the amount of alcohol diffusing through the skin, but an often overlooked yet critical issue for making these biosensors valuable is that TAC does not consistently correlate with the easily interpretable measures of breath and blood alcohol concentrations (BrAC/BAC) across individuals, environmental conditions, and devices. The goal of this study is to produce software to convert TAC data into estimates of BrAC/BAC (eBrAC/eBAC). We will meet this goal by 1) developing mathematical models to produce quantitative eBrAC from TAC data, 2) examining alternative options for calibrating these models, 3) testing the model fits using varied types and amounts of very precise data, and 4) packaging the models into a comprehensive data assimilation software program. Specifically, we will enhance the fidelity of the models by integrating advanced physics/physiological-based models with statistical methods and data-driven machine- learning techniques. To reduce the burden currently required to calibrate the models for each individual, we will test a number of calibration procedures, including the replacement of the laboratory alcohol administration session with more varied drinking protocols as well as with population-based parameter estimates. We will test our models and protocols using detailed consumption data collected 1) on two of the investigators, 2) on 40 participants who will each participate in four controlled laboratory drinking sessions, and 3) on 40 participants who will each participate in a field trial and laboratory sessions. We will examine model fits across drinking patterns when using varying amounts of individualized alcohol data (e.g., breath analyzer, drink diary) to calibrate the models, and within and across individuals with differing characteristics (e.g., gender, weight) and under variable conditions (e.g., humidity, heart rate) that may affect model fit. We will create a data assimilation software system, the BrAC Estimator software, that incorporates all available data to produce the most accurate eBrAC measures. The software output will include the identification of drinking episodes, continuous eBrAC signal, and eBrAC summary scores (e.g., peak eBrAC, time of peak eBrAC, area under the drinking curve) with confidence bands. The software will be platform-portable to run alone or to be integrated into other mobile health technologies or precision medicine protocols. This proposal is innovative, technologically sophisticated, and feasible, and would result in the first tool to accomplish the TAC-eBrAC conversion, finally making it possible to obtain interpretable quantitative measurement of naturalistic alcohol consumption in the field. The anticipated result of this study is the expanded utility of TAC biosensors for researchers, clinicians, and individuals to monitor naturalistic alcohol consumption and easily understand the results. Narrative This research program will advance mathematical models and methodological techniques to make it possible to obtain quantitative estimates of breath and blood alcohol concentration levels from the data produced by transdermal alcohol sensors. By making these methodological advancements available in software programs for use by non-mathematicians, the proposed study has the capability of widely enhancing the alcohol research community’s ability to investigate a variety of alcohol-related research topics that cannot be captured retrospectively or in laboratory settings, including naturalistic patterns of consumption, individual differences in response to alcohol, real-time drinking behavior and decisions, clinical intervention outcomes, and the prevention and treatment of alcoholism. More broadly, the software can be integrated with personal health monitoring systems for general public use and provide easily interpreted personalized alcohol consumption feedback.",Estimating BrAC/BAC from Transdermal Alcohol: Combining First-Principles Physiological Models with Machine-Learning to Create Software to Optimally Process and Quantitatively Interpret Biosensor Data,9902264,R01AA026368,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assimilations', 'Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes', 'Biosensor', 'Blood alcohol level measurement', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Concentration measurement', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Feedback', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Rate', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Linear Models', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Weight', 'Work', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol response', 'alcoholism therapy', 'base', 'breath alcohol measurement', 'data reduction', 'diaries', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'physiologic model', 'population based', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'sensor', 'software systems', 'supervised learning', 'time interval', 'time use', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,500910,0.10549107362761181
"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nation’s health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the world’s largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",10001326,F31DA047048,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'support vector machine']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2020,36051,0.09655965157900373
"Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development Abstract Alcohol initiation at an early age is associated with numerous negative outcomes, including a significant increase in the risk of developing an alcohol-use disorder later in life. Vulnerability for early misuse and other problematic alcohol use behaviors have been linked to individual differences in brain function. However, few studies have sought to identify brain-based predictors (‘neuromarkers’) of alcohol use behaviors in youth. Identification of brain-based predictors of alcohol use behaviors in youth is essential for the development of more effective early prevention and intervention efforts. This proposal combines machine learning and longitudinal modeling approaches to 1) identify neural networks predictive of early alcohol initiation and misuse and 2) chart the developmental trajectories of these networks over time in a large sample of youth (N>3,000) using data from three unique, proprietary and completed datasets. Neural networks conferring vulnerability for alcohol use behaviors during adolescence will be identified using connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM). CPM is a machine-learning method of generating behavioral predictions from individual patterns of brain organization; i.e., functional connectivity matrices. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, CPM is entirely data-driven and requires no a priori selection of brain regions or networks. As such, CPM is both a predictive tool and a method of identifying networks that underlie specific behaviors; i.e., neuromarkers. CPM has been successfully used to predict complex behaviors including future abstinence and other addiction-relevant phenotypes. This proposal will use CPM to identify neuromarkers of alcohol initiation and predict transitions to risky drinking in youth (AIM 1). Quantification of changes in brain function, e.g., growth curve trajectory analysis, is central to the characterization of developmental phenomena. Analyses of developmental trajectories can be used to identify particularly sensitive growth periods, detect variations that may signal risk, define modifiable targets, and monitor the impact of environment and interventions on development. While extant data indicate alcohol-related alterations in neural development, very few studies have assessed interactions between neurodevelopmental trajectories over time and alcohol-use behaviors. Developmental trajectories of identified networks in relation to alcohol use behaviors over time will be assessed using multilevel modeling (AIM 2). This proposal represents the first attempt to identify neural networks predictive of alcohol-initiation and risky drinking using a wholly data- driven, machine learning approach in a large sample of youth and does so using existing data. This is a critical step toward identifying a reliable predictor of alcohol initiation in youth and will shed light on individual difference factors representing vulnerability for misuse. Such predictors are needed to understand the developmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes and to inform early risk models and preventative intervention efforts. Project Narrative: Alcohol is the most commonly used substance in youth, and earlier ages of alcohol initiation are associated with increased likelihoods of alcohol-use disorder later in life. This project will identify brain networks that predict alcohol initiation and misuse—and chart the developmental trajectories of those networks over time— using existing neuroimaging data from three unique longitudinal datasets (N>3,000). Identification of brain- based predictors of alcohol initiation and misuse will aid in the development of targeted prevention and intervention efforts to address alcohol problems in youth.",Connectome-based prediction and neurodevelopmental trajectories of alcohol phenotypes across development,9930509,R01AA027553,"['Abstinence', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Alcohol Phenotype', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'European', 'Female', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Names', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'alcohol use initiation', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'brain research', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'hazardous drinking', 'high risk', 'high risk drinking', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multilevel analysis', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'theories', 'time use', 'university student', 'young adult']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,417706,0.10656591685813079
"Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder ABSTRACT This application represents our ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of substance use disorders (SUDs). This research is achieved through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data that combine clinical symptoms and diagnoses, imaging markers, and genotypes. The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA “Leveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.” The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify and differentiate subtypes of alcohol and nicotine use disorders by combining neural markers, genotype data, and clinical diagnostic information. The proposed analytics will be tested in a large database of alcohol and nicotine use disorders from the UK Biobank project. The proposed approaches will advance precision medicine by refining disease classification and facilitating gene finding for addictive and other mental disorders.",Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder,10056455,R01DA051922,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine Use Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'biobank', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cocaine use', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'data structure', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neural correlate', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'whole genome']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,465370,0.06751188866617575
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs.

"Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach Alcohol consumption is an etiologic essential for the development of alcohol use disorder and many alcohol pathologies. Despite evidence that genetic variations contribute to alcohol consumption, the genetic architecture remains poorly characterized. In terms of the genetic component, individual susceptibility to complex traits such as alcohol consumption arise mainly from variation in gene regulation. It has become increasingly clear in recent years that alternative polyadenylation (APA) – a mechanism by which a single gene encodes multiple RNA isoforms with different polyadenylation (polyA) sites – is extensively used to modulate gene regulation. An improved understanding of the genetic causes of predisposition to alcohol-related problems will facilitate a precision medicine approach through better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.  Yet shortcomings in current methods for concurrent APA identification and RNA transcript quantitation in high-throughput short read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) studies have limited our ability to study its genetic contributions to alcohol-related phenotypes. To remedy this, a novel trans-omics method and related software will be developed here that can precisely identify expressed polyA sites and accurately quantify individual isoforms including APA transcripts from a sequenced RNA-Seq library. Specifically, a supervised machine learning algorithm will be built that utilizes both RNA-Seq data and DNA sequence indicators to predict the locations of expressed polyA sites (Aim 1). The “use-all-data” approach will identify and quantify APA isoforms present in the data with greater precision than current, one-dimensional omics techniques. Furthermore, the algorithm will be designed for integration into existing bioinformatics pipelines for quantitation along with other RNA species (Aim 2).  To determine the influence of APA on the genetic predisposition to alcohol consumption, a systems genetics approach will be applied to relate brain RNA expression of the APA isoforms and other RNA molecules, including protein-coding, long non-coding, and microRNA (miRNA) transcripts, to alcohol consumption measures in a two-bottle choice paradigm (Aim 3). From this approach, if and how APA influences gene networks and susceptibility to miRNA regulation, what genetic factors control APA, and how APA may influence alcohol consumption can be evaluated.  An extensive fellowship training plan and a team of mentors with diverse skillsets will be utilized to accomplish the multidisciplinary research project. The result of this training will be an alcohol researcher with not only the latest bioinformatics and computational skills but also the knowledge and experience to interpret, refine, and improve these models in the context of alcohol research. By following a training plan that incorporates the best of both disciplines, this proposal will be an example of a new type of alcohol researcher that can harness big data in a disease relevant way. Understanding the role of alternative polyadenylation (APA) in alcohol-related phenotypes and pathologies will provide important insights into biological mechanisms related to alcohol for improved diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of alcohol-related problems. The proposed research will study the association of APA with a predisposition for free-choice alcohol consumption using a novel trans-omics computational approach.",Elucidating the role of alternative polyadenylation in alcohol related phenotypes using a novel trans-omics computational approach,10073326,F31AA027430,"['3&apos', ' Untranslated Regions', 'Adopted', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fabry Disease', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Fellowship', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Hypertrophy', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Inbreeding', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metachromatic Leukodystrophy', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear Export', 'Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Polyadenylation', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Rattus', 'Recombinants', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'alcohol prevention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cohort', 'consumption measures', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic architecture', 'improved', 'insight', 'mRNA Stability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'skills', 'software development', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment strategy', 'user-friendly']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,F31,2020,26651,0.07567582183736384
"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9980343,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,118134,0.07975400295300018
"Developing a mobile alcohol biosensor platform for use in medication testing research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This mentored patient-oriented research career development award (K23) will enable Dr. Roberts to achieve his long-term career goal of becoming an independent clinical researcher working to develop pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This proposal outlines a 5-year training plan that supports a research program focused on developing a mobile biosensor platform for tracking medication effects on alcohol reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Training domains include 1) mobile biosensor assessment of alcohol use, 2) management and analysis of biosensor data, and 3) AUD pharmacotherapy development research. The training plan includes a strategic combination of mentor-led trainings; coursework in mobile health sensing, data science, statistics, bioethics, clinical research methods, and grant writing; attendance at relevant conferences and workshops; and collaboration with investigators conducting research in AUD pharmacotherapy development. The candidate will complete these training activities while completing a research program aimed at developing a mobile biosensor platform that can passively track alcohol consumption and deliver conditional assessments at key points during drinking episodes. In these preliminary studies, heavy drinkers with AUD will wear the mobile biosensors and receive alcohol in the laboratory. In Experiment 1, participants will receive two fixed doses of alcohol while wearing the biosensors and responding to prompted assessments. Goals of this experiment will be to 1) refine the machine-learning derived detection algorithms that will identify key points during drinking episodes and 2) evaluate the user experience and feasibility of delivering prompted assessments on a smartphone during drinking episodes. Experiment 2 will test the detection algorithms in a separate sample of freely behaving participants engaged in self-paced alcohol drinking. Results of these studies will serve as pilot data to support an R-mechanism application to develop a formal paradigm using the biosensor platform to track medication effects of alcohol use and reactivity in ambulating outpatients. Dr. Roberts has assembled an mentorship committee of leaders in the field. Dr. McKee (primary mentor) is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale University. She applies innovative laboratory paradigms to AUD pharmacotherapy development research, and she has several lines of research using mobile health biosensors to track substance use behavior. Dr. Ramchandani (primary co-mentor) is a clinical investigator and Chief of the Human Psychopharmacology Section at the NIAAA intramural research program. He will lead Dr. Roberts's training in alcohol pharmacokinetics. Drs. Gueorguieva, Petrakis, and Gerstein will serve as secondary mentors and contribute to Dr. Roberts's training in longitudinal data analysis, AUD pharmacotherapy clinical trials, and machine learning and data science, respectively. Drs. Miranda and Barnett will serve as external advisers and support Dr. Roberts's training in ambulatory assessment in the context of medication development research and transdermal alcohol detection, respectively. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder is a potentially disabling disease with a large economic and health burden in the United States.

"Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning Despite the widespread use of Motivational Interviewing (MI), the underlying mechanisms of its success are still poorly understood [14], especially the link between client change talk and subsequent behavior change [14,69]. Previous research has identified two possible active components underlying MI efficacy: a relational component involving elements of the therapist-client dyad including the expression of empathy, and a technical component focused on the differential evocation of client behaviors such as change talk or what a client says about their commitment to change [57]. Current analyses of these components are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project will address shortcomings of current MI coding systems by introducing a novel computational framework that leverages our recent advances in automatic verbal and nonverbal behavior analyses as well as multimodal machine learning. Our framework aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better identify in-session change talk and sustain talk that is predictive of post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated audio data from two NIAAA- funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=91; N=158). We will disseminate our findings through an extensive collection of client and dyadic behaviors through our proposed Client and Dyadic Behavior Databases. In addition, we will validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations. Current analyses of Motivational Interviewing (MI) process are limited to investigations pertaining to language only and are restricted by expensive and arduous manual coding which, despite the time and efforts expended to achieve reliability, may still not be sufficiently sensitive or specific to adequately test the complex theoretical propositions espoused by MI theorists. Our project introduces a computational framework that aims to jointly analyze verbal (i.e., what is being said), nonverbal (i.e., how something is said), and dyadic (i.e., in what interpersonal context something is said) behavior to better predict in- session change talk and sustain talk and subsequent changes in post-session alcohol use. We will leverage already collected and annotated data from two NIAAA-funded single-session MI randomized clinical trials to improve drinking behavior (N=99 and N=193) and validate the generalizability of our computational framework using seven additional NIAAA- and federally funded RCTs that used different MI protocols for different target populations.",Automatic Coding of Therapist and Client Language in Motivational Interviewing to Predict Reductions in Alcohol Use and Problems Using Machine-based Dyadic Multimodal Representation Learning,10001411,R01AA027225,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Assertiveness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Client', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Elements', 'Empathy', 'Facial Expression', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Gestures', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Intervention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Visual', 'Vocabulary', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'computer framework', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'multi-task learning', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,554280,0.08256630935130937
"Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goals of this mentored, patient-oriented, research career development award are two-fold: 1) Characterize the autonomic nervous system correlates of stress-reactivity, both in laboratory and ambulatory contexts in order to inform the development of a biosensor driven, stress-detection classifier algorithm that can run on commercially available smartwatches, and 2) establish the principal investigator as an independent researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School. The specific aims of this research will be accomplished through an innovative study leveraging the strengths of traditional laboratory-based, psychophysiological research, and cutting-edge, in natura monitoring of stress and stress’ autonomic correlates using a combination of ecological momentary assessment of affect, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. This research will inform the development of a stress-detection algorithm that will run on commercially available smartwatches. The clinical and health applications for real-time stress detection are numerous, but this technology holds particular promise for individuals in early recovery from alcohol use disorder for whom unchecked stress heightens risk for alcohol use and engagement in other maladaptive coping behaviors. The smartwatch-embedded stress detection algorithm developed in this research will ultimately be linked to existing smartphone-based relapse prevention apps that will prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use risk. Aims of the principal investigator’s career development and training plan include, 1) learning fundamental principles of machine learning with an emphasis on biosensor technologies, 2) gaining facility with Matlab programming, with an emphasis on signal analysis and psychophysiological model building, 3) broadening expertise in cardiovascular waveform and interval analysis with particular emphasis on artefact management, and 4) acquiring skills in the development and application of mHealth-based clinical interventions. These goals will be achieved through a training plan comprised of mentorship, formal coursework, seminars, conferences, and manuscript preparation. Knowledge gained via the training plan will be augmented by the research undertaken. Drs. John Kelly, Paolo Bonato, Gari Clifford, and Bettina Hoeppner will serve as mentors on this award, and will provide targeted expertise in machine learning approaches, Matlab programing, artefact management, and mHealth treatment development. Massachusetts General Hospital - Harvard Medical School provides an exceptional environment in which to conduct this training and research. By the end of the 5-year award period, the goals are to have a working stress-detection classifier algorithm ready for R01 testing, and for the principal investigator to be established as an independent investigator. This award is consistent with NIH's goal of increasing and maintaining a strong cohort of investigators to address the nation's clinical research needs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alcohol use disorder carries tremendous personal and societal costs, and in spite of best clinical efforts, this disorder is characterized by very high relapse rates following treatment. There is a pressing need for novel interventions that prevent alcohol use relapse, and help individuals achieve sustained remission. This study will develop the algorithms that will enable the biosensors embedded in commercially available smartwatches to detect stress in real time using physiological measures of autonomic arousal, which will ultimately be used to trigger smartphone relapse prevention apps to prompt patients with real-time coaching to mitigate alcohol use relapse risk.","Bringing real-time stress detection to scale: Development of a biosensor driven, stress detection classifier for smartwatches",9891764,K23AA027577,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biosensor', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complement', 'Coping Behavior', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motivation', 'Notification', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress', 'Targeted Research', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'acute stress', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'classification algorithm', 'classifier algorithm', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'deter alcohol use', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'early alcohol use', 'experience', 'fitness', 'health application', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'model building', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'programs', 'real time monitoring', 'reduced alcohol use', 'relapse risk', 'skills', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'societal costs', 'stress management', 'stress reactivity', 'stress state', 'stressor', 'symposium', 'therapy development', 'time use', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIAAA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,184140,0.08409172840804736
"Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use Project Summary/Abstract  Insufficient knowledge of brain-based risk factors for problem cannabis use is a key barrier to identifying individuals at risk for cannabis-related harm and designing targeted prevention and early intervention approaches to promote positive development for persons at risk. The current proposal combines multiple, large- scale, neuroimaging datasets with novel densely-sampled fMRI data to identify a neuromarker of problem cannabis use and characterize its development prior to cannabis use onset, and in the context of current cannabis use in adolescence. We will apply a whole-brain, machine-learning method – connectome-based predictive modeling – to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use in a large sample of college students (Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students study; BARCS), and compare this network to canonical neural networks previously implicated in risk for cannabis use: frontoparietal, salience, and default mode networks. We will then examine the developmental trajectory of these cannabis risk networks in relation to other known risk factors for addiction prior to cannabis use onset in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a nationally-representative sample of 11,875 children. We will examine whether individuals at high-risk for substance use problems (family history of substance use and exposure to early adversity) display a delay in the typical trajectory of network stabilization within cannabis risk networks. Finally, we will collect densely-sampled fMRI data (4 scans in 6 months) from 20 adolescents (age 15-17) who regularly use cannabis and 20 age- and sex-matched typically-developing adolescents. This study design will enable us to examine cannabis effects on short-term neural network dynamics and evaluate whether cannabis using adolescents are characterized by reduced stability of cannabis risk networks relative to their typically-developing peers. By combining multiple existing large-scale neuroimaging datasets with original, longitudinal, densely- sampled fMRI data, the proposed study design offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay between neural mechanisms of risk for problem use and cannabis exposure effects on the developing adolescent brain and promises to yield important insights into the neural mechanisms of risk for problem cannabis use that can foster novel prevention and intervention initiatives to mitigate cannabis-related harms for individuals at high risk.  The current proposal also aims to provide Dr. Sarah Lichenstein with expert mentorship by Drs. Pearlson, Casey, Yip, Scheinost and Stevens to build the skills necessary to develop into an independent clinical scientist applying multimodal neuroimaging methods to study the pathophysiology of addiction. Dr. Lichenstein will pursue specialized training in studying cannabis effects on brain and behavior, big data science, and the conduct of research with adolescent participants. Furthermore, the collection of novel, densely-sampled, adolescent fMRI data will also provide Dr. Lichenstein with a rich and unique pilot dataset to support the submission of a R01 application by the end of the award period and facilitate her transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Cannabis use is extremely common and associated with clinically-significant negative outcomes for a subset of users, yet it is not currently possible to predict who is at highest risk for cannabis-related harms at the individual level. The current proposal aims to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use, and to characterize the development of this network both before and after cannabis use onset. Elucidating the neural basis of problem cannabis use will facilitate the development of novel prevention and early intervention efforts to mitigate potential cannabis-related harms for individuals at highest risk.",Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use,10038977,K08DA051667,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Cannabis', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol research', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain behavior', 'brain research', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'skills', 'university student']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,191700,0.06335838174239078
"Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Alcohol Consumption and Mental Health in Young People PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The COVID-19 pandemic, best characterized as a disaster, is unprecedented in its impact on individuals, societies, and the economy. Of special consideration is the effect of the pandemic on the psychological wellbeing and behavior of young people. Here, we propose leveraging the longitudinal, multi-site National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study (2012-2022) to investigate changes in wellbeing and behaviors, with a focus on alcohol use in response to the pandemic, in an established sample of young people including moderate-heavy users and those at risk for alcohol use, and to identify risk and protective factors for distress in response to the pandemic. Using NCANDA, we are able to directly address research objectives of NOSI NOT-OD-20-097 to understand social, behavioral and economic impacts from containment and mitigation efforts implemented to reduce spread of the COVID-19 disease, as well as downstream health impacts including substance use/abuse, and to determine risk and resiliency factors and outcomes. Unlike most research in this area, NCANDA includes neurobiological data critical to complement clinical and self-report data in understanding the complex and dynamic interactions leading up to and following a disaster. Also, with its accelerated longitudinal design and current age of participants spanning 17-28 years old, NCANDA is uniquely powered to disentangle age and pandemic related effects, unlike traditional same-age cohort designs. We propose supplementing the NCANDA project with a brief COVID-19 survey about alcohol use, mood, and other behaviors during the pandemic as well as COVID-19 exposure and pandemic-related distress, administered to participants in June 2020. To track long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the survey will be re-administered in Winter 2020 and Summer 2021. By embedding this survey, time-linked to the pandemic, within the existing NCANDA dataset, we propose characterizing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on alcohol use, mental health, and brain in young people (Aim 1) and to evaluate risk and resilience factors for COVID-19 pandemic-related distress (Aim 2). We propose using advanced analytics, including machine learning approaches, to identify a `signature' from the rich information captured by neuroimaging, clinical and self-report data prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, that predicts distress versus resilience in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. A machine-learning approach embraces the complexity of the COVID-19 pandemic-related influence and takes advantage of the multi-domains within the NCANDA dataset. The analysis proposed in this supplement will offer valuable longitudinal data in a well-characterized sample of young people who are bridging developmental years into adulthood and that includes those at high risk for, or current heavy users of, alcohol. Such information can be used to guide public health and intervention strategies to benefit vulnerable young populations in the event of future disasters. PROJECT NARRATIVE The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, best characterized as a disaster, is expansive and includes unprecedented effects on the psychological wellbeing and behavior of youth. Here, we propose leveraging the longitudinal, multi-site National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) study to investigate changes in wellbeing and behaviors, with a focus on alcohol use in response to the pandemic, in an established sample of young people including moderate-heavy users and those at risk for alcohol use, and to use advanced machine learning approaches with neuroimaging and clinical data to identify risk and protective factors for distress in response to the pandemic. This work could be critical for developing strategies to mitigate disaster impact on young people and to prevent additional problems, such as heavy substance use, from starting.",Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Alcohol Consumption and Mental Health in Young People,10171298,U01AA021696,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Containment', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Distress', 'Dorsal', 'Economics', 'Event', 'Family', 'Feeling', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Public Health', 'Quarantine', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Shelter facility', 'Site', 'Social isolation', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Well in self', 'Work', 'Youth', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse childhood events', 'alcohol availability', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol risk', 'anxiety symptoms', 'behavioral economics', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'coping', 'coping mechanism', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'drinking', 'economic impact', 'experience', 'fear of falling', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'longitudinal design', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'news', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'protective factors', 'psychiatric symptom', 'psychobiology', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'public health intervention', 'resilience', 'response', 'sleep quality', 'social', 'traumatic stress']",NIAAA,SRI INTERNATIONAL,U01,2020,198581,0.10057384807107056
"Alcohol Misuse: An Independent Risk Factor that Increases the Incidence and Severity of COVID-19 ABSTRACT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in unprecedented morbidity and mortality. Risk factors like age, obesity, and comorbidity impact the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID- 19 leading to hospital ICU admission and death. Additional risk factors that promote exaggerated immune and inflammatory response to the virus leading to severe disease or death must exist. One such risk factor could be alcohol consumption because: (1) Alcohol is the most frequently used drug in the United States. (2) Patients hospitalized for pneumonia who have an alcohol use disorder (AUD) are at greater risk for developing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) (the primary cause of death in COVID-19) than non-AUD patients; and (3) Alcohol negatively impacts function of the immune system and results in an inappropriate response to pathogens (a primary mechanism of severe COVID-19 and ARDS); and (4) Alcohol disrupts the intestinal microbiome (dysbiosis) and intestinal and lung barriers which can both further promote inflammation and contribute to ARDS. Accordingly, we hypothesize that alcohol misuse is an independent risk factor that increases the incidence and severity of COVID-19 by promoting exaggerated and dysregulated immune- inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2. We will leverage our COVID-19 data and biorepository at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC), which has tested over 22,000 patients (68% minority) with over 6000 patients testing positive, over 1000 hospitalized, over 600 critically ill. Currently, all patients arriving at RUMC are screened for alcohol use with AUDIT. Our COVID-19 biorepository has banked nasopharyngeal swabs, serum/plasma, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We will address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine if alcohol use or misuse increases severity of COVID-19 and elucidate interactions with other risk factors. In this cross sectional study, we will use a machine learning classifier to determine if increased alcohol use/misuse are associated with more severe clinical presentation and poorer COVID-19 health outcomes (in 12,000 RUMC, 6000 COVID-19+) patients. Aim 2. Determine the impact of alcohol use and misuse on COVID-19 disease course and the impact of COVID-19 on alcohol consumption. In this longitudinal study, we will conduct longitudinal analysis of alcohol use in 6000 patients positive for COVID-19 to determine: (2a) if alcohol use/misuse is associated with slower recovery from COVID-19-associated symptoms. Aim 3. Determine if alcohol misuse results in exaggerated immune-inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and more organ dysfunction in COVID-19 patients and explore the mechanisms. In this mechanistic Aim, we will compare COVID-19 patients with different disease severity to determine if alcohol misuse is associated with: (3a) altered immune/inflammatory response. (3b) disrupted intestinal barrier integrity. We will use machine learning and other advanced informatics approaches to investigate these Aims to discover new mechanisms for alcohol-COVID-19 interactions for prevention and therapeutic targets for COVID-19. NARRATIVE The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed and threatens our society. However we know very little about the underlying mechanisms and comorbidities that cause severe symptoms in some COVID-19 patients. Alcohol use has been shown to make the flu and other respiratory diseases worse and we think this may be true for COVID-19 and alcohol as well. This study will investigate if alcohol use makes COVID-19 worse and how. Identifying this new information about COVID-19 pathology and a role for alcohol could support new recommendations from physicians regarding alcohol and new targets for COVID-19 patient therapies.",Alcohol Misuse: An Independent Risk Factor that Increases the Incidence and Severity of COVID-19,10163399,R24AA026801,"['2019-nCoV', '3-nitrotyrosine', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Anxiety', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Circadian desynchrony', 'Clinical', 'Coughing', 'Critical Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Emergency department visit', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Ethanol toxicity', 'Evaluation', 'Fever Chills', 'Fibrin fragment D', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Food', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informatics', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intestines', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Liver diseases', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Minority', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Pneumonia', 'Prevention', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Shortness of Breath', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Smell Perception', 'Smoking', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress', 'Stressful Event', 'Structure', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'Taste Perception', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United States', 'Virus', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol response', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol use disorder', 'associated symptom', 'biobank', 'circadian', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'dysbiosis', 'flu', 'gut microbiome', 'immune system function', 'intestinal barrier', 'learning classifier', 'lifestyle factors', 'longitudinal analysis', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'resilience', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'soluble RAGE', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue injury', 'zonulin']",NIAAA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R24,2020,313862,0.10931477466935827
"Large-scale Data Scientific Assessment of Unhealthy Alcohol Consumption Among Front-Line Restaurant Workers Summary:  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices. Many individuals engaging in excessive alcohol consumption do not make it to treatment until it has had large, sometimes catastrophic, negative effects on their life. Mobile phone apps and social media, with care taken for consent and privacy, offer an avenue for large-scale behavior-based study within an ecological context. This proposal seeks to develop techniques for the study of and prediction of unhealthy alcohol consumption within the real-world context of the restaurant industry, a population where excessive alcohol consumption is highly prevalent. Using innovative and rigorous data science techniques, we will study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) two types of empathy: depleting and beneficial. In the process we will: (1) build a large and secure registry of digital mobile data (N = 5,925) about drinking behavior, (2) evaluate existing data-driven assessments of psychological states, (3) use machine learning to improve assessments of psychological states and predict future drinking behavior, and (4) perform one of the largest scale studies, to date, of the relationship between psychological state and unhealthy drinking. Our specific aims include: (1) Automatically assess the association of unhealthy alcohol consumption with affect, stress, and empathy among restaurant industry workers based on their linguistic behavior in social media and text messaging; (2) Develop a mobile app for longitudinal collection of fine-grained daily psychological health to analyze relation to and build prospective predictive models of daily drinking patterns; (3) Examine community affect, stress, empathy, and open-vocabulary factors, as represented by millions of local posts on public social media and assess their relationship to individual drinking behavior for restaurant industry workers. Each aim includes both the development of computational research tools and the testing of specific hypotheses. Constructs range from those with an extensive literature with respect to unhealthy drinking (emotional states), to those with burgeoning and conflicting research (stress), to those that are highly novel (empathy). We have extensive experience in collecting data and developing apps, including preliminary work at recruiting bartenders and servers. Related research and our preliminary work already suggests that there are strong links between unhealthy drinking and digital language data. We will release our software tools -- the app platform and predictive models -- under open source licenses accompanied with instructional tutorials. We see this work as trail-blazing a broad use-case for data scientific language-based assessments to study unhealthy drinking. Narrative  Unhealthy alcohol consumption is ecological, embedded within people’s everyday lives, but it is difficult to study individuals outside of laboratories and treatment offices. Focused on bartenders and servers, an at risk population, we will use innovative and rigorous data science techniques over mobile and social media data to study the cross-sectional, prospective longitudinal, and community-based relationships between unhealthy drinking and (a) affective states, (b) stress, and (c) empathy.

"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.

"Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers ABSTRACT  Binge or heavy episodic drinking has been on the rise and is associated with a range of harmful consequences that scale up with the high intensity drinking prevalent among young adults. Evidence on the nature and extent of neural changes associated with binge drinking (BD) is scant, especially as regards sex differences, so more sensitive, high-precision imaging modalities are needed to examine persistent brain alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods are sensitive to brain function, as well as different neural tissue properties, and are well suited to provide multidimensional insight into the structure and organization of the brain. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies in BD, evidence obtained from individuals with alcohol use disorder suggests that degradation of prefrontal functions may contribute to impaired executive functions and an inability to refrain from hazardous drinking. Consistent with findings in alcohol use disorder, our data and other evidence indicate that BD participants show compensatory engagement of additional brain areas to maintain adequate performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Complementary MRI modalities can reveal the nature and regional specificity of structural degradation that underlies and constrains the compensatory reorganization.  The overall aim of this project is to use a range of MRI-based methods to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult binge drinking men and women. Because of their spatial precision and sensitivity to different neural tissue properties and functional features, MRI-based methods can provide insights into structural and functional alterations at the level of an interactive system. Specifically, BOLD fMRI will evaluate functional activation during tasks that probe cognitive control; resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis will examine alterations at the level of a functional network, while structural degradation will be reflected in gray and white matter morphometric features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will characterize white matter microstructure and tract-based changes. These measures will be obtained from young adult men and women (18-30 yrs) who will be assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups based on their drinking patterns and will be equated on age, race/ethnicity, and family history of alcoholism. Interactions between binge drinking and sex will be examined in all analyses. Overall, we hypothesize that neural alterations will correlate with a range of alcohol-related variables, with greater deficits and increased compensatory activity observed in BDs who engage in higher intensity drinking, with BD women being especially susceptible to functional deficits and structural degradation. Data will be integrated across imaging modalities in a machine learning classifier framework that will inform a predictive model of drinking trajectories based on 6-mos and 12-mos longitudinal follow-ups. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, personality and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the type and extend of the neural degradation underlying executive deficits and compensatory brain reorganization. NARRATIVE  The overall aim of this project is to use a multimodal MRI approach to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult men and women engaging in binge drinking.

"Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials PROJECT SUMMARY Pharmacological and behavioral treatments of alcohol use disorder are only useful to the extent that their effects are robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps to maximizing scientific reliability; however, it has historically been largely overlooked in the health sciences. Alcohol researchers are increasingly utilizing complex statistical models (e.g., growth curves, mixture models, social networks); yet, accessible methods for sample size determination for all but the simplest statistical tests have not been broadly disseminated. Moreover, even for models in which software programs are readily available, scientists consistently express uncertainty regarding expected parameter estimates, prohibiting the utility of power analysis itself. As a result, many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are likely not optimally designed to allow for conclusive statistical inference. The overall objective of this proposal is to close this gap by developing a generalized method for power analysis using a combination of established and innovative approaches that can be used to generate and test a vast array of models used in treatment research. This objective will be achieved by pursuing two specific aims: develop a flexible, user-friendly software interface for statistical power and sensitivity analysis (Aim 1); and develop a generalized framework for determining model parameter estimates (Aim 2). The proposal is innovative because the software interface will be grounded in state-of-the-art advancements in computational technology and human-computer interaction. In addition, the framework will be fortified by advances in generalizability-theory-based meta-analyses and guided walk and machine-learning-based simulation studies investigating the effects of uncertainty in individual model parameters on the likelihood of observing hypothesized effects. The software will include automated sensitivity analyses to identify parameters with the largest impact on power and will recommend starting parameters. Development and testing will be grounded in the naltrexone and cognitive behavioral therapy literatures. Their widespread use and diversity of methodological approaches make them ideal testbeds from which to generalize to other treatment domains. This research is synergistic with each of the goals within the NIAAA Strategic Plan (2017-2021). Perhaps most significantly, methodology and guidelines will be developed for designing RCTs that have sufficient precision to distinguish trajectories, mechanisms, heterogeneity, and specificity of treatment efficacy. These efforts will provide researchers with the required a priori information to execute studies that ensure the robustness of their results. The development of these tools for RCT design will have implications for all areas of alcohol treatment research, including in-the-moment risk behaviors, person- level (comorbid) characteristics, targeting underserved and vulnerable populations, and large-scale initiatives. As a result, this proposal will allow for more definitive identification of efficacious interventions and treatments of alcohol use disorder. PROJECT NARRATIVE NIH-funded research is critical to addressing the nearly 44% lifetime prevalence of alcohol use disorder and reducing the $224 billion in annual preventable costs associated with drinking; thus, it is imperative that conclusions drawn from alcohol treatment research be robust and reliable. A priori determination of statistical power is one of the most significant steps in maximizing valid statistical inferences; yet, it has been historically overlooked in the health sciences and few tools exist for ensuring its accurate estimation. This proposal will develop a generalized framework for determining starting parameters and a flexible and user-friendly software platform for conducting power analyses of a wide range of study designs utilized by alcohol treatment researchers, thereby improving the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of health science research and enhancing the scientific integrity of clinical and public health initiatives based on such findings.",Toward a Generalized Framework and Flexible Software Environment for Power Analysis of Alcohol Treatment Randomized Controlled Trials,9999397,R01AA027264,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Non-linear Models', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Persons', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Social Network', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uncertainty', 'Underserved Population', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Walking', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'effective therapy', 'flexibility', 'health science research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'model design', 'novel', 'online registry', 'open data', 'power analysis', 'programs', 'randomized controlled design', 'simulation', 'simulation game', 'syntax', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment effect', 'treatment research', 'treatment trial', 'trial design', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'virtual', 'web app']",NIAAA,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,671748,0.08884398590569326
"NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT During young adulthood, drinking dramatically increases, with binge-level drinking peaking at age 22 and nearly half of individuals who drink report binge-level alcohol use. Frequent binge alcohol use during the protracted neuromaturation extending into the mid 20s may result in greater brain and cognitive effects than similar alcohol use in later adulthood. This application is in response to RFA-AA-17-005, Continuation of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA) Data Analysis Resource (U24) to determine the predictors and effects of accelerated alcohol use in adolescence and young adulthood. NCANDA-2 will follow the initial cohort of 831 participants (ages 12-21 at first visit) from 5 collection sites and acquire the necessary data to advance our understanding of adolescent development and the effects of alcohol use on the adolescent and young adult brain using multimodal neuroimaging, cognitive testing, and behavioral assessment. The examination of alcohol consequences will focus on structural and functional maturation of brain areas that actively develop during adolescence, are involved in psychological regulation, respond to rewards, and appear vulnerable to deleterious effects of alcohol. With the additional longitudinal data provided by this renewal, we will determine the effects of alcohol exposure on the developmental trajectory of the adolescent human brain and identify preexisting psychobiological vulnerabilities that may put an adolescent or young adult at elevated risk for an alcohol use disorder. The Data Analysis Resource (DAR) will 1) oversee data collection with standardization and comparability across sites; 2) perform data analysis for core measures collected at each site; 3) facilitate across-site pooling and centralized data storage; 4) create a database across assessment modalities for efficient retrieval; 5) coordinate data and resource sharing; 6) harmonize data across sites; and 7) create and implement novel, multimodality analyses using machine learning to engage broad spectrum data. The DAR has 5 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Maintain standardized procedures for collection of neuroimaging, neuropsychological, and clinical  assessment data and harmonize with existing large-scale neurodevelopmental research efforts. Aim 2. Ensure across-site quality control for imaging and neuropsychological data acquisition. Aim 3. Maintain and advance informatics infrastructure for data submission, analysis, and distribution.  a) Maintain a database integrating the diverse and comprehensive data from all NCANDA sites.  b) Provide data to consortium PIs for hypothesis testing within and across experimental domains. Aim 4. Provide macrostructural, microstructural, and fMRI neuroimage processing and analysis. Aim 5. Develop and maintain a data sharing and distribution system for the scientific public. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Data Analysis Resource will provide analysis of longitudinal data provided by this renewal to determine the extent to which structural and functional deficits in neurodevelopmental maturation precede, are caused by, or are exacerbated by initiation of appreciable alcohol use in adolescence.",NCANDA: DATA ANALYSIS RESOURCE,9961331,U24AA021697,"['Abstinence', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Heart Rate', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Quality Control', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Saccades', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Visit', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol expectancy', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol measurement', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'binge drinking', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'data submission', 'drinking', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'externalizing behavior', 'follow-up', 'informatics infrastructure', 'information processing', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal design', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychobiologic', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,SRI INTERNATIONAL,U24,2020,1032001,0.13457726030922357
"3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV - Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA) Alcohol Use Disorders (AUDs) and hazardous drinking are the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the US and are responsible for 10% of all deaths among working age adults. Among Persons Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH), heavy alcohol use is up to twice the rate in the general population. Few people engage in behavioral alcohol treatment and alcohol pharmacotherapies are not routinely used as part of alcohol treatment, despite the known efficacy of these interventions. PLWH engaged in treatment for their HIV disease have regular contact with a medical provider and are treated in a medical home model in which all medical services are delivered within HIV clinics, but few HIV providers feel comfortable treating AUDs. During our initial funding period, we implemented routine alcohol screening, developed a computerized brief intervention (CBI), and conducted provider training on alcohol pharmacotherapies. However, while we found a strong impact from routine screening with CBI for reducing alcohol use, few providers prescribed alcohol pharmacotherapy, despite this specialized training, with most indicating continued discomfort and lack of knowledge for use of pharmacotherapy. Algorithms are used routinely to guide providers in treatment selection for many different disorders that are not within their specialty such as diabetes management, obesity, arthritis, and other disorders. In addition, we tested the use of provider algorithms for the treatment of depression and smoking with PLWH and demonstrated increased utilization of these medications. For this renewal, we are proposing an implementation science test of using an algorithm that will build upon our success with CBI and integrate alcohol pharmacotherapies and other behavioral therapies within routine treatment. A decision-tree algorithm that provides more intensive treatments, including alcohol pharmacotherapies, that is also responsive to comorbidities such as depressive or anxiety symptoms will be tested in three HIV clinics across CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS). Primary outcomes include reduced alcohol consumption and frequency, improved HIV outcomes, and improvement in comorbid conditions. We will also examine provider, staff, patient, and clinic-level facilitators and barriers to implementation of this algorithm in routine clinical care. Successful implementation of this treatment approach would have considerable impact on reducing AUDs among PLWH and could be integrated within existing electronic health record systems for a sustainable model of alcohol treatment delivery to other HIV clinics. Hazardous alcohol use is the fourth leading cause of preventable death in the United States and is up to twice as high among PLWH. Algorithms have been developed to increase the efficacy of the treatment of chronic diseases with tremendous success but have never been empirically tested to aid in alcohol use disorders (AUDs). We propose to test an algorithm developed to aid providers in selecting behavioral and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of AUDs for PLWH engaged in care.",3/3 Alcohol Research Consortium in HIV - Intervention Research Arm (ARCH-IRA),10003109,U01AA020802,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Achievement', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Arthritis', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Trees', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Drug usage', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geography', 'HIV', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Home environment', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol screening', 'alcohol services', 'alcohol use disorder', 'anxiety symptoms', 'arm', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brief alcohol intervention', 'brief intervention', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'consumption measures', 'depressive symptoms', 'diabetes management', 'drinking', 'evidence base', 'hazardous drinking', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical specialties', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'reduced alcohol use', 'routine screening', 'smoking cessation', 'success', 'transmission process', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U01,2020,347377,0.11742113533138542
"Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App? Development and Feasibility Testing of a StepAway 'Bot' PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT A wide gap exists between the number of individuals needing alcohol treatment and those actually receiving it. Many factors account for this gap, including stigma, treatment availability and affordability, and individuals wanting to solve their problems independently. Technologically-delivered interventions may dramatically increase the number of individuals who receive needed alcohol intervention services due to their ability to circumvent treatment barriers. Smartphones are the ideal devices to provide empirically-supported intervention assistance whenever and wherever it is needed. Our research team previously developed and tested a stand-alone, self-administered smartphone-based intervention system for alcohol use disorders that was based on empirically supported face-to-face treatments. This Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A) system provided a progression through psychoeducational modules and in-the-moment interventions to reduce the likelihood of drinking. In a preliminary 6-week trial study, we contrasted the LBMI-A with a web-based intervention, the Drinker's Checkup (DCU) that was supplemented with bibliotherapy. While alcohol consumption was reduced by >50% in both interventions, only the LBMI-A produced a significant increase in percentage of days abstinent. Greater LBMI-A usage was associated with greater reductions in drinking. A revised and improved iPhone-based version, Step Away, has been developed and has been used by individuals downloading it from the iTunes App Store. Our Step Away usage data indicate that user engagement with modules that are not “pushed” to the user is relatively low, which is a problem that many health apps experience. A new method of delivering Step Away through an artificially intelligent chatbot will be developed in this study that holds potential for providing enhanced user engagement and effectiveness as it can reach out through a text interface to introduce new intervention steps and respond to the user with Step Away's in-the-moment help with having a craving, experiencing distress or needing social support. It could serve as a personal assistant that guides a user through a process of changing their drinking. This project will focus on developing a Step Away chatbot during the first phase of the study. We will also enhance the existing Step Away app's user interface for optimal usability. The second phase will entail performing a pilot study to determine if the Step Away chatbot has enhanced user engagement, intervention fidelity and outcome efficacy in comparison to the Step Away app among a group of problem drinkers. A control condition will consist of a minimal intervention; an assessment-only app. Participants will be interviewed to determine their perceptions of both interventions with a view towards understanding barriers to user engagement. Finally, this project will set the stage for a further, large-scale evaluation of Step Away, the content of which will be determined by the outcome of the pilot study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Smartphone-based alcohol interventions hold potential to bridge the wide gap between the number of individuals needing alcohol intervention and those actually receiving it, but more research is needed about their outcome efficacy and the optimal way to engage users in this new type of intervention. This study will continue to refine an empirically supported smartphone app (Step Away) and develop a similarly focused chatbot that will serve as a personal assistant to an individual interested in changing their drinking. We will also perform a pilot study that will compare user engagement and alcohol outcome variables across the two approaches.",Can a Chatbot-delivered Alcohol Intervention Engage Users and Enhance Outcomes Over a Smartphone App?

"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of “non-monotone” missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ﬂawed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ﬁxed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiﬁc domains, making “stress-testing” to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiﬁc reporting.

"Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of this study is to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that link acute alcohol intoxication with cigarette use in young nondaily smokers (ages 21-25). Nondaily smokers experience fewer symptoms of cigarette withdrawal than daily smokers; however, they still experience difficulty quitting. Since smoking cessation before the age of 30 substantially attenuates the long-term health consequences associated with smoking, understanding the factors that motivate cigarette use in young nondaily smokers and developing tailored interventions will be critical for curbing cigarette use and improving public health. The proposed project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how acute alcohol intoxication impacts brain function and will assess the extent to which alcohol-induced changes in brain function correlate with impulsive choice, cigarette craving, and craving regulation in young adults. Furthermore, we will assess how alcohol-induced changes in brain function, impulsivity, craving, and capacity for craving regulation predict cigarette use over the course of 1 year.  This K01 application advances the PI's long-term research goal of establishing an independent line of research examining neurobiological markers that confer risk for future substance use disorder using multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The proposed training plan will enable the PI to develop skills and expertise in five primary areas: 1) design and implementation of longitudinal studies, 2) task-based and resting- state fMRI, 3) advanced statistical methods, 4) the assessment of acute neurobiological responses to drugs and 5) the neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive choice. The training program combines formal coursework with mentorship from experienced consultants who are experts in the proposed areas of training. This project will leverage the intellectual and institutional support at OHSU and in Dr. Nagel's Developmental Brain Imaging Laboratory in order to develop a new line of research that will form the foundation for a career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although rates of cigarette use are declining, the proportion of nondaily smokers is rising, particularly among young adults. Among young adults, nondaily smoking is associated with negative health consequences and, for some, may lead to the establishment of life-long smoking patterns. The goal of this project is to understand the behavioral, psychological and neurobiological factors that contribute to cigarette use in nondaily smokers to aid the development of tailored evidence-based interventions.",Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers,9901500,K01DA046649,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Beverages', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cigarette', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol response', 'base', 'career', 'cigarette smoking', 'craving', 'design', 'discounting', 'drinking', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'problem drinker', 'psychologic', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking intervention', 'statistical and machine learning', 'therapeutic target', 'young adult']",NIDA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,183179,0.046146883505940796
"Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Large-scale U.S. epidemiological studies demonstrate that alcohol use disorders are highly prevalent, highly co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders, disabling, and often go untreated. Compared with other U.S. ethnic groups, Native Americans have the highest rates of alcohol and other drug dependence, and it is associated with particularly significant disability and mortality. Thus studies that identify specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in Native Americans, are of high public health importance. Alcohol use disorders are complex genetic diseases sensitive to environmental conditions that require complex data strategies to uncover the underlying risk factors. Although recent years have seen significant advancement in our understanding in the biology and genetics of the disorders, exactly how these factors interact in an individual to confer risk or protection from alcohol use disorders is still unclear. Further, the genetic factors identified in the human genome thus far by conventional methods appear to only explain a very small fraction of the overall heritability for the disorders.  The overall objective of this research program is to identify the complex genetic and genomic factors that affect susceptibility to alcohol use disorders and related comorbidities through novel and innovative quantitative methods and big data analytics. The proposed study will utilize whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from a unique high-risk Native American population and a European American population along with gene expression data of alcoholic human brains. The project will develop methodology to analyze WGS data with unique relevance to alcohol research. Selected multivariate, graphical, and dimension-reduction modeling tools will be used in combination with mixed models suitable for genomic data with both population and family structures to dissect polygenic basis for alcohol use disorders and shared genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders and comorbid disorders. Mixture models and clustering methods will be employed to uncover heterogeneous genetic influences. Differential genetic effects at various levels of heterogeneity will be tested with rigorous statistical methods. The project will identify population and ancestry-specific genetic risk factors and shared risk factors across populations and determine their differential influences on susceptibility to alcohol use disorders. Endophenotypes will also be investigated to help identify unique risk factors for alcohol use disorder traits. The project will further identify alcohol- and addiction-relevant pathways and networks that are differentially expressed in alcoholic brains, and establish directions of causations by combining gene expression data with WGS data, and applying instrumental variable approaches. Finally, an integrated system approach will be taken by further leveraging epigenomic maps and annotation databases in the public domain to build predictive and potentially causal models aimed at more “personalized” prevention and intervention for alcohol use disorders in specific high-risk groups and individuals. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Alcohol use disorders are prevalent, frequently co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, are disabling and often go untreated. Identifying specific genetic risk factors for alcohol use disorders in the general U.S. population, and especially in high risk ethnic groups such as Native Americans, will lead to more personalized thus more effective prevention and intervention for alcoholism in these populations.",Big data analytics for the evaluation of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data in alcohol research,9981554,K25AA025095,"['Affect', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Ethnic group', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family Study', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Native Americans', 'New South Wales', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Siblings', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'addiction', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol research', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'causal model', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'complex data ', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'endophenotype', 'epidemiology study', 'epigenomics', 'family structure', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-alcoholic', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'predictive modeling', 'problem drinker', 'programs', 'risk sharing', 'statistics', 'tissue resource', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIAAA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K25,2020,161460,0.1475075889190427
"Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a time of dramatic development, much of which varies as a function of sex. Also during this time, alcohol use becomes very common. Likely due to heightened plasticity, the adolescent brain is particularly susceptible to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. While studies have separately documented cross- sectional sex differences in the effects of alcohol on the adolescent brain and hormonal influences on normative adolescent brain development, to fully understand sex-specific adolescent risk and resilience for alcoholism, multimodal prospective longitudinal studies are crucial. To that end, during this funding period, we will assess an additional 120 healthy non-alcohol/drug using 14-16-year-old youth using functional neuroimaging during working memory and decision making, resting state functional neuroimaging, diffusion tensor imaging, neurocognitive assessment, mood/behavior/personality assessment, and serum hormone assays. Together with over 200 youth assessed during the first funding period of the project, all youth will be quarterly monitore for changes in alcohol/drug use, and youth who emerge into heavy alcohol use (as well as a matched non-using control) will be re-assessed at two time points following initiation of heavy drinking behavior. Using a multi-modal longitudinal design, we aim to better understand sex-specific effects of heavy alcohol use on adolescent brain functioning and connectivity, as well as identify premorbid sex-specific neurobiological risk phenotypes that are predictive of problem drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Further, we will explore moderating variables, such timing and frequency of alcohol and other drug use, as well as the role of gonadal steroids on sex-specific developmental trajectories. Disentangling sex- specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence, in relation to normative brain development, and determining which effects may be hormonally influenced, will move the field closer to more personalized prevention and intervention strategies aimed at male and female youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to longitudinally examine sex-specific alcohol effects on the adolescent brain and identify sex-specific neurobiological risk markers that are predictive of high levels of drinking during adolescence and young adulthood. Understanding sex-specific risk for and consequences of alcohol use during adolescence is a crucial step toward developing more informed prevention and treatment strategies.",Sex Differences in Alcohol-Related Neurotoxicity During Adolescence,9939354,R01AA017664,"['16 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Estradiol', 'Female', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Glare', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male Adolescents', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Parietal', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Personality Assessment', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Sex Differences', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'alcohol and other drug', 'alcohol consequences', 'alcohol effect', 'base', 'binge drinking', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotional behavior', 'improved', 'individualized prevention', 'longitudinal design', 'male', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotoxic', 'neurotoxicity', 'predictive marker', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'treatment strategy', 'underage drinking', 'young adult']",NIAAA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,397524,0.15686126774775533
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center Project Summary/Abstract In its initial funding period, the ABCD consortium used a rigorous epidemiological approach to recruit a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10-year-olds through our 21 research sites, of which 2136 are twins or triplets. ABCD has created a comprehensive yet efficient protocol for participating youth and parents, using standardized and state-of-the-art methods for neuroimaging, biospecimens, and assessments of substance use, mental and physical health, neurocognition, culture, and environment, using a fully digital platform and making use of mobile technologies. We ensure cohesion and standardization by having employed a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC), which will: maintain and update the harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; perform rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay- derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state-of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; continue development of infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows; and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,878 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC) will maintain and update harmonized MRI protocols across sites and scanners, perform quality control of raw and derived data, and implement the informatics and computational infrastructure needed for the overall project.","ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center",9981957,U24DA041123,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caffeine', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Update', 'Youth', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'data archive', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'data quality', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high standard', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'infrastructure development', 'mobile computing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'success', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'web portal']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2020,1020000,0.043621997301600816
"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism,10004489,R00AA024778,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Extramural Activities', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Loudness', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Review Literature', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'aged', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'faculty research', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'negative affect', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'predicting response', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2020,249000,0.14968487958640705
