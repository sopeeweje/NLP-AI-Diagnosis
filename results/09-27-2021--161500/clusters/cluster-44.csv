"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens. However, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods. This project will develop and apply novel statistical and machine learning methods for interpreting mass spectra.",Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry,9627997,R01GM121818,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Column Chromatography', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Economics', 'Fertilization', 'Game Theory', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Joints', 'Libraries', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operations Research', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Shotguns', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'disease phenotype', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mass spectrometer', 'mathematical theory', 'novel', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'speech recognition', 'statistics', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'theories', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,315830,0.16338125391404965
"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web. Our tools promise to change current practices in interpreting metabolomics data beyond what is currently possible with databases, current annotation tools, statistical and overrepresentation analysis, or combinations thereof. The use of machine learning and large data sets as proposed herein defines the most promising research direction in metabolomics analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Untargeted Metabolomics is a recently developed technique that allows the measurement of thousands of molecules in a biological sample. This work proposes several novel computational techniques that address limitations of current metabolomics analysis tools.

"Feature Learning For Improved Multiplex Disease Diagnosis Abstract This proposal is for CATTS, a feature learning technique optimized for use in multiplex mass spectrometry (MS) fingerprinting assays. MS fingerprints consist of a large number of chemical species, leading to very high dimensional feature spaces, and subsequent high false-discovery rates.

Our preliminary results demonstrate that, when used as a feature-learning technique for a variety of classification methods, CATTS significantly improves assay sensitivity. This proposal takes our existing implementation of CATTS and extends it to support additional feature learning algorithms and classification methods. Additionally, its performance as a multiplex assay strategy will be tested on both protein and lipid MS fingerprint libraries, with an eye towards commercialization..

"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies. The current application addresses this need by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for integrative analysis of static and dynamic metabolomics measurements, as well as easy-to-use open-source software to facilitate the application of these methods.",Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways,9667435,R01GM114029,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anabolism', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Funding', 'Galaxy', 'Homeostasis', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,337658,0.1229474608951501
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9788239,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,562232,0.026881949701824975
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9608754,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,356625,0.10561524880200522
"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks.

"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9751141,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2019,1186500,0.06097649288764966

"Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract:  The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging due to its clinical heterogeneity and lengthy differential diagnosis. The incorrect assignment of a diagnosis of MS occurs in approximately 9% of newly evaluated patients and is associated with considerable clinically important, and avoidable, medical risk, morbidity, and healthcare costs. At the same time studies have demonstrated that many patients encounter a significant diagnostic delay prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of MS. In such patients early and accurate diagnosis of MS can result in prompt initiation of disease modifying therapy and consequent preventable disability. MS remains a clinical diagnosis and diagnostic criteria for MS are revised periodically, including most recently in 2017. Since implementation of the 2017 criteria, like all prior revisions, will continue to rely on subjective clinical and radiological assessments for its fulfillment, misdiagnosis will remain a risk.  New objective, automated, and clinically applicable approaches to MS diagnosis are needed. Recent preliminary data from cross-sectional pilot studies in patients with established diagnoses have shown promise for three new radiographic and three new laboratory methods to differentiate MS from other disorders. The present study will evaluate these six methods for the first time in a prospective cohort of 125 patients undergoing an initial evaluation for MS at an academic MS subspecialty center. The specificity and sensitivity of each method will be compared to fulfillment of 2017 MS diagnostic criteria at the time of initial clinical evaluation. Using diagnostic thresholds developed from this analysis, a two year post-enrollment analysis will also be performed in participants who did not meet 2017 criteria initially but did so during the subsequent two year interval to determine if the study methods could have predicted a diagnosis of MS earlier in such patients. The use of a multimodal and machine-learning approach to evaluate the integration of each of these six new methods which represent different aspects of MS neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes will also be performed during each analysis, and such a combination of radiographic and laboratory methodology may provide superior diagnostic accuracy compared to any given method alone.  Planned collaborative career development, mentoring, and advising activities will facilitate acquisition of specific advanced quantitative and qualitative research skills necessary to develop and coordinate collection of data for this large prospective cohort study to rigorously evaluate new diagnostic methods for MS and incorporate machine learning analyses. Successful completion of this study will provide experience and skills necessary to move the field of MS diagnosis forward through a planned prospective multicenter NIH R01 funded study. Project Narrative: A highly specific, sensitive, objective and automated novel diagnostic approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) is needed maximize early benefits of disease modifying therapy in patients with MS and to prevent the frequent problem of MS misdiagnosis. This project assesses three novel MRI techniques and three novel blood tests for the diagnosis of MS in a large prospective cohort undergoing a new clinical evaluation for suspect MS. While each method may show promise alone, utilization of machine learning methodology combining these approaches that represent different aspects of MS pathophysiology may demonstrate a highly accurate and clinically applicable methodology for MS diagnosis.",Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers,9646600,K02NS109340,"['Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atrophic', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'C-Peptide', 'Central Vein', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Qualitative Research', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Whole Blood', 'accurate diagnosis', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neurofilament', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel imaging technique', 'polypeptide C', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'specific biomarkers', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K02,2019,193783,0.06668399651407324
"Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach Project Summary: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young and middle-aged adults, is a highly heterogeneous disease, with wide variations in clinical presentation, disease course and response to treatment. In order to personalize care in MS, it is important to harness its clinical heterogeneity and the diversity of its underlying pathology, and to develop models able to predict individual behavior of patients. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), acquired routinely in MS patients, contain information that reflects underlying pathophysiology, which may be brought into light through quantitative analyses. Radiomics, a technique well developed in oncology, converts routine medical images into mineable high-dimensional data that can be modeled to support clinical decision-making. The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that radiomic analysis, combined with careful feature selection and accurate modeling, can predict patient outcome and response to therapy using standard-of-care MRI in MS. Our hypothesis will be tested by leveraging existing 3-year imaging and clinical data from the CombiRx trial, a multi-center, phase-III investigation of combination therapy in 1008 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. We will first determine the potential for non-invasive radiomic biomarkers of disease severity in RRMS. Towards this goal, we will extract radiomic features of MS lesions from FLAIR, pre and postcontrast T1-weighted MR images using an open-source radiomic pipeline. Through appropriate feature selection, we will identify an independent radiomic feature set able to characterize individual phenotype on MRI in a selection cohort. We will then evaluate the selected features cross-sectionally to determine their efficacy in characterizing disease severity, leveraging training and validation subsets. The performance of our radiomic approach will be compared to traditional models using clinical and standard imaging markers such as lesion volume. In the second stage of this proposal, we will explore the performance of radiomic-based models to predict long-term outcome and treatment response in MS. We will build models to predict disease activity free status (DAFS) at 3 years using selected baseline radiomic features, and identify treatment response phenotypes. We will investigate and compare the performance of various machine-learning models in an unbiased manner. Finally, we will assess the effect of each therapeutic regimen on radiomic features by comparing on-treatment changes across treatment arms. This may provide evidence for treatment-specific monitoring parameters.   Project Narrative:    Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and disabling disorder of the central nervous system affecting over 1  million  individuals  in  the  United  States.  Unambiguous  and  robust  clinical  prediction  of  individual  outcome  and  treatment  response  is  deeply  needed  to  provide  personalized  medicine  to  MS  patients,  reduce disability, and minimize the burden of MS on individuals and society. Radiomics has the potential  to contribute to decision-­‐support systems in MS, by transforming routinely acquired magnetic resonance  images into mineable high-­‐dimensional data.   ",Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach,9824996,R03NS109715,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'digital', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'middle age', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'oncology', 'open source', 'patient response', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'routine practice', 'standard of care', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2019,88953,0.01011945048544891

"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease.

"High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Glycosylation fulfills important physiological functions, including protein folding, embryogenesis, cell adhesion, pathogen recognition, and immune response. The multifaceted roles glycosylation plays derive from the presence of a range of glycan epitopes, where a small structural variation can have a profound impact on functions. Further, a glycome consists of many closely related structures, with their relative amounts determined by metabolic conditions in a cell- and growth-specific manner. Altered glycosylation is linked to many diseases, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Thus, there is a clear need for analytical methods that can rapidly identify and quantify the many glycoforms in a glycome from different health and disease states. Finally, no genome-predicted glycan database exists due to the unscripted nature of glycan biosynthesis, and discovery of new glycan structures must be achieved by de novo methods. Although tandem mass spectrometry-based biopolymer sequencing has been the major catalyst to the recent rapid advance of 'omics, the prevailing collisionally activated dissociation method often fails to provide sufficient glycan structural detail at the MS2 level, whereas the MSn approach lacks the speed, sensitivity, and quantitative potential for high-throughput glycome analysis. We have recently developed an electronic excitation dissociation (EED) method that can yield rich structural information in a single stage of MS/MS analysis. However, the impact of EED on glycomics research is currently limited by its poor accessibility, insufficient coupling to on-line glycan separation methods, and difficulty in interpretation of complex glycan EED tandem mass spectra. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach that combines EED with on-line liquid chromatography (LC) separation and a novel bioinformatics tool to achieve high-throughput, de novo, and comprehensive glycome characterization. We will explore the potential of EED for analysis of glycans in various derivatized forms, study their fragmentation behaviors, and establish fragmentation rules for the development of bioinformatics software. We will optimize conditions for efficient coupling of EED to reversed-phase, and porous graphitic carbon LC, and develop an LC-EED-MS/MS approach for simultaneous characterization and quantitation of glycan mixtures. We will implement EED on a Q-TOF instrument to improve its access to the glycoscience community. Finally, we will develop and rigorously test the performance of a novel bioinformatics software that can rapidly and accurately determine each glycan's structure from its tandem MS spectra. The proposed algorithm is fundamentally different from most existing software, in that it no longer relies solely on glycosidic and cross-ring fragments for topology and linkage analysis, but rather adopts a machine learning approach that considers the contexts of various types of fragment peaks, and the spectral features associated with different linkage configurations and structural motifs. The availability of such a high-throughput, de novo glycan sequencing tool will have an immense impact on many biomedical research fields, as glycosylation plays critical roles in almost all biological pathways. High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Project narrative Characterization of glycans from biological sources requires sensitive and high-throughput analytical methods that can separate and identify each glycoform in a complex mixture. We propose to develop an HPLC-EED- MS/MS method for comprehensive glycome characterization.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics PROJECT SUMMARY  Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths for U.S. women and the deadliest gynecological disease. Lack of symptoms in addition to the deficiency of highly specific biomarkers for detection typically result in only 25% of OC cases being diagnosed at FIGO stage I. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent form of OC, but three rarer histological subtypes also exist— endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. An effective screening strategy for early diagnosis would be particularly advantageous since 5-year OC survival rates can be as high as 90%. Unfortunately, protein biomarkers such as CA-125 do not have sufficient positive predictive value to be useful from a clinical perspective. We hypothesize that useful information regarding early stage HGSC and other ovarian cancers can be found in the serum metabolome. Our pilot studies in both humans and OC models, such as the double-knockout Dicer-Pten mouse recently developed by our team members, show great promise in this regard— average sensitivity and specificity for early detection have reached 97.8% and 99.0% in banked human serum samples, and up to100% in mice. These results have prompted us to perform a much deeper investigation of metabolome alterations associated with early stage ovarian cancers in larger serum sample sets, and over time. We will perform metabolomics experiments in mice and banked de-identified human serum samples with much higher coverage than before by “data fusing” various modes of ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), coupled with pathway-centric data analysis. We also propose supplementing serum-level metabolomics experiments with deep-coverage tissue mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) in both 2-D and 3-D, using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which have complementary ionization mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose to depart from the commonly used approach of tentatively identifying spectral features by only using accurate masses, and implement a “deep metabolite annotation” approach that uses both “fused” high-resolution techniques (high field Orbitrap MS, MS/MS, 2-D NMR) and a new technology based on collisional cross section predictions for both travelling wave and drift tube ion mobility-MS. High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most common and deadliest type of ovarian cancer; it is diagnosed mostly at an advanced stage at which the cancer has already spread beyond the ovary or the fallopian tube, to the abdominal cavity. This advanced-stage diagnosis inevitably causes high mortality. In this project, we propose to study molecular changes associated with early disease both in mouse models that closely mimic human disease and in banked de-identified human serum samples, with the aim of ultimately designing a robust diagnostic panel.",Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics,9789208,R01CA218664,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'CA-125 Antigen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Female Genital Diseases', 'Genes', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Greater sac of peritoneum', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Mucinous', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Ovarian', 'Ovary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Premalignant', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Reproductive system', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Screening for Ovarian Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serous', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer diagnosis', 'design', 'diagnostic panel', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'hydrophilicity', 'ion mobility', 'ionization', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'protein biomarkers', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'uncertain malignant potential neoplasm']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,398117,0.08267808821453655
"UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides Abstract. Gram-negative bacteria have caused many of the most persistent infections as well as some of the deadliest pandemics in the world. Some strains have developed resistant to all available drugs, thus leading to increasing mortality from previously treatable bacterial infections. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9625817,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigen vaccine', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2019,187702,0.033179488099524646
"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens.

"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies. The current application addresses this need by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for integrative analysis of static and dynamic metabolomics measurements, as well as easy-to-use open-source software to facilitate the application of these methods.",Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways,9462161,R01GM114029,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anabolism', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Funding', 'Galaxy', 'Homeostasis', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,338393,0.1229474608951501
"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9659850,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,593526,0.026881949701824975
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9406318,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,356625,0.10561524880200522
"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9562959,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2018,1186500,0.06097649288764966
"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,9589711,U01CA235508,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'stable isotope', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'working group']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,439996,0.0975187376779859
"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards.

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) rests on clinical symptoms and examinations as  outlined in the revised McDonald’s criteria supported by appropriate magnetic resonance imaging findings and  other laboratory tests. The need for early diagnosis is clearly emphasized in a position paper produced in 2015  by MS Brain Health organization called “Brain health, Time matters in multiple sclerosis’ which is endorsed by  the major organizations and foundations that advocate for MS research, providers and patients including  Accelerated Cure Project (ACP), Americans Committed for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis  (ACTRIMS), The Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), European Brain Council (EBC), European  Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), European Multiple Sclerosis Platform  (EMSP), International Society of Neuroimmunology (ISNI), International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis  Nurses (IOMSN), National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Trust (MS). To cite from  their executive summary page: (1) “A therapeutic strategy that offers the best chance of preserving brain  and spinal cord tissue early in the disease course needs to be widely accepted – and urgently adopted.”  (2) “Significant delays often occur before a person with symptoms suggestive of MS sees a neurologist  for diagnosis and treatment.” (3) “Early intervention is vital.” (bold type face is theirs, not ours).   The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be  built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for  several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not  code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic  complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases  that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that  disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In  this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease  than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on MS as a disease category and have identified and validated MS associated  differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and  exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose  to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include  1) subjects with RRMS, 2) healthy controls, 3) neurologic disease controls including both inflammatory and non- inflammatory disorders, and 4) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S.  and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to  distinguish the MS cohorts from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is a subjective diagnosis based largely on clinical  symptoms and MRI findings disseminated in time and space. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate this diagnosis  is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs  with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that  classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess  greater accuracy to identify presence of MS in a subject earlier than is currently available leading to  preservation of ‘brain health’.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis,9501679,R44AI124766,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Demyelinations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Europe', 'European', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Laboratories', 'Latin American', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Messenger RNA', 'Middle East', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Northern Africa', 'Nurses', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'RNA', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'infancy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimmunology', 'phase 1 study', 'preservation']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2018,320550,-0.02023333938242423
"West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification Project Summary – Overall West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) The West Coast Metabolomics Center for Compound Identification (WCMC) is committed to the overall goals of the NIH Common Fund Metabolomics Initiative and specifically aims to largely improve small molecule identifications. Understanding metabolism is important to gain insight into biochemical processes and relevant to battle diseases such as cancer, obesity and diabetes. Compound identification in metabolomics is still a daunting task with many unknown compounds and false positive identifications. The major goal of the WCMC is therefore to develop processes and resources that accelerate and improve the accuracy of the compound identification workflow for experts and medical professionals. The WCMC for Compound Identification is structured in three different entities: the Administrative Core, the Computational Core and the Experimental Core. The Center is led by the Director Prof. Fiehn in close collaboration with quantum chemistry experts Prof. Wang and Prof. Tantillo, and metabolomics experts Dr. Barupal and Dr. Kind with broad support from mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics and programming experts. The Administrative Core will assist the Computational and Experimental Core to develop and validate large in-silico mass spectral libraries, retention time prediction models and innovative methods for constraining and ranking lists of isomers in an integrated process of cheminformatics tools and databases. The developed tools and databases will be made available to all Common Fund Metabolomics Consortium (CF-MC) members and professional working groups. The WCMC will also provide guidance for compound identification to the National Metabolomics Data Repository. The broad dissemination of developed compound identification protocols, training for compound identification workflows, databases and distribution of internal reference standard kits for metabolomic standardization will overall widely support the metabolomics community.

"Feature Learning For Improved Multiplex Disease Diagnosis Abstract This proposal is for CATTS, a feature learning technique optimized for use in multiplex mass spectrometry (MS) fingerprinting assays. MS fingerprints consist of a large number of chemical species, leading to very high dimensional feature spaces, and subsequent high false-discovery rates. CATTS aims to reduce the size of this space, by using knowledge of the underlying biochemistry, as well as general-purpose clustering algorithms. Our preliminary results demonstrate that, when used as a feature-learning technique for a variety of classification methods, CATTS significantly improves assay sensitivity. This proposal takes our existing implementation of CATTS and extends it to support additional feature learning algorithms and classification methods. Additionally, its performance as a multiplex assay strategy will be tested on both protein and lipid MS fingerprint libraries, with an eye towards commercialization.. Relevance to public health: The detection of pathogens via mass spectroscopy fingerprinting is rapidly becoming a standard technique for clinical microbiology. However, high false detection rates and conflicting multiple identifications limit applicability, and make interpretation of results difficult. Our work on CATTS aims to improve the statistical performance of these assays. Preliminary results from studies on one dataset we intend to apply CATTS to suggest that UTIs and, in some cases antimicrobial resistance, can be detected, directly from patient samples. However, the statistical methods currently employed aren't reliable enough - the further development of CATTS will accelerate the development of this, and other mass-spectroscopy-based assays..",Feature Learning For Improved Multiplex Disease Diagnosis,9559527,R43GM128538,"['Algorithms', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Biochemistry', 'Biodiversity', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Eye', 'Fingerprint', 'Immune', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protein Fingerprints', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'base', 'commercialization', 'disease diagnosis', 'feeding', 'forest', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'vector']",NIGMS,"DEURION, LLC",R43,2018,189594,0.08240152151152666
"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes.,9505949,R01HD084628,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Congo Red', 'Crowding', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Light Chain Deposition Disease', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prion Diseases', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'driving force', 'druggable target', 'extracellular', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'interest', 'maternal morbidity', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'misfolded protein', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'novel therapeutics', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2018,482654,0.0403298912966915
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined.

"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers.

"Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics PROJECT SUMMARY  Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths for U.S. women and the deadliest gynecological disease. Lack of symptoms in addition to the deficiency of highly specific biomarkers for detection typically result in only 25% of OC cases being diagnosed at FIGO stage I. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent form of OC, but three rarer histological subtypes also exist— endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. An effective screening strategy for early diagnosis would be particularly advantageous since 5-year OC survival rates can be as high as 90%. Unfortunately, protein biomarkers such as CA-125 do not have sufficient positive predictive value to be useful from a clinical perspective. We hypothesize that useful information regarding early stage HGSC and other ovarian cancers can be found in the serum metabolome. Our pilot studies in both humans and OC models, such as the double-knockout Dicer-Pten mouse recently developed by our team members, show great promise in this regard— average sensitivity and specificity for early detection have reached 97.8% and 99.0% in banked human serum samples, and up to100% in mice. These results have prompted us to perform a much deeper investigation of metabolome alterations associated with early stage ovarian cancers in larger serum sample sets, and over time. We will perform metabolomics experiments in mice and banked de-identified human serum samples with much higher coverage than before by “data fusing” various modes of ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), coupled with pathway-centric data analysis. We also propose supplementing serum-level metabolomics experiments with deep-coverage tissue mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) in both 2-D and 3-D, using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which have complementary ionization mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose to depart from the commonly used approach of tentatively identifying spectral features by only using accurate masses, and implement a “deep metabolite annotation” approach that uses both “fused” high-resolution techniques (high field Orbitrap MS, MS/MS, 2-D NMR) and a new technology based on collisional cross section predictions for both travelling wave and drift tube ion mobility-MS. High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most common and deadliest type of ovarian cancer; it is diagnosed mostly at an advanced stage at which the cancer has already spread beyond the ovary or the fallopian tube, to the abdominal cavity. This advanced-stage diagnosis inevitably causes high mortality. In this project, we propose to study molecular changes associated with early disease both in mouse models that closely mimic human disease and in banked de-identified human serum samples, with the aim of ultimately designing a robust diagnostic panel.",Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics,9470426,R01CA218664,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'CA-125 Antigen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Female Genital Diseases', 'Genes', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Greater sac of peritoneum', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Mucinous', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Ovarian', 'Ovary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Premalignant', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Reproductive system', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Screening for Ovarian Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serous', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer diagnosis', 'design', 'diagnostic panel', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'hydrophilicity', 'ion mobility', 'ionization', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'protein biomarkers', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'uncertain malignant potential neoplasm']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2018,410432,0.08267808821453655
"Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines Peptides bound to class I HLA molecules (HLA-A, -B and –C) arise from endogenous or foreign proteins that are cleaved by the proteasome and peptidases of the endoplasmic reticulum prior to loading and display by surface HLA class I proteins. Each HLA allele is estimated to bind and present ~1,000-10,000 unique peptides to T cells. Given such diversity in HLA binding, an important question is whether we can predict whether a particular peptide is likely to bind to a specific HLA allele. Indeed, peptide-binding rules have been long-studied extensively for a subset of HLA alleles and encoded in advanced neural network-based algorithms that predict binding. Historically, little attention has been paid to HLA-C because of its perceived lower surface expression and hence predictive algorithms of HLA-C are very much lacking, as only a few thousand peptides epitopes have been reported in databases. New studies, however, suggests that important epitopes can arise from HLA-C, and have been detected for HIV, EBV, CMV and influenza. Our hypothesis is that large-scale datasets of endogenous HLA bound peptides can improve prediction of binding, and that through applying such an approach to HLA-C, a substantial increase in numbers of actionable immunogenic targets on tumor cells can be gained. Recently, I spearheaded a successful effort to integrate my expertise in experimental workflows for the isolation of HLA-bound peptides with newly available innovations in analysis and instrumentation for mass spectrometry (MS) to create a high throughput MS-based approach for the physical detection of peptides directly displayed by HLA molecules. This workflow and analytic framework now provides an exciting opportunity to generate high-quality data to directly address these challenges. In Aim 1, to systematically identify HLA-C binding peptides, we will use MS to provide experimentally-derived datasets of peptides from 21 HLA-C alleles to provide 99.9% global population coverage. In Aim 2, to define the rules of processing and presentation across HLA-C de novo, we will discover the binding motifs of the HLA-C peptides and use this information to develop predictive algorithms, which we will validate using independent datasets. In Aim 3, we seek to determine if predicted tumor neoepitopes are physically detected on patient tumor cells. We will perform experimental validation of HLA-C prediction algorithms directly on tumor samples available from study subjects enrolled on high-priority clinical trials of personalized neoantigen-targeting cancer vaccines at DFCI using a new nano-scale MS-based analysis. We will confirm the immunogenicity of the detected HLA-C epitopes through in vitro T cell assays using banked peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected from study subjects. We anticipate the proposed studies to enable fuller understanding HLA-C epitope presentation, more robust prediction of HLA-C peptide epitopes, and expansion of the spectrum of actionable immune targets. Immune recognition of short peptides representative of proteins within a cell in conjunction with a group of surface molecules called HLA is essential for the process of immune reactivity but characterization of the properties of how these peptides bind to HLA molecules has been constrained by the limited available information about these peptides. We have developed a new high-throughput approach to rapidly isolate thousands of HLA-bound peptides directly from informative cell lines and tumor samples (from patients with melanoma, glioblastoma and renal cell cancer) and to use this information to develop novel algorithms to predict binding of peptides to HLA. We anticipate the proposed studies t o enable fuller understanding of how a subset of understudied HLA molecules (i.e. HLA-C) interact with their binding peptides, to improve prediction of HLA-C bound peptides, and to expand the spectrum of actionable immune targets.",Physical detection of HLA-C binding peptides to identify and predict immunogenic personal neoepitopes for improving cancer vaccines,9456316,R21CA216772,"['Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'C-Peptide', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cleaved cell', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Enrollment', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Glioblastoma', 'HIV', 'HLA-A gene', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Human', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Influenza', 'Letters', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Network-based', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specimen', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'T cell response', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Cell Line', 'Vaccine Design', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'base', 'experience', 'high risk', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'melanoma', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nanoscale', 'neoantigens', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation', 'novel', 'polypeptide C', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vaccine trial']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R21,2018,232224,0.033179488099524646
"UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides Abstract. Gram-negative bacteria have caused many of the most persistent infections as well as some of the deadliest pandemics in the world. Some strains have developed resistant to all available drugs, thus leading to increasing mortality from previously treatable bacterial infections. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria.

"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software. Project narrative The applications of mass spectrometry, and its promises for improvements of human health, are numerous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and speciﬁc diagnostic and prognostic screens.

"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies. The current application addresses this need by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for integrative analysis of static and dynamic metabolomics measurements, as well as easy-to-use open-source software to facilitate the application of these methods.",Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways,9250169,R01GM114029,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anabolism', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Funding', 'Galaxy', 'Homeostasis', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,339051,0.1229474608951501
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine.

"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9344966,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2017,1186500,0.06097649288764966

"Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) rests on clinical symptoms and examinations as  outlined in the revised McDonald’s criteria supported by appropriate magnetic resonance imaging findings and  other laboratory tests. The need for early diagnosis is clearly emphasized in a position paper produced in 2015  by MS Brain Health organization called “Brain health, Time matters in multiple sclerosis’ which is endorsed by  the major organizations and foundations that advocate for MS research, providers and patients including  Accelerated Cure Project (ACP), Americans Committed for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis  (ACTRIMS), The Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), European Brain Council (EBC), European  Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS), European Multiple Sclerosis Platform  (EMSP), International Society of Neuroimmunology (ISNI), International Organization of Multiple Sclerosis  Nurses (IOMSN), National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), and Multiple Sclerosis Trust (MS). To cite from  their executive summary page: (1) “A therapeutic strategy that offers the best chance of preserving brain  and spinal cord tissue early in the disease course needs to be widely accepted – and urgently adopted.”  (2) “Significant delays often occur before a person with symptoms suggestive of MS sees a neurologist  for diagnosis and treatment.” (3) “Early intervention is vital.” (bold type face is theirs, not ours).   The question of whether or not disease classifiers capable of providing clinically useful information could be  built based upon disease-specific expression levels of mRNAs in whole blood has been a subject of research for  several years. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are recently discovered regulatory RNA molecules that do not  code for proteins but influence a vast array of biological processes. It is also thought that lncRNAs drive biologic  complexity observed in vertebrates that may also be reflected by the greater array of complex idiopathic diseases  that humans develop. As such, our data obtained in the phase 1 portion of this work, support the notion that  disease-associated lncRNAs exhibit far greater differences in expression than disease-associated mRNAs. In  this application, we propose to explore the hypothesis that lncRNAs are better biomarkers of human disease  than mRNAs. Here, we will focus on MS as a disease category and have identified and validated MS associated  differentially expressed lncRNAs. Study of lncRNAs in human autoimmune disease is in its infancy and  exploration of lncRNAs as biomarkers of autoimmune disease has not been previously addressed. We propose  to determine expression levels of target lncRNAs in blood obtained from larger cohorts of subjects that include  1) subjects with RRMS, 2) healthy controls, 3) neurologic disease controls including both inflammatory and non- inflammatory disorders, and 4) peripheral autoimmune disease controls obtained from various sites in the U.S.  and Europe to establish a wide geographic distribution and to identify optimum machine learning classifiers to  distinguish the MS cohorts from healthy and disease control cohorts with greatest overall accuracy. Diagnosis of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) is a subjective diagnosis based largely on clinical  symptoms and MRI findings disseminated in time and space. Biomarkers to aid and accelerate this diagnosis  is an area of active investigation. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs  with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test, and supported by our phase 1 studies, is that  classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess  greater accuracy to identify presence of MS in a subject earlier than is currently available leading to  preservation of ‘brain health’.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to classify multiple sclerosis,9405679,R44AI124766,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Advocate', 'American', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Preservation', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Demyelinations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Europe', 'European', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Fibromyalgia', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Geographic Distribution', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Invertebrates', 'Investigation', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Laboratories', 'Latin American', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Messenger RNA', 'Middle East', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Northern Africa', 'Nurses', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'RNA', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Research', 'Research Subjects', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trust', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disorder control', 'experience', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'infancy', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimmunology', 'phase 1 study']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2017,504933,-0.02023333938242423
"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes.,9269245,R01HD084628,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Congo Red', 'Crowding', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Light Chain Deposition Disease', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Neonatal Mortality', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prion Diseases', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'biophysical properties', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'driving force', 'extracellular', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'interest', 'maternal morbidity', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'misfolded protein', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'novel therapeutics', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2017,488627,0.0403298912966915
"Ion mobility based informatics and visualization strategies in support of metabolomics Project Summary  Metabolites are building blocks of cellular function, thus understanding the mechanisms that underlie various physiological conditions and processes will provide insight into disease or aberrant states. Innovative developments in high-throughput analytical technologies and data analysis have allowed for systems-level metabolomics analyses to be performed, many of these technologies have centered around mass spectrometry. The diverse chemical structures in the human metabolome exhibit a wide range of concentration, solubility, polarity and volatility with highly diverse structural forms and physiochemical properties as well as a high number of isomers, therefore the need for as many orthogonal separations as possible is necessary for metabolomics experiments (i.e., multidimensional data sets). Mass spectrometry approaches incorporating liquid chromatography ion mobility mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS/MS) analyses have shown utility for global untargeted metabolic profiling experiments. Since ion mobility coupled to mass spectrometry (IM-MS) is a relatively new commercially available technology, the incorporation of the ion mobility measurement (via collision cross section, CCS) into current metabolomics data analysis identification strategies is minimal. The typical analytical use of ion mobility is as a quick chemical separation (which allows for noise reduction, increase in peak capacity, etc.), however IM can also be used to increase the confidence in identification and characterization because CCS provides structure specific information about individual metabolites. The long term objectives of this proposal are all centered around incorporating IM measurements into metabolomics based chemoinformatic and bioinformatics pipelines. These include: (1) determining the extent at which the ion mobility dimension can address molecular specificity of isomeric metabolites, (2) developing an IM-based library using CCS values as a descriptor to screen and assign identities to unknown metabolites and lastly, (3) incorporating visualization tools for navigating multidimensional datasets which will allow scientists to better uncover relationships between metabolites and human health. Molecular specificity of the IM dimension will be addressed by analyzing previously generated IM-MS data from a commercially available metabolite library (>600 primary metabolites, of which >20% are isomeric). Individual metabolites in the metabolite library will also be interrogated for curation of the CCS library and these values will be used in the molecular identification pipeline for global untargeted metabolite studies generated previously. Lastly, multidimensional self-organizing maps will be utilized to visualize and navigate various dimensions of data (LC, CCS, m/z, etc.) and ultimately allow the user to prioritize and identify with high confidence metabolites indicative of disease state. Accomplishing the aims outlined in this proposal will be seen as overcoming several critical barriers which have so far hindered the routine and widespread use of ion mobility in MS-based metabolomics workflows. Project Narrative  The innovative developments described in the proposal incorporate high-throughput metabolomics technologies, big data informatics, and multidimensional visualization strategies which will allow scientists to uncover relationships between metabolites and human health using systems-level metabolomics analyses. Specifically, we believe these goals can be accomplished by overcoming several critical barriers to adopting new technologies based on multidimensional mass spectrometry which hold promise for furthering our knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems. Strategies outlined in this proposal include, providing a highly annotated library incorporating empirical ion mobility based collision cross section values (inclusive also of exact mass, fragment ion data, and retention time) and developing novel big data and visualization strategies to improve throughput and confidence in metabolite annotations.",Ion mobility based informatics and visualization strategies in support of metabolomics,9433378,R03CA222452,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cell physiology', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Mail', 'Exhibits', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phonation', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Solubility', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'data visualization', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interest', 'ion mobility', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'professor', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R03,2017,151533,0.09974118343628781
"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism.

"UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides Abstract. Gram-negative bacteria have caused many of the most persistent infections as well as some of the deadliest pandemics in the world. Some strains have developed resistant to all available drugs, thus leading to increasing mortality from previously treatable bacterial infections. The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed work will be applied to evaluate new antimicrobials and support development of hybrid vaccines.",UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides,9320998,R01GM103655,"['Acylation', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affinity', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Vaccines', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemical Warfare', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Exhibits', 'Focus Groups', 'Glycolipids', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrophobicity', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Infection', 'Ions', 'Lipid A', 'Lipopolysaccharide Biosynthesis Pathway', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'O Antigens', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance', 'Serotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tail', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'cell envelope', 'design', 'high throughput analysis', 'hydrophilicity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'inorganic phosphate', 'instrument', 'method development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'response', 'screening', 'sugar', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'ultraviolet']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2017,297043,0.04480915341122778
"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies. The current application addresses this need by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for integrative analysis of static and dynamic metabolomics measurements, as well as easy-to-use open-source software to facilitate the application of these methods.            ",Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways,9104589,R01GM114029,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anabolism', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Funding', 'Galaxy', 'Homeostasis', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'research study', 'response', 'small molecule', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,359776,0.1229474608951501
"A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our work to develop novel algorithms for predictive modeling will for the first time combine results from the use of both metabolomics and proteomics to identify multiple biomarkers that can be used to identify those Hepatitis C (HCV) patients who have developed early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). Our long-term goal is to create a non-invasive diagnostic test that is both highly specific and sensitive for the detection of early-stage liver cancer. The overall objective of this project is the creation of a biomarker panel, developed from a predictive model, that can be used for the detection of early-stage HCC. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning algorithms can be used on urine and serum metabolomic data and/or serum proteomic data to create a predictive model for identifying those individuals with HCV that have developed early-stage HCC. The rationale underlying this project is that a combination of metabolites and proteins will yield a highly specific and sensitive predictive model to identify HCV subjects that have developed early stage HCC. Our central hypothesis will be objectively tested by pursuing two Specific Aims. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that combining proteomics data with metabolomics data will create a better predictive model for HCC. Based on preliminary data, our hypothesis is that a biomarker panel consisting of several metabolites and proteins will be more specific and sensitive than either set of data alone. Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that combining different types of metabolomics data specific to Stage IV HCV will improve the predictive accuracy of a model for the early detection of HCC. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that by combining results from multiple platforms, we will create a more specific and sensitive predictive model for the early detection of HCC in Stage IV HCV individuals than either platform alone is capable of achieving. This project is significant because it will be the first step towards the early detection of HCC, and will lead to the development of a sensitive and specific diagnostic test for early-stage HCC, and thus to improved patient outcomes and long- term survival. This research is innovative because we are using Stage IV HCV individuals with liver cirrhosis as a control for HCC individuals (as all HCC patients have some amount of cirrhosis), and in using both metabolomics and proteomics on both urine and serum samples from infected patients to identify potential biomarkers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the third most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide, yet there is no reliable diagnostic test for the early detection of the disease, when treatment options that improve long-term survival and patient outcomes are available. This project is relevant to public health because the discovery of a biomarker panel for the detection of early-stage HCC should ultimately provide new protein and metabolite targets for diagnostic assays to detect HCC in the early stages of the disease. Thus, the research in this project is relevant to that part of NIH's mission which pertains to fostering innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for improving the health of the Nation by conducting research supporting better diagnosis and treatment of human diseases.",A Multi-Omics Approach to Identify a Biomarker Panel for the Early Detection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Hepatitis C+ Individuals,9221078,R03CA211210,"['Abdomen', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Cirrhosis', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Proteins', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urine', 'Work', 'alpha-Fetoproteins', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'clinically relevant', 'diagnostic assay', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'model building', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'protein metabolite', 'research study', 'screening', 'survival outcome', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,R03,2016,155000,0.026004383637938926
"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes.,9131774,R01HD084628,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Congo Red', 'Crowding', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Light Chain Deposition Disease', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prion Diseases', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Woman', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'base', 'biobank', 'biophysical properties', 'cohort', 'curative treatments', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'driving force', 'extracellular', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'interest', 'maternal morbidity', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'neonatal outcome', 'novel therapeutics', 'perinatal morbidity', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'prototype', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2016,498328,0.0403298912966915
"Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to improve the quality, reliability, and interlaboratory comparability of peptide mass spectrometry data. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a fundamental technology for the identification and quantitative analysis of proteins, protein interactions, and protein post-translational modifications. These analyses are an important part of solving biological problems that involve changes in protein abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, the application of protein mass spectrometry measurements in the clinical laboratory has been limited. Unlike most clinical assays by mass spectrometry, which use microflow liquid chromatography, peptide measurements are commonly performed using a nanoflow liquid chromatograph interface to the mass spectrometer (nanoflow LC-MS). Despite their analytical power, these nanoflow LC-MS methods have been difficult to apply robustly in quantitative assays involving large numbers of samples from a challenging sample matrix. The successful completion of our project will result in a peptide analysis platform that can automatically assess problems with the nanoflow LC-MS system and correct the problem during an analytical run and will significantly improve the robustness and reproducibility of peptide mass spectrometry measurements. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis of proteins in health and disease. However, despite the analytical power of conventional mass spectrometry methods, they have not been well-suited for the comparative analysis of very large numbers of samples acquired under a large number of conditions. Thus, the continued development of novel mass spectrometry technology is essential to understanding complex biological systems so that can be characterized that have a change in abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbation.",Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics,9060365,R01GM107142,"['Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'comparative', 'complex biological systems', 'experience', 'improved', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mass spectrometer', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,359848,0.17600373261375293
"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,9207183,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Infection', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2016,28614,0.042922586345591165

The National Strategy for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria released by the White House in September 2014 focused on the need for (i) advancing the development of methods for identification and characterization of bacteria, (ii) accelerating basic research for new antibiotics, and (iii) improving capabilities for surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This proposal focuses on the development of innovative tandem mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the primary constituent of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria that protects the membrane from chemical attack and is recognized by the immune system during pathogenic invasion. Structural characterization of LPS is critical to understanding how the structure of LPS influences immune stimulation as well as facilitating development of new antimicrobials and vaccines. This is a significant analytical challenge due to the branched structures and amphipathic properties of LPS. The escalating concerns about antibiotic resistance bacteria and the need for better avenues of defense against infectious diseases have motivated the proposed work. The objectives of this proposal are: Aim 1: Development of ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) mass spectrometry via hierarchical, decision-tree workflows for top-down characterization of LPS to facilitate high throughput analysis; Aim 2: Development of MS/MS approaches for serotyping of Gram-negative bacteria based on LPS; Aim 3: Examination of peptide/LPS interactions via native-spray mass spectrometry to provide both mechanistic information and screening capabilities for new antimicrobials, and Aim 4: Applications to a variety of structural problems related to the biosynthesis of LPS in Gram- negative bacteria and characterization of hybrid O-antigen/lipid A molecules in vesicle-based vaccines.  We have established a new collaboration with Dr. Bryan Davies' group to develop mass spectrometry methods to characterize peptide/lipid A interactions in support of the hunt for better antimicrobials. The continued collaboration with Dr. Stephen Trent's group emphasizes: (i) approaches for deciphering the biosynthetic pathways of bacterial LPS that endow them with the remarkable ability to re-design their outer membranes and develop antibiotic resistance, and (ii) innovative vaccine design based on antigenic LPS in vesicles.    Narrative: Gram-negative bacteria are responsible for some of the deadliest and more widespread pandemics in the world. The proposed work focuses on the development of advanced mass spectrometry approaches for characterization of complex lipopolysaccharides, including the endotoxic lipid A domains, that comprise the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. The proposed work will be applied to evaluate new antimicrobials and support development of hybrid vaccines.",UVPD-MS Characterization of Lipopolysaccharides,9174984,R01GM103655,"['Acylation', 'Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Affinity', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Architecture', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Vaccines', 'Basic Science', 'Binding', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemical Warfare', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Distal', 'Exhibits', 'Focus Groups', 'Glycolipids', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Housing', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Ions', 'Lipid A', 'Lipopolysaccharide Biosynthesis Pathway', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'O Antigens', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polysaccharides', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Resistance', 'Serotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tail', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'acyl group', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cell envelope', 'combat', 'design', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'inorganic phosphate', 'instrument', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'response', 'screening', 'sugar', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'ultraviolet']",NIGMS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2016,322883,0.04480915341122778
"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application. The investigators bring complementary expertise and experience in a range of disciplines involving protein bioinformatics, algorithms, machine learning, as well as analytical chemistry and instrumentation. Overall, we believe that this proposal will result in significant advances for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. (Not modified) We propose to develop novel and theoretically sound methodology for several important yet challenging problems in mass spectrometry-based proteomics, including the identification of peptides containing post- translational modifications and cross-linked peptides, and the absolute quantification of proteins in complex samples.",Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS,8902210,R01GM103725,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Indiana', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Synthetic Peptide Libraries', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'crosslink', 'experience', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'model development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'response', 'sound', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2015,411329,0.10666967712728918
"Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional genomic strategies have been widely implemented to define unique molecular subtypes of cancer in order to predict phenotypic properties such as metastatic potential and sensitivity to therapeutic compounds. However, changes in the level of gene and protein expression can be circumstantial and therefore play no functional role in the development of the disease. One of the hallmarks of aggressive cancer is its ability to escape the cellular milieu and spread to new tissues, a process that is mediated in part by the activity of extracellular proteases. Protease activity is tightly regulated by subcelluar localization, the presence of endogenous protease inhibitors, and requisite conversion from inactive precursor forms. Therefore, in these circumstances, it is not enough to know protease expression levels alone. We propose that global profiles of extracellular protease activity may emerge as a powerful functional tool for the molecular stratification of cancer. The Craik laboratory has developed a novel mass spectrometry-based screening technology that can identify the global substrate specificity and kinetic efficiency of proteases alone and in complex biological mixtures by employing a small, diverse library of rationally designed peptide substrates. This technology, referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), marks a significant breakthrough in protease profiling by allowing for the unbiased and simultaneous detection of all protease activities in a given sample. In this proposal, the Craik laboratory will partner with the Sali laboratory to develop and test computational models that classify cancer samples on the basis of protease specificity with the goal of building protease-activatable diagnostics for subtype-specific imaging. Global profiles of extracellular protease activity from increasingly complex breast and prostate cancer samples will be determined using the MSP-MS assay. In parallel, machine learning algorithms will be used to develop specificity-based classification models that will be correlated to known metrics for tumor aggressiveness. Sub-libraries of peptide sequences that represent the major classification groups identified will aid in designing protease-activatable imaging probes that will be tested experimentally for subtype selectivity. Probe cleavage sequences will be iteratively refined to improve selectivity through both incorporation of cleavage rates into the modeling strategy and peptide docking against the 3D structures of the target proteases. The new class of reagents developed will be applied to and further optimized against clinical correlations in the next phase of the project. We anticipate that our strategy for generating tailored diagnostics for the functional profiling of cancer will advance the identification and monitoring of disease as well as aid in cancer biomarker discovery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advancements in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer require new technologies that can define disease at the molecular level. Proteases are a class of proteins that are essential molecular players in normal cellular function but also are responsible for the spread of aggressive cancers when their activities become unregulated. We are developing new computational models and screening strategies to design personalized diagnostics that target active proteases in different subtypes of cancer with the goal of improving cancer identification and informing treatment decision-making for patients.",Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer,8829207,R21CA186077,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell secretion', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug resistance', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomic approach', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Homology Modeling', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteomics', 'Reagent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Markers', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized diagnostics', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'prostate cancer cell line', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2015,168280,0.02387243223855833
"Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous disorder specific to human pregnancy and an important contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. To date, there is no cure for preeclampsia except delivery. Spearheaded by our prior proteomics research, we discovered that preeclampsia shares characteristics of protein misfolding with established conformational disorders including Alzheimer's. These features involve urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation in the amyloid proteolytic pathway in the placenta and decidua. Our overarching hypothesis is that the excessive formation of misfolded proteins in preeclampsia is driven by increased macromolecular crowding due to defective clearance and/or underlying metabolic disorders leading to faulty protein folding. As a result, the universe of misfolded proteins (misfoldome) could be a rich source of biomarkers more closely related to disease etiology than the properly folded proteome. We propose to use existing biorepositories to understand the underpinnings of different subtypes of preeclampsia. Specifically, we aim to discover specific markers and druggable targets relevant to each preeclampsia subtype that can be corrected before the onset of manifest disease. To achieve these goals we will investigate 4 ""omics"" layers: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics uniquely integrated through machine learning bioinformatics approaches aimed to solve complex and interconnected systems biology data. These include: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and ""fuzzy"" soft clustering algorithms for integration of multi-omics data layers. Specific Aim 1 plans to apply shotgun bottom-up proteomics methods to catalogue the protein components of the misfoldome as reflected in urine congophilic aggregates of women with various clinical subphenotypes of preeclampsia. The proteins and biophysical characteristics of peptide sequences in the misfoldome will be analyzed and compared with those of total urine and serum proteomes. Specific Aim 2 plans to illuminate biological pathways of high interest by triangulating proteomics with transcriptomics (RNAseq on placental villous and decidual tissues) and metabolomics (serum and urine) data. Lastly, Specific Aim 3 will validate urine congophila and the newly discovered molecular signatures in a large biorepository of women followed longitudinally during their first pregnancy (nuMoM2b cohort). Together, the three aims of this proposal offer a unique opportunity toward personalized therapeutic options for preeclampsia before the onset of clinically manifest disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Preeclampsia is a heterogeneous multi-systemic disorder of human pregnancy with unknown etiology and an important contributor to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. We determined preeclampsia shares features of protein misfolding with established protein conformational disorders including as Alzheimer's disease. Using machine learning algorithms uniquely available to our team, we will integrate four ""omics"" layers centered on the misfoldome: proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and phenomics with ultimate goal toward discovery of personalized molecular signatures and druggable targets that can be corrected before onset of manifest disease.            ",Misfoldome-centered multiOMICS approach to unravel preeclampsia subphenotypes.,8947210,R01HD084628,"['Affinity', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Congo Red', 'Crowding', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Decidua', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Light Chain Deposition Disease', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neonatal', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prion Diseases', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Secondary to', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Woman', 'base', 'biobank', 'biophysical properties', 'cohort', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'driving force', 'extracellular', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'interest', 'maternal morbidity', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal morbidity', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized therapeutic', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'prognostic', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein folding', 'protein misfolding', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'trophoblast']",NICHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R01,2015,513319,0.0403298912966915
"Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to improve the quality, reliability, and interlaboratory comparability of peptide mass spectrometry data. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a fundamental technology for the identification and quantitative analysis of proteins, protein interactions, and protein post-translational modifications. These analyses are an important part of solving biological problems that involve changes in protein abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, the application of protein mass spectrometry measurements in the clinical laboratory has been limited. Unlike most clinical assays by mass spectrometry, which use microflow liquid chromatography, peptide measurements are commonly performed using a nanoflow liquid chromatograph interface to the mass spectrometer (nanoflow LC-MS). Despite their analytical power, these nanoflow LC-MS methods have been difficult to apply robustly in quantitative assays involving large numbers of samples from a challenging sample matrix. The successful completion of our project will result in a peptide analysis platform that can automatically assess problems with the nanoflow LC-MS system and correct the problem during an analytical run and will significantly improve the robustness and reproducibility of peptide mass spectrometry measurements. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis of proteins in health and disease. However, despite the analytical power of conventional mass spectrometry methods, they have not been well-suited for the comparative analysis of very large numbers of samples acquired under a large number of conditions. Thus, the continued development of novel mass spectrometry technology is essential to understanding complex biological systems so that can be characterized that have a change in abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbation.",Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics,8840976,R01GM107142,"['Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'comparative', 'complex biological systems', 'experience', 'improved', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mass spectrometer', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'protein protein interaction', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,374279,0.17600373261375293
"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved. We will develop a kinetic model to predict peptide fragmentation spectra for any peptide sequence; a method that will enable comprehensive protein profiling in human biofluids, and the rapid design of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8853788,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virus Diseases', 'amplification detection', 'base', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2015,404827,0.042922586345591165
"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment. The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.",Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis,8829259,R01ES017080,"['6p21', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'California', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chromosomes', 'Chronology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MHC Class II Genes', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention strategy', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'prenatal', 'rare variant', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2015,572704,0.04150722054682779
"A photographic method for human body composition assessment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children. Our second specific aim is to validate the algorithm in a large diverse sample of men, women, and children. Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance. We propose a novel method for measuring the quantity of fat and skeletal muscle mass in humans quickly, painlessly, safely, accurately, and inexpensively that can subsequently be used in many large scale and remote studies.",A photographic method for human body composition assessment,8835138,R01HL107916,"['Abbreviations', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anthropometry', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Weight', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Cachexia', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Eating Disorders', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Exercise', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Height', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Obesity', 'Painless', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Plethysmography', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Radiation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Skin', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Writing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cost', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'field study', 'frailty', 'improved', 'interest', 'lean body mass', 'light weight', 'men', 'muscle form', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'portability', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'sex', 'waist circumference', 'wasting']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2015,515384,0.0059107372308052665
"Sequential Ion/Ion Reactions for Large Peptide and Whole Protein Characterization DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to sequence and identify proteins, map their sites of post-translational modification (PTM), and assess their abundances is central to modern biology. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the gold standard technology by which this information is obtained. Serving as the centerpiece, tandem MS (MS/MS) is a principal component. Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), a relatively new MS/MS dissociation method, has generated significant excitement for its compatibility with previously intractable peptide/protein classes. Five years ago m/z range, mass accuracy, and mass resolution considerably restricted the application of ETD. Our initial RO1 proposal successfully eliminated this limitation by coupling ETD to the orbitrap mass analyzer. The resulting system routinely analyzes peptides and proteins, with and without labile PTMs, with a high-fidelity readout (orbitrap). As a result, it realized many of our anticipated outcomes and created numerous unforeseen opportunities. Just in the PI's laboratory, the latter set includes data-dependent selection of dissociation method (i.e., Decision Tree), discovery of the unique chemical compositions of z-type ions, internal spectral calibration using ETD reagents, activated-ion ETD, and several biological applications. By 2008, the commercial implementation of our technology began to reach researchers across the globe-nearly 300 to date-enabling access to numerous previously intractable problems such as mapping Arg methylation sites, increasing coverage of low molecular weight proteins, providing unambiguous PTM site assignment, and screening glycopeptide libraries, among many others. We detail two new aims that build upon the high impact results of our initial funding period. Aim 1, how do we broaden the utility of ETD for biomedical research? Aim 2, what is the role of gas- phase purification in quantitative proteomics? We continue with a balance of instrumentation, method, informatic, and applied projects constructed upon the widely used ETD-orbitrap platform we described 3.5 years ago. Cutting edge MS based technology, Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), continues to be developed. This new MS/MS dissociation method enables previously intractable peptide/protein classes to be sequenced and identified, have their sites of post-translational modification (PTM) mapped, and assess their abundances. This is central to modern biology and has relevance for research ranging from human disease to evolution.",Sequential Ion/Ion Reactions for Large Peptide and Whole Protein Characterization,8838174,R01GM080148,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Dissociation', 'Electron Transport', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Glycopeptides', 'Gold', 'Housing', 'Informatics', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Outcome', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Phosphorylation', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Protein Sequence Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Protons', 'Reaction', 'Reaction Time', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Site', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Yeasts', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'comparative', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'mass analyzer', 'model development', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,337302,0.10345026610396713
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods. This project will develop and apply novel statistical and machine learning methods for interpreting mass spectra.

"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application. The investigators bring complementary expertise and experience in a range of disciplines involving protein bioinformatics, algorithms, machine learning, as well as analytical chemistry and instrumentation. Overall, we believe that this proposal will result in significant advances for mass spectrometry-based proteomics. (Not modified) We propose to develop novel and theoretically sound methodology for several important yet challenging problems in mass spectrometry-based proteomics, including the identification of peptides containing post- translational modifications and cross-linked peptides, and the absolute quantification of proteins in complex samples.",Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS,8728956,R01GM103725,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Indiana', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Post-Translational Modification Site', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Synthetic Peptide Libraries', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'crosslink', 'experience', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'model development', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'research study', 'response', 'sound', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2014,411329,0.10666967712728918
"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.

"Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional genomic strategies have been widely implemented to define unique molecular subtypes of cancer in order to predict phenotypic properties such as metastatic potential and sensitivity to therapeutic compounds. However, changes in the level of gene and protein expression can be circumstantial and therefore play no functional role in the development of the disease. One of the hallmarks of aggressive cancer is its ability to escape the cellular milieu and spread to new tissues, a process that is mediated in part by the activity of extracellular proteases. Protease activity is tightly regulated by subcelluar localization, the presence of endogenous protease inhibitors, and requisite conversion from inactive precursor forms. Therefore, in these circumstances, it is not enough to know protease expression levels alone. We propose that global profiles of extracellular protease activity may emerge as a powerful functional tool for the molecular stratification of cancer. The Craik laboratory has developed a novel mass spectrometry-based screening technology that can identify the global substrate specificity and kinetic efficiency of proteases alone and in complex biological mixtures by employing a small, diverse library of rationally designed peptide substrates. This technology, referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), marks a significant breakthrough in protease profiling by allowing for the unbiased and simultaneous detection of all protease activities in a given sample. In this proposal, the Craik laboratory will partner with the Sali laboratory to develop and test computational models that classify cancer samples on the basis of protease specificity with the goal of building protease-activatable diagnostics for subtype-specific imaging. Global profiles of extracellular protease activity from increasingly complex breast and prostate cancer samples will be determined using the MSP-MS assay. In parallel, machine learning algorithms will be used to develop specificity-based classification models that will be correlated to known metrics for tumor aggressiveness. Sub-libraries of peptide sequences that represent the major classification groups identified will aid in designing protease-activatable imaging probes that will be tested experimentally for subtype selectivity. Probe cleavage sequences will be iteratively refined to improve selectivity through both incorporation of cleavage rates into the modeling strategy and peptide docking against the 3D structures of the target proteases. The new class of reagents developed will be applied to and further optimized against clinical correlations in the next phase of the project. We anticipate that our strategy for generating tailored diagnostics for the functional profiling of cancer will advance the identification and monitoring of disease as well as aid in cancer biomarker discovery.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advancements in the diagnosis and monitoring of cancer require new technologies that can define disease at the molecular level. Proteases are a class of proteins that are essential molecular players in normal cellular function but also are responsible for the spread of aggressive cancers when their activities become unregulated. We are developing new computational models and screening strategies to design personalized diagnostics that target active proteases in different subtypes of cancer with the goal of improving cancer identification and informing treatment decision-making for patients.            ",Extracellular Proteolysis as a Molecular Stratification Tool for Cancer,8681246,R21CA186077,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Breast Cancer Model', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cell secretion', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupling', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug resistance', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Image', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'PC3 cell line', 'Patients', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Proteins', 'Proteolysis', 'Proteomics', 'Reagent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Specificity', 'Stratification', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Markers', 'Weight', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput screening', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant phenotype', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preference', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2014,201953,0.02387243223855833
"Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to improve the quality, reliability, and interlaboratory comparability of peptide mass spectrometry data. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a fundamental technology for the identification and quantitative analysis of proteins, protein interactions, and protein post-translational modifications. These analyses are an important part of solving biological problems that involve changes in protein abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, the application of protein mass spectrometry measurements in the clinical laboratory has been limited. Unlike most clinical assays by mass spectrometry, which use microflow liquid chromatography, peptide measurements are commonly performed using a nanoflow liquid chromatograph interface to the mass spectrometer (nanoflow LC-MS). Despite their analytical power, these nanoflow LC-MS methods have been difficult to apply robustly in quantitative assays involving large numbers of samples from a challenging sample matrix. The successful completion of our project will result in a peptide analysis platform that can automatically assess problems with the nanoflow LC-MS system and correct the problem during an analytical run and will significantly improve the robustness and reproducibility of peptide mass spectrometry measurements.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis of proteins in health and disease. However, despite the analytical power of conventional mass spectrometry methods, they have not been well-suited for the comparative analysis of very large numbers of samples acquired under a large number of conditions. Thus, the continued development of novel mass spectrometry technology is essential to understanding complex biological systems so that can be characterized that have a change in abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbation.",Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics,8727640,R01GM107142,"['Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Outcome', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'comparative', 'complex biological systems', 'experience', 'improved', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mass spectrometer', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,371177,0.17600373261375293
"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved. We will develop a kinetic model to predict peptide fragmentation spectra for any peptide sequence; a method that will enable comprehensive protein profiling in human biofluids, and the rapid design of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confim existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC- MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB- based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g., 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non- invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN. NARRATIVE The studies will exploit liquid chromotography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care. 3",Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue,8841436,R33AI100186,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'California', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Databases', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever', 'Dengue Virus', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Environment', 'Epidemic', 'Fingerprint', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Laboratories', 'Latin America', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Mexico', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nicaragua', 'Nicaraguan', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Management', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'clinical care', 'disease diagnosis', 'innovation', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolomics', 'outcome forecast', 'point-of-care diagnostics', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prospective', 'small molecule', 'tandem mass spectrometry']",NIAID,COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY,R33,2014,402924,0.042922586345591165
"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.         The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.

"A photographic method for human body composition assessment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children. Our second specific aim is to validate the algorithm in a large diverse sample of men, women, and children.          Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance. We propose a novel method for measuring the quantity of fat and skeletal muscle mass in humans quickly, painlessly, safely, accurately, and inexpensively that can subsequently be used in many large scale and remote studies.

"Sequential Ion/Ion Reactions for Large Peptide and Whole Protein Characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to sequence and identify proteins, map their sites of post-translational modification (PTM), and assess their abundances is central to modern biology. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the gold standard technology by which this information is obtained. Serving as the centerpiece, tandem MS (MS/MS) is a principal component. Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), a relatively new MS/MS dissociation method, has generated significant excitement for its compatibility with previously intractable peptide/protein classes. Five years ago m/z range, mass accuracy, and mass resolution considerably restricted the application of ETD. Our initial RO1 proposal successfully eliminated this limitation by coupling ETD to the orbitrap mass analyzer. The resulting system routinely analyzes peptides and proteins, with and without labile PTMs, with a high-fidelity readout (orbitrap). As a result, it realized many of our anticipated outcomes and created numerous unforeseen opportunities. Just in the PI's laboratory, the latter set includes data-dependent selection of dissociation method (i.e., Decision Tree), discovery of the unique chemical compositions of z-type ions, internal spectral calibration using ETD reagents, activated-ion ETD, and several biological applications. By 2008, the commercial implementation of our technology began to reach researchers across the globe-nearly 300 to date-enabling access to numerous previously intractable problems such as mapping Arg methylation sites, increasing coverage of low molecular weight proteins, providing unambiguous PTM site assignment, and screening glycopeptide libraries, among many others. We detail two new aims that build upon the high impact results of our initial funding period. Aim 1, how do we broaden the utility of ETD for biomedical research? Aim 2, what is the role of gas- phase purification in quantitative proteomics? We continue with a balance of instrumentation, method, informatic, and applied projects constructed upon the widely used ETD-orbitrap platform we described 3.5 years ago.        Cutting edge MS based technology, Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), continues to be developed. This new MS/MS dissociation method enables previously intractable peptide/protein classes to be sequenced and identified, have their sites of post-translational modification (PTM) mapped, and assess their abundances. This is central to modern biology and has relevance for research ranging from human disease to evolution.

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods.

"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application. The investigators bring complementary expertise and experience in a range of disciplines involving protein bioinformatics, algorithms, machine learning, as well as analytical chemistry and instrumentation. Overall, we believe that this proposal will result in significant advances for mass spectrometry-based proteomics.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients.

"Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this proposal is to improve the quality, reliability, and interlaboratory comparability of peptide mass spectrometry data. Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a fundamental technology for the identification and quantitative analysis of proteins, protein interactions, and protein post-translational modifications. These analyses are an important part of solving biological problems that involve changes in protein abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbations. Unfortunately, the application of protein mass spectrometry measurements in the clinical laboratory has been limited. Unlike most clinical assays by mass spectrometry, which use microflow liquid chromatography, peptide measurements are commonly performed using a nanoflow liquid chromatograph interface to the mass spectrometer (nanoflow LC-MS). Despite their analytical power, these nanoflow LC-MS methods have been difficult to apply robustly in quantitative assays involving large numbers of samples from a challenging sample matrix. The successful completion of our project will result in a peptide analysis platform that can automatically assess problems with the nanoflow LC-MS system and correct the problem during an analytical run and will significantly improve the robustness and reproducibility of peptide mass spectrometry measurements.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis of proteins in health and disease. However, despite the analytical power of conventional mass spectrometry methods, they have not been well-suited for the comparative analysis of very large numbers of samples acquired under a large number of conditions. Thus, the continued development of novel mass spectrometry technology is essential to understanding complex biological systems so that can be characterized that have a change in abundance in response to disease, drug treatment, and genetic or environmental perturbation.            ",Self Correcting Nanoflow LC-MS for Clinical Proteomics,8558710,R01GM107142,"['Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Outcome', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Robotics', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'comparative', 'complex biological systems', 'experience', 'improved', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mass spectrometer', 'novel', 'open source', 'operation', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,355930,0.17600373261375293
"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved. We will develop a kinetic model to predict peptide fragmentation spectra for any peptide sequence; a method that will enable comprehensive protein profiling in human biofluids, and the rapid design of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.          The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.         The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.

"A photographic method for human body composition assessment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children. Our second specific aim is to validate the algorithm in a large diverse sample of men, women, and children.          Obesity, loss of skeletal muscle with aging, and other body composition alterations are of profound public health importance. We propose a novel method for measuring the quantity of fat and skeletal muscle mass in humans quickly, painlessly, safely, accurately, and inexpensively that can subsequently be used in many large scale and remote studies.

"Sequential Ion/Ion Reactions for Large Peptide and Whole Protein Characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to sequence and identify proteins, map their sites of post-translational modification (PTM), and assess their abundances is central to modern biology. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the gold standard technology by which this information is obtained. Serving as the centerpiece, tandem MS (MS/MS) is a principal component. Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), a relatively new MS/MS dissociation method, has generated significant excitement for its compatibility with previously intractable peptide/protein classes. Five years ago m/z range, mass accuracy, and mass resolution considerably restricted the application of ETD. Our initial RO1 proposal successfully eliminated this limitation by coupling ETD to the orbitrap mass analyzer. The resulting system routinely analyzes peptides and proteins, with and without labile PTMs, with a high-fidelity readout (orbitrap). As a result, it realized many of our anticipated outcomes and created numerous unforeseen opportunities. Just in the PI's laboratory, the latter set includes data-dependent selection of dissociation method (i.e., Decision Tree), discovery of the unique chemical compositions of z-type ions, internal spectral calibration using ETD reagents, activated-ion ETD, and several biological applications. By 2008, the commercial implementation of our technology began to reach researchers across the globe-nearly 300 to date-enabling access to numerous previously intractable problems such as mapping Arg methylation sites, increasing coverage of low molecular weight proteins, providing unambiguous PTM site assignment, and screening glycopeptide libraries, among many others. We detail two new aims that build upon the high impact results of our initial funding period. Aim 1, how do we broaden the utility of ETD for biomedical research? Aim 2, what is the role of gas- phase purification in quantitative proteomics? We continue with a balance of instrumentation, method, informatic, and applied projects constructed upon the widely used ETD-orbitrap platform we described 3.5 years ago.        Cutting edge MS based technology, Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), continues to be developed. This new MS/MS dissociation method enables previously intractable peptide/protein classes to be sequenced and identified, have their sites of post-translational modification (PTM) mapped, and assess their abundances. This is central to modern biology and has relevance for research ranging from human disease to evolution.

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.        The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens. How- ever, making optimal use of mass spectrometry data requires sophisticated computational methods. This project will develop and apply novel statistical and machine learning methods for interpreting mass spectra.

"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS (Not modified) Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a widely used platform for high-throughput identification and quantification of proteins in biological samples. In addition to experimental steps in the pipeline, computational and statistical procedures play important roles in determining the content of the mixture. However, even with the best analytical platforms and modern software, only a small fraction of spectra are typically identified, thus directly impacting the quality of the biological sample analysis. If high- throughput proteomics techniques are to become routinely used in biomedical applications on the population scale, it is critical to address analytical and computational factors that contribute to the inadequate identification coverage and sensitivity. Over the past several years, we and others have spent a significant amount of research activity to understand and model analytical platforms and subsequently improve computational methods for the analyses of complex biological mixtures. While our original grant application has resulted in methods and programs already accepted by the community, there is a need and significant room for further key contributions. We see many of these contributions being related to the analyses of dynamic changes in cells and tissues, and involving changes in protein quantities, protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) and transient protein-protein interactions. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides an excellent platform to address each of these challenges. Thus, we plan to continue to develop novel methods for label-free quantification and remain close to our core strengths, but also strongly focus on PTMs and protein-protein interactions as new directions of this renewal application. This application includes a considerably closer collaboration between computational (Dr. Radivojac, Dr. Tang) and experimental (Dr. Arnold, Dr. Clemmer, Dr. Reilly) scientists than did our original application.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.

"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies. The field is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from a fragmentation mass spectrum - until this problem is solved, many potential applications of proteomics to human health will not be achieved. We will develop a kinetic model to predict peptide fragmentation spectra for any peptide sequence; a method that will enable comprehensive protein profiling in human biofluids, and the rapid design of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies.

"Metabolomics-based discovery of small molecule biomarkers for noninvasive dengue     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemic dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF/DSS) have emerged throughout the tropical world with devastating public health consequences. A dramatic increase in severe dengue disease (DEN) in Latin America in the last decade is of grave concern; 30% of cases are now diagnosed as severe dengue virus (DENV) infections. DEN is overwhelming public health capacity for clinical care in much of the developing world. The overall goal of this proposal is to provide a major change in the diagnosis and prognosis (D&P) of DENV infections. A metabolomics approach will be used to identify candidate metabolite small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) that occur both in serum and in non-invasive clinical specimens (urine and saliva) that diagnose DENV infection and predict progression to severe disease. Preliminary studies using acute phase specimens from DEN patients have identified a number of molecular features and candidate SMBs of DF and DHF/SS in serum, saliva, and urine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In the R21 phase of this project, we will use a metabolic fingerprinting approach to confirm existing and identify new candidate SMBs in retrospectively collected serum specimens available from the high-quality pediatric DEN hospital-based and cohort studies in Nicaragua, will begin to characterize the SMBs and metabolic pathways involved, will investigate the efficacy for D&P of these SMBs in prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine specimens in the hospital study, and will identify a portfolio of the most significant molecular features that differentiate DEN, severe DEN, and non-DEN disease. We will develop algorithms including SMBs, clinical signs and symptoms, and clinical laboratory results for the D&P of DENV infections. In the R33 phase of the project, prospectively collected serum, saliva, and urine samples from both the hospital study and a community-based cohort study will be analyzed by metabolic profiling using LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate SMBs. First generation EIA tests for selected SMBs will be included in the diagnostic regimen in Nicaragua The diagnostic and prognostic sensitivity and specificity of the candidate SMBs and ""first generation"" SMB tests will be determined as will the preferred clinical specimen for SMB-based diagnoses. Overall these studies will identify a panel of SMBs (e.g. 5-10), which will be used to formulate the Target Product Profiles (TPP) for rapid point-of-care (POC) tests for use in clinics and hospitals for DEN D&P. Detection of SMBs in saliva and urine that are predictive of severe DEN is innovative and provides the opportunity for a true paradigm shift in diagnosis by using inexpensive, easily procured, non-invasive clinical specimens for D&P of DEN.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections. This will be of enormous value to physicians and public health workers in the developing world to identify patients at greatest risk for severe DEN for supportive care and early therapeutic intervention, and the use of non-invasive samples will provide a true paradigm shift in DEN diagnosis and patient care.               The studies will exploit liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify small molecule biomarkers (SMBs) in serum, saliva, and urine of DEN patients for both prognosis and diagnosis of DEN infections.

"Identification of Biomarkers of Cardiotoxicity using Metabolomics of Human Plurip    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiotoxicity, as a result of adverse drug effects, is a serious problem that has yet to be effectively screened prior to patient exposure. Cardiac safety is one of the leading causes of compound attrition in the pharmaceutical industry and withdrawal of FDA-approved drugs from the market. The purpose of this proposal is to alleviate the financial burden of compound attrition due to cardiotoxicity, but more importantly, to improve public health through the development of an in vitro assay to predict a drug's ability to induce cardiotoxicity. Stemina Biomarker Discovery (""Stemina"") proposes to do so through the use of metabolomics on treated cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem (hES) and human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cells. These technologies will be used to discover human endogenous small molecule biomarkers which predict cardiotoxicity, with an emphasis on cardiomyopathy. The use of metabolomics to measure small molecules secreted by human cardiomyocytes in response to drugs is a novel approach and may pave the way for a new generation of more accurate predictive toxicology screens. Stemina has already used such a paradigm to develop predictive methods to assess development toxicology in stem cells. Stemina's long-term goal is to fully develop this humanized, high throughput cardiotoxicity screen so that it would be a valuable tool to pharmaceutical and biotech companies during preclinical development of therapeutics. In order to achieve this long term goal, Stemina is first proposing to establish an experimental platform for each cardiomyocyte culture system (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will use these systems to develop a dose response curve for each of the 24 compounds (16 cardiotoxic and 10 non-cardiotoxic) as a training set to establish a predictive metabolomic model. These dose response curves will be used to determine 3 concentrations for drug treatment to be utilized in Aim 3. Stemina will then establish a specific metabolic signature of candidate human biomarkers of drug-induced cardiotoxicity (Aim 3). To do so, human pluripotent stem (hPS) cell-derived cardiomyocytes will be treated with well-established known inducers and non-inducers of cardiotoxiciy. The spent medium from treated cells will be analyzed with mass spectrometry in order to study the secreted metabolites, or secretome, of these cells. Small molecules whose abundances vary dependent upon whether cells were treated with an inducer or non-inducer of cardiotoxicity will serve as candidate biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. In future studies, these candidate biomarkers will be validated through the use of specialized mass spectrometry techniques. Lastly, the ability of these biomarkers to adequately predict cardiotoxicity will be tested through the use of a blind study. Completion of these aims will encourage further discussions with partnering companies in order to develop a kit that can detect the validated biomarkers of cardiotoxicity. Stemina will then utilize this kit to market a service to predict whether or not a compound will induce cardiotoxicity that will serve pharmaceutical companies in pre-clinical screening trials. Such a service will provide the first humanized screening assay for cardiotoxicity based on cardiomyocyte metabolism and will likely improve public health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adverse effects of drugs to patients are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States; one such an adverse effect is drug-induced cardiotoxicity, illustrating a need for a better predictive assay for cardiotoxicity. Stemina Biomarker Discovery proposes to develop biomarkers of cardiotoxicity that would drive a service model to predict the cardiotoxicity-potential of drug candidates in order to prevent cardiotoxicity in patients. Such a product will greatly improve public health.           Adverse effects of drugs to patients are the fourth leading cause of death in the United States; one such an adverse effect is drug-induced cardiotoxicity, illustrating a need for a better predictive assay for cardiotoxicity.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.         The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.

"A photographic method for human body composition assessment     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The assessment of body composition, particularly fat and fat free mass, is vital to understanding many health-related conditions including obesity and sarcopenia, whose very definitions depend on assessment of fat and fat free mass, but also cachexia induced by HIV, cancer, and other diseases; multiple sclerosis; wasting in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy; eating disorders; proper growth in children; and yet others still. Nevertheless, challenges remain in measuring body composition. Existing methods beyond height, weight, and very simple anthropometry are still not the norm in large-scale epidemiologic studies and clinical studies. This is because of concerns, depending on method, about cost, portability, time, radiation exposure, and accuracy. Calculation of body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) is a commonly used alternative, but is limited in that it is an assessment of body weight relative to height and not of body fatness per se. A hand-held device that could be carried by any individual, accurately assess fat mass and skeletal muscle mass, and be utilized without any discomfort to the subject, inexpensively, and without radiation exposure would be highly desirable. Evidence suggests that highly experienced trained observers can accurately estimate percentage of body fat by visual examination of subjects, but concerns about accuracy and subjectivity predominate. We hypothesize that we can develop a computer algorithm which can perform as or more accurately when analyzing photographic imagery data, will require no repeated retraining, and eliminate subjectivity. Our first specific aim is to develop a computer image analysis algorithm to accurately estimate adiposity and skeletal muscle mass from standardized photographic images in a bi-ethnic sample of men, women, and children.

"Sequential Ion/Ion Reactions for Large Peptide and Whole Protein Characterization    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to sequence and identify proteins, map their sites of post-translational modification (PTM), and assess their abundances is central to modern biology. Mass spectrometry (MS) is the gold standard technology by which this information is obtained. Serving as the centerpiece, tandem MS (MS/MS) is a principal component. Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), a relatively new MS/MS dissociation method, has generated significant excitement for its compatibility with previously intractable peptide/protein classes. Five years ago m/z range, mass accuracy, and mass resolution considerably restricted the application of ETD. Our initial RO1 proposal successfully eliminated this limitation by coupling ETD to the orbitrap mass analyzer. The resulting system routinely analyzes peptides and proteins, with and without labile PTMs, with a high-fidelity readout (orbitrap). As a result, it realized many of our anticipated outcomes and created numerous unforeseen opportunities. Just in the PI's laboratory, the latter set includes data-dependent selection of dissociation method (i.e., Decision Tree), discovery of the unique chemical compositions of z-type ions, internal spectral calibration using ETD reagents, activated-ion ETD, and several biological applications. By 2008, the commercial implementation of our technology began to reach researchers across the globe-nearly 300 to date-enabling access to numerous previously intractable problems such as mapping Arg methylation sites, increasing coverage of low molecular weight proteins, providing unambiguous PTM site assignment, and screening glycopeptide libraries, among many others. We detail two new aims that build upon the high impact results of our initial funding period. Aim 1, how do we broaden the utility of ETD for biomedical research? Aim 2, what is the role of gas- phase purification in quantitative proteomics? We continue with a balance of instrumentation, method, informatic, and applied projects constructed upon the widely used ETD-orbitrap platform we described 3.5 years ago.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cutting edge MS based technology, Electron transfer dissociation (ETD), continues to be developed.

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efficient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the fields of machine learning, statistics and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets.  The core of the proposal is a type of probabilistic model, known as a dynamic Bayesian network that allows us to reason efficiently and accurately about complex sequential data sets. This modeling framework leverages a large body of related work from the fields of natural language processing and speech recognition. Much of this prior work has not yet been exploited by computational biologists, so the proposal represents a valuable cross-fertilization across disciplines.  More specifically, this project employs a collection of cooperating dynamic Bayesian networks to model jointly an entire mass spectrometry experiment. Relative to most existing methods for analyzing mass spectrometry data, which tend to divide the analysis of an experiment into a series of small independent subtasks, the proposed unified model jointly, considers all of the available data. This approach can thus exploit valuable dependencies among spectra and along various dimensions of the data. Dynamic Bayesian networks also provide a rigorous framework for performing inference from a combination of observed data and qualitative expert knowledge.  The project is divided into five aims, each of which concerns a particular type of mass spectrometry experiment. These experiments involve (1) identifying all of the proteins in a given complex biological sample using a standard mass spectrometry protocol; (2) identifying proteins using a modified protocol in which the mass spectrometer samples the data in a systematic, rather than data-dependent, fashion, with the goal of identifying lower abundance proteins; (3) quantifying the relative abundance of proteins within or between biological samples; (4) identifying post-translational modified proteins or proteins that contain sequence variation; and (5) performing targeted quantification of a specified set of proteins, such as proteins in a pathway of interest or protein biomarkers.  The methods described in this proposal have the potential to dramatically improve our ability to draw conclusions from and formulate hypotheses on the basis of high-throughput shotgun proteomics experiments. Experiments like the ones described above can, for example, identify proteins involved in fundamental disease processes, identify previously unknown protein isoforms, or quantify the re- sponses of proteins to environmental stressors or disease states.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The applications of mass spectrometry and its promises for improvements of human health are nu- merous, including an increased understanding of disease phenotypes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie them, and vastly more sensitive and specific diagnostic and prognostic screens.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.              PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.",Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS,8136044,R01NS062885,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Build-it', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'DLG1 gene', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Encephalitis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutamate Metabolism Pathway', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myelin', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neuronal Injury', 'North America', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Western Europe', 'axonal degeneration', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time interval', 'tool', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,354969,0.06487109646225746
"A New Model of Peptide Fragmentation for Improved Protein Identification and Targ    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for disease- associated biomarkers. State-of-the-art instruments can identify thousands of proteins in a single sample by 'shotgun' proteomic analysis, where protein mixtures are proteolyzed into peptides, separated by one or more chromatographic steps, and analyzed by peptide dissociation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The goal of this approach is to create new technologies for the accurate detection of proteins within complex samples. Achieving this target is currently limited by the major problem of inferring the peptide sequence from MS/MS spectra by sequence database searching: spectra are compared to ""model spectra"" generated from database sequences. Current algorithms suffer from poor accuracy and discrimination due to the use of simple models for predicting spectra, which ignores the rich information contained in the relative intensities of peaks in a typical MS/MS. Consequently, there is a vital need for more accurate models to predict MS/MS spectrum intensities from peptide sequences. In this proposal, we will develop a new and innovative kinetic model for predicting peptide fragmentation MS/MS spectra, and use the model to develop MS/MS identification algorithms with high discrimatory power. Spectra simulated by the kinetic model will then be used to design selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays, which have become a critically important technique for measuring targeted sets of proteins in human biomarker studies. This will solve a bottleneck for widespread adoption of SRM methods for biomarker discovery, which is currently hindered by the slow process of identifying and optimizing SRM transitions for the assays. The following specific aims are (1) Develop an optimized kinetic model of gas-phase peptide fragmentation which predicts MS/MS spectra for any peptide sequence. Model parameters will be fit using the Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm, a robust method for non-linear least squares. (2) Extend the model to predict MS/MS fragmentation of phosphopeptides. The approaches developed in this aim can be extended to other disease- relevant post-translational modifications which profoundly alter peptide fragmentation and interfere with MS/MS identification. (3) Develop a route to successful implementation of spectrum-to-spectrum matching algorithms, an entirely new approach for large scale identification of proteins, in which MS/MS are searched directly against libraries of predicted spectra, simulated using our prototype kinetic model. We use predicted spectra to bypass the need for sequence databases, and spectrum-to-sequence strategies altogether. (4) Develop an algorithm for de novo prediction of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) assays for highly multiplexed quantitative measurement of proteins in complex mixtures.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    PROJECT NARRATIVE Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a key technology in the search for useful protein biomarkers, and holds many promises for early detection of disease, prediction of drug efficacy and resistance, and targeted molecular therapies.

"Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex and heterogeneous inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system characterized by myelin loss, varying degrees of axonal pathology, and progressive neurological dysfunction. The combined effect of many genes, environmental exposures acting during defined periods of life, and their interactions in MS is strongly supported by our own work and others. The involvement of HLA class II genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6p21 is well-established. The identification of non-MHC determinants of MS susceptibility, while progressing, is far from complete. Similar to other complex diseases, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have begun to unravel the polygenic etiology of MS. However, variants identified through several large GWAS, to date, explain only a very small proportion of MS heritability. The proposed study describes critical post-GWAS era steps to further our current understanding of MS pathogenesis. First, we will utilize next-generation DNA sequence data, high-throughput genotyping and state-of-the-art bioinformatics methods to fully characterize rare, less frequent and common variants within more than 30 MS genes established through recent GWAS and their contribution to the development of MS and disease expression (Aim 1). Next, we will also comprehensively investigate a number of important life-course exposures including prenatal, perinatal, childhood, adolescent and adult time periods, GxE interactions and risk of MS (Aim 2). Finally, we will study genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a newly established cohort of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS)/early MS cases and matched controls to identify immune cell specific epigenetic influences on the development of MS (Aim 3). We will utilize extraordinary MS case-control resources nested within the large, population-based membership of Northern California Kaiser Permanente, as well as DNA, genetic and clinical data assembled for this project through the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium; more than 10,000 individuals of White/European ancestry will be studied using a suite of statistical methods of analysis. Results from proposed epidemiologic studies of the most important MS genes and causal variants in the context of relevant environmental exposures will inform new functional studies, and have potential to support the development of more effective approaches for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.            The complete identification of genetic and environmental influences and how they contribute independently and jointly to the development of MS and expression of particular disease characteristics would play a major role in understanding disease etiology, and would contribute greatly to disease prevention strategies and development of targeted and more effective therapies.         ",Novel Strategies to Identify GxE Contributions to MS Pathogenesis,8207321,R01ES017080,"['6p21', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'California', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Childhood', 'Chromosomes', 'Chronology', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'MHC Class II Genes', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention strategy', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disease characteristic', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'effective therapy', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'prenatal', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2011,643215,0.041618990814153434
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary: Mass spectrometry, the core technology in the field of proteomics, promises to enable scientists to identify and quantify the entire complement of molecules that comprise a complex biological sample. In the biological and health sciences, mass spectrometry is commonly used in a nigh-throughput fashion to identify proteins in a mixture. Currently, the primary bottleneck in this type of experiment is computational. Existing algorithms for interpreting mass spectra are slow and fail to identify a large proportion of the given spectra. We propose to apply techniques and tools from the field of machine learning to the analysis of mass spectrometry data. We will build computational models of peptide fragmentation within the mass spectrometer, as well as larger-scale models of the entire mass spectrometry process. Using these models, we will design and validate algorithms for identifying the set of proteins that best explain an observed set of spectra. Software implementations for all of the methods will be made publicly available in a user-friendly form.

"Analysis of LC-MS data to identify peptide and glycan biomarkers for hepatocellul    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of cancer improves patient survival. Characterizing the association of peptides and glycans with cancer is one of the most promising strategies to discover early-diagnosis cancer biomarkers. This study evaluates peptide and glycan expression profiles in the progression of chronic liver disease (CLD) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by using the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The goal is to find and validate peptide and glycan biomarkers for detection of HCC at a treatable stage in a high-risk population of patients with CLD. Label-free LC-MS quantification allows comparison of peptides and glycans with good throughput which allows us to compare a large population of patients. However, such quantification is not addressed adequately in the instrument-specific software packages. In particular, alignment and normalization of LC-MS data present a significant challenge in label-free quantification and comparison of biomolecules. This challenge coupled with biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human populations has restricted recent advances in LC-MS-based biomarker discovery studies. This project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry to develop a suite of novel analytical tools for LC-MS-based label-free quantification and comparison of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma. Specifically, a novel Bayesian hierarchical model will be investigated for simultaneous alignment and normalization of LC-MS data and for identification of patient subgroups. The Bayesian framework involves fixed and random effects to account for subpopulation homogeneous behavior (fixed systematic changes), while allowing for modeling heterogeneity within a group (random effects). A spike-in study will be conducted to obtain replicate LC-MS runs with known peptide and glycan concentrations. The data will be utilized to develop and optimize the proposed Bayesian framework and to compare its performance with other existing solutions. The optimized framework and a machine learning-based feature selection method will be applied to identify an integrated set of peptide and glycan candidate biomarkers for early detection of HCC. LC-MS analysis of integrated peptides and glycans in both serum and plasma of patients with HCC is to our knowledge unprecedented. Blood samples from patients with HCC and CLD controls in Egypt and United States will be used. The biomarkers will be validated using isotope dilution mass spectrometric assays.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies. The availability of such tools will assist the research community in advancing the promising LC-MS-based biomarker discovery research. The proposed tools will be utilized to find and validate early-diagnosis biomarkers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of patients with chronic liver disease has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients are diagnosed at a late stage, where the treatment options are limited. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.              PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will lead to the development of a suite of novel open source analytical tools for label-free quantification of peptides and glycans in serum and plasma using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technologies.

"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients.

"Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to develop a non-invasive procedure for the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The specific goal of the studies proposed in this application is to identify urinary polypeptides that can be used as biomarkers of IgAN. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated elevated levels of IgA and IgG immunoglobulins and IgA-IgG complexes in the urine of IgAN patients using immune complex-specific ELISA. Furthermore, we have identified several potential urinary polypeptide biomarkers for IgAN by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and sequenced some of these polypeptides using tandem mass spectrometry. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the urine proteome of IgAN patients contains disease-specific biomarkers. We propose to test this hypothesis by first confirming our preliminary data through analysis of archival urine samples collected during studies of IgAN from well-characterized patients and controls. We will determine the levels of immunoglobulins and immune complexes using classical and immune complex-specific ELISA protocols with quality assurance and verification by western blot analysis. These data will then be extended by analysis using CE-MS to identify positive and negative biomarkers of disease in which the software tool, MosaCluster, with support vector machines, will be used for classification of samples. This approach will define a membership, with positive values (disease-associated marker) and negative values (marker for normal). The results of ELISA and CE-MS will be compared and correlated with the clinical findings. Candidate biomarkers identified by CE-MS will be further characterized by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance MS to define the amino acid sequence and post- translational modifications. Finally, candidate biomarkers will be verified using an independent cohort of patients and controls. This study is designed to identify markers that can be used to distinguish IgAN from other renal diseases as well as biomarkers of disease progression and severity. Relevance: IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Currently, diagnosis requires an invasive renal biopsy and IgAN is frequently diagnosed at a very late stage.

"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary: Mass spectrometry, the core technology in the field of proteomics, promises to enable scientists to identify and quantify the entire complement of molecules that comprise a complex biological sample. In the biological and health sciences, mass spectrometry is commonly used in a nigh-throughput fashion to identify proteins in a mixture. Currently, the primary bottleneck in this type of experiment is computational. Existing algorithms for interpreting mass spectra are slow and fail to identify a large proportion of the given spectra. We propose to apply techniques and tools from the field of machine learning to the analysis of mass spectrometry data. We will build computational models of peptide fragmentation within the mass spectrometer, as well as larger-scale models of the entire mass spectrometry process. Using these models, we will design and validate algorithms for identifying the set of proteins that best explain an observed set of spectra. Software implementations for all of the methods will be made publicly available in a user-friendly form. In practical terms, this software will enable scientists to more easily, efficiently and accurately analyze and understand their mass spectrometry data.

"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7628516,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2009,329306,0.12679967750785873

"Proteomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HYPOTHESIS: Central nervous system dysfunction is a central pathogenic mechanism in the CFS spectrum of illnesses. Cerebrospinal fluid provides a ""window"" into potential dysfunctional regulatory, innate immune, and neurological pathways. Neurons, glial cells, epithelial choroid plexus and leptomeningeal cells may be sources of CFS-related proteins. Despite the diverse clinical syndromes, the CFS-related proteome is the same, suggesting a unified pathogenesis. DATA: We have performed tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) on cerebrospinal fluid from CFS and healthy control subjects. Traditional and support vector machine (SVM) learning statistical analyses identified nearly identical CFS-related proteomes. A specific pattern of proteins (biosignature) predicted CFS with a significant odds ratio of 34.5 and concordance of 80%. Amyloidogenic proteins, antiproteases, Ig lambda, heme and Fe scavengers, and regulatory prohormones were associated with CFS. This is the first predictive model of CFS to be defined solely from objective data. PLAN: Recruit a new set of CFS and HC subjects (n=50 per group, ""cohort 4"") to a cross-sectional ""training-test"" study design. (A) Perform qualitative MS-MS to identify proteins in all samples of cohort 4. Train the SVM algorithm with cohort 4, then test the output ""classifier"" on an independent set of 42 samples (cohort 3). Determine the prediction accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the SVM classifier. (B) Perform quantitative MS-MS on pooled CFS and pooled control samples by labeling one with O16 and the other with O18. Mix the samples and identify peptides (and their parent proteins) with O16/O18 ratios that are significantly higher or lower in CFS than controls. (C) These CFS-related proteins will be measured using novel, high sensitivity, luciferase- fusion protein competition immunoassays. Significant concentrations differences between CFS and control and between the 2 cohorts will define protein biomarkers and their sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy. (D) Subjective psychometric and other input variables will be tested by SVM learning to define a highly predictive model of CFS.

"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7846704,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'base', 'blind', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein profiling', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2009,19341,0.07311292447684026
"Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of acquired neurological dysfunction during early and mid adulthood, and affects more than one million people in North America and Western Europe. Compelling data indicate that susceptibility and resistance to MS is partly inherited. The presence of brain inflammation, loss of myelin and neuro-axonal degeneration are hallmarks of the disease. However, the link between these pathological processes remains unknown. An emerging concept bridging this knowledge gap is the alteration of glutamate metabolism causing toxicity of the central nervous system. Clinically, the vast majority of MS patients will experience progressive worsening a decade after onset of the disease. The main goal of this study is to determine the level of brain glutamate in patients with MS using a novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging technique. This non-invasive in vivo methodology provides, for the first time, an estimate of glutamate levels over large brain regions of interest. Specifically, the authors hypothesized that an excess of glutamate levels in MS patient brains is a predictor of neuronal injury, brain atrophy and accumulation of chronic clinical disability. Lastly, the effort will focus on the discovery of patterns of gene expression in the peripheral blood of MS patients through the combined use of state-of- the-art genome wide analysis and molecular biology experimental tools to predict sustained disability progression of MS patients. The authors will use unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms to capture relationships between gene expression levels and disease progression.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.           PROJECT NARRATIVE The identification of specific molecular imaging and genetic predictive markers associated with disease progression of MS patients will accelerate advances in research and lead to better therapeutic strategies to prevent the biological process leading to brain inflammation, demyelination, axonal injury and consequent progressive neurological deficits.",Molecular and Genetic Predictors of Disability Progression in MS,7783946,R01NS062885,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Build-it', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'DLG1 gene', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demyelinations', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Encephalitis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutamate Metabolism Pathway', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motivation', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Myelin', 'N-acetylaspartate', 'Network-based', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neuronal Injury', 'North America', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Receptor Gene', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specimen', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Western Europe', 'axonal degeneration', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'cerebral atrophy', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide analysis', 'gray matter', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time interval', 'tool', 'white matter']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2009,275625,0.06487109646225746
"Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mass spectrometry (MS) has the promise to provide a noninvasive screening mechanism on easily accessible fluids such as plasma, serum, and urine. The characterization of peptides in these biological fluids is one of the promising strategies for biomarker discovery. However, peptide profiles obtained through current mass spectrometric methods are characterized by their high dimensionality and complex patterns with substantial amount of noise. The presence of biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human samples from diverse populations adds to the complexity of the problem. Thus, in addition to innovative analytical methods desired for sample preparation, peptide identification, and validation, robust computational methods are needed for optimal selection of useful peptidic markers. This collaborative project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, proteomics, and mass spectrometry to develop analytical tools that address the above challenges. The specific aims are the following: (1) To develop fuzzy logic based methods to detect and calibrate MS peaks. Our peak detection method will identify peaks in a way that is consistent with peaks detected manually by MS experts. Peaks will be calibrated to accommodate isotopic distributions and machine drifts. (2) To investigate machine learning- based peak selection methods that take into account biological variability and disease heterogeneity of the human population. Spike-in and simulation studies will be conducted to obtain spectra whose true inputs are known. The spectra from these studies will be used to optimize our peak detection/calibration and selection methods, and compare the methods with other existing solutions. The optimized analytical tools will be applied to find and validate markers that detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. Serum samples collected from cirrhotic and HCC patients as well as healthy controls in Egypt, United States, and Thailand will be used in this study. Mass spectra will be generated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS of enriched low molecular weight (LMW) serum fractions of the samples. From these spectra, the most useful panel of peaks will be identified using the proposed peak detection, calibration, and selection methods. The selected peaks will be sequenced to identify the peptides they represent. Finally, the identity of the peptides and their ability to detect HCC will be examined using isotope dilution by synthesizing 13C-labeled peptide standards. The synergetic interaction of diverse disciplines contributes to the intellectual merit of this project, leading to analytical tools that will make scientific knowledge discovery more efficient. Analytical tools developed in this project will be useful for other biomarker discovery studies, where the analysis of high-dimensional mass spectral data is needed. The tools will be freely available (open source) to mass spectrometry users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Development of a diagnostic test would be of great benefit for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. In particular, defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of cirrhotic patients has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients present with advanced-stage disease and poor prognosis. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. This project will lead to the development of analytical tools to find and validate early-diagnosis candidate peptide biomarkers from high- dimensional MALDI-TOF spectra of low-molecular-weight serum fractions. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.          n/a",Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can,7640849,R21CA130837,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Egypt', 'Ensure', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular Weight', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Radial', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'design', 'disease classification', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,207225,0.16412616709220249
"Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our ultimate goal is to develop a non-invasive procedure for the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN). The specific goal of the studies proposed in this application is to identify urinary polypeptides that can be used as biomarkers of IgAN. In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated elevated levels of IgA and IgG immunoglobulins and IgA-IgG complexes in the urine of IgAN patients using immune complex-specific ELISA. Furthermore, we have identified several potential urinary polypeptide biomarkers for IgAN by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS) and sequenced some of these polypeptides using tandem mass spectrometry. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the urine proteome of IgAN patients contains disease-specific biomarkers. We propose to test this hypothesis by first confirming our preliminary data through analysis of archival urine samples collected during studies of IgAN from well-characterized patients and controls. We will determine the levels of immunoglobulins and immune complexes using classical and immune complex-specific ELISA protocols with quality assurance and verification by western blot analysis. These data will then be extended by analysis using CE-MS to identify positive and negative biomarkers of disease in which the software tool, MosaCluster, with support vector machines, will be used for classification of samples. This approach will define a membership, with positive values (disease-associated marker) and negative values (marker for normal). The results of ELISA and CE-MS will be compared and correlated with the clinical findings. Candidate biomarkers identified by CE-MS will be further characterized by Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance MS to define the amino acid sequence and post- translational modifications. Finally, candidate biomarkers will be verified using an independent cohort of patients and controls. This study is designed to identify markers that can be used to distinguish IgAN from other renal diseases as well as biomarkers of disease progression and severity. Relevance: IgAN is the most common primary glomerulonephritis worldwide. Currently, diagnosis requires an invasive renal biopsy and IgAN is frequently diagnosed at a very late stage. The identification of biomarkers that can be used as the basis of a noninvasive diagnostic test and/or used to monitor the course of the disease would be extremely beneficial.       n/a",Urinary Polypeptide Biomarkers of IgA Nephropathy,7386943,R21DK075868,"['Alabama', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Circulation', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complement Membrane Attack Complex', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Evaluation', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Future', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Glycopeptides', 'Goals', 'IgA1', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Patients', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Sampling', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Western Blotting', 'base', 'cohort', 'complement C3 precursor', 'design', 'glycosylation', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'molecular mass', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'polypeptide', 'programs', 'quality assurance', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2009,219500,0.004926583111695686
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary: Mass spectrometry, the core technology in the field of proteomics, promises to enable scientists to identify and quantify the entire complement of molecules that comprise a complex biological sample. In the biological and health sciences, mass spectrometry is commonly used in a nigh-throughput fashion to identify proteins in a mixture. Currently, the primary bottleneck in this type of experiment is computational. Existing algorithms for interpreting mass spectra are slow and fail to identify a large proportion of the given spectra. We propose to apply techniques and tools from the field of machine learning to the analysis of mass spectrometry data. We will build computational models of peptide fragmentation within the mass spectrometer, as well as larger-scale models of the entire mass spectrometry process. Using these models, we will design and validate algorithms for identifying the set of proteins that best explain an observed set of spectra. Software implementations for all of the methods will be made publicly available in a user-friendly form. In practical terms, this software will enable scientists to more easily, efficiently and accurately analyze and understand their mass spectrometry data.

"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7367013,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2008,77600,0.0911869962460945
"Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary purpose of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the means and structures for achieving two goals; (1) to develop intelligent computational aids for mining proteomic data accumulating from high throughput techniques like SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry; and (2) the long-term goal is to gain independence as a biomedical informatics researcher by developing methodological expertise in Bayesian methods and proteomic technologies. Applicant will obtain further instruction in probabilistic methods of data analysis; and she will receive education on proteomic technologies that are driving today's proteome research. Training will be provided through formal coursework, directed readings, seminars and conferences in addition to research directed by excellent mentors.  Applicant's research project involves a novel combination of techniques for use in proteomic data analysis. Previous research has included the use of techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks for analysis of proteomic data. These techniques were not explicitly designed to take into account background and prior knowledge. Hypothesis of this project is that background knowledge and machine learning techniques can positively influence the selection of appropriate biomarkers from proteomic data, enabling efficient and accurate analysis of massive datasets arising from proteomic profiling studies. Therefore, this project will satisfy four aims: (1) development of a wrapper-based machine learning tool; (2) augment the tool with prior knowledge such as heuristic rules and relationships in the data; (3) use these features along with de-identified patient information as input to classification systems; and (4) evaluate existing techniques for interpreting tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS or MS/MS) data, and propose, implement and evaluate a Bayesian method for identification of peptides and proteins indicated by the MS-MS spectrum. n/a",Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining,7460715,K25GM071951,"['Accounting', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Purpose', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrometry', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Today', 'Training', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'data mining', 'design', 'heuristics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'symposium', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K25,2008,132674,0.07555905844429646
"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification. In particular, the project will develop methods for internally calibrating spectra, and will learn fragmentation patterns that can statistically distinguish different types of glycosidic linkages.         n/a",High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra,7431760,R01GM074128,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Carbon', 'Cartoons', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Class', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disclosure', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Genomics', 'Glycoproteins', 'Goals', 'Graft Rejection', 'Human Genome', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monosaccharides', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Occupations', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Polysaccharides', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Range', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Title', 'Training', 'Work', 'cancer cell', 'egg', 'enzyme activity', 'experience', 'glycosylation', 'glycosyltransferase', 'high throughput analysis', 'immune function', 'improved', 'novel', 'programs', 'prototype', 'sperm cell', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIGMS,PALO ALTO RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2008,329296,0.12679967750785873
"Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Shotgun proteomics is one of the most commonly used approaches to MS-based biomarker discovery, due to its high throughput and sensitivity. The general strategy involves simultaneous protease digestion of all proteins in a mixture, liquid chromatography-based separation of peptides and analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to produce fragmentation spectra of each peptide. Each experimental spectrum is searched against a protein database. Sequences that best match the experimental spectra are considered identified, while a set of reliably identified peptides from the same protein is necessary for a reliable protein identification. The main goal in the proposed work is to generate and interrogate MS/MS data from several proteomics platforms, including ESI/MS, MALDI/TOF/TOF, LC-IMS/TOF and MALDI-PID/TOF to develop customized computational tools that address several challenging problems in shotgun proteomics data analysis: peptide identification, protein identification and label-free protein quantification. Our proposed approach is data-driven. At its core is the application of machine learning methods to the prediction of peptide fragmentation spectra as well as the likelihood of peptide detection in a typical proteomics experiment. Improved peptide identification coupled with the predicted peptide delectability will then be used to develop new methods for improved protein identification and quantification. The methods proposed herein will be extensively evaluated and software will be made public both as web-based tools and open-source deliverables. These software tools will enable researchers using proteomics technologies to more effectively and efficiently study a variety of health related conditions. Such studies might entail disease diagnosis (biomarker discovery), disease progression (tissue profiling), or effects of treatment (drug-induced proteome changes). These studies will enhance understanding of diseases and hasten the development of effective treatments and cures. In addition, these tools will be useful in characterizing new analytical tools for proteome analysis. Here we propose to develop and extensively evaluate computational methodology that will be used to improve the interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry data. These software tools will enable researchers using proteomics technologies to more effectively and efficiently study a variety of health related conditions. Such studies that might entail disease diagnosis, disease progression, or effects of treatment, will enhance understanding of diseases and hasten the development of effective treatments and cures.          n/a",Computational approaches to protein identification and quantification using MS/MS,7387128,R01RR024236,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Condition', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease regression', 'Endopeptidases', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Informatics', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Numerical value', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Problem Formulations', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Shotguns', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trypsin', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'concept', 'design', 'improved', 'open source', 'programs', 'research study', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NCRR,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R01,2008,267731,0.12159815227369837
"Proteomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HYPOTHESIS: Central nervous system dysfunction is a central pathogenic mechanism in the CFS spectrum of illnesses. Cerebrospinal fluid provides a ""window"" into potential dysfunctional regulatory, innate immune, and neurological pathways. Neurons, glial cells, epithelial choroid plexus and leptomeningeal cells may be sources of CFS-related proteins. Despite the diverse clinical syndromes, the CFS-related proteome is the same, suggesting a unified pathogenesis. DATA: We have performed tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) on cerebrospinal fluid from CFS and healthy control subjects. Traditional and support vector machine (SVM) learning statistical analyses identified nearly identical CFS-related proteomes. A specific pattern of proteins (biosignature) predicted CFS with a significant odds ratio of 34.5 and concordance of 80%. Amyloidogenic proteins, antiproteases, Ig lambda, heme and Fe scavengers, and regulatory prohormones were associated with CFS. This is the first predictive model of CFS to be defined solely from objective data. PLAN: Recruit a new set of CFS and HC subjects (n=50 per group, ""cohort 4"") to a cross-sectional ""training-test"" study design. (A) Perform qualitative MS-MS to identify proteins in all samples of cohort 4. Train the SVM algorithm with cohort 4, then test the output ""classifier"" on an independent set of 42 samples (cohort 3). Determine the prediction accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the SVM classifier. (B) Perform quantitative MS-MS on pooled CFS and pooled control samples by labeling one with O16 and the other with O18. Mix the samples and identify peptides (and their parent proteins) with O16/O18 ratios that are significantly higher or lower in CFS than controls. (C) These CFS-related proteins will be measured using novel, high sensitivity, luciferase- fusion protein competition immunoassays. Significant concentrations differences between CFS and control and between the 2 cohorts will define protein biomarkers and their sensitivity, specificity and predictive accuracy. (D) Subjective psychometric and other input variables will be tested by SVM learning to define a highly predictive model of CFS. The subjective results and objective proteomic results will also be analyzed to determine if the biomarkers are highly correlated with fatigue, systemic hyperalgesia, or other components of the CFS spectrum of illness. These methods and biomarkers may be of diagnostic value. They will be useful for assessing longitudinal changes in disease severity, phenotype, or the effects of treatment.           n/a",Proteomics of Cerebrospinal Fluid in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome,7447344,R01ES015382,"['Affective', 'Age', 'Albumins', 'Algorithms', 'Ally', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Cells', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Fatigue Syndrome', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Control Groups', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Epithelial', 'Fatigue', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Gulf War', 'Heme', 'Hyperalgesia', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Luciferases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurohormones', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Dysfunctions', 'Neurons', 'Odds Ratio', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Persian Gulf', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Secretion', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Psychometrics', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Urea', 'cohort', 'healthy aging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prohormone', 'response', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'treatment effect']",NIEHS,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,366587,0.051596675509235516
"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7501971,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Numbers', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Wasting Syndrome', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2008,136830,0.07311292447684026
"Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mass spectrometry (MS) has the promise to provide a noninvasive screening mechanism on easily accessible fluids such as plasma, serum, and urine. The characterization of peptides in these biological fluids is one of the promising strategies for biomarker discovery. However, peptide profiles obtained through current mass spectrometric methods are characterized by their high dimensionality and complex patterns with substantial amount of noise. The presence of biological variability and disease heterogeneity in human samples from diverse populations adds to the complexity of the problem. Thus, in addition to innovative analytical methods desired for sample preparation, peptide identification, and validation, robust computational methods are needed for optimal selection of useful peptidic markers. This collaborative project brings together experts in bioinformatics, biostatistics, proteomics, and mass spectrometry to develop analytical tools that address the above challenges. The specific aims are the following: (1) To develop fuzzy logic based methods to detect and calibrate MS peaks. Our peak detection method will identify peaks in a way that is consistent with peaks detected manually by MS experts. Peaks will be calibrated to accommodate isotopic distributions and machine drifts. (2) To investigate machine learning- based peak selection methods that take into account biological variability and disease heterogeneity of the human population. Spike-in and simulation studies will be conducted to obtain spectra whose true inputs are known. The spectra from these studies will be used to optimize our peak detection/calibration and selection methods, and compare the methods with other existing solutions. The optimized analytical tools will be applied to find and validate markers that detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. Serum samples collected from cirrhotic and HCC patients as well as healthy controls in Egypt, United States, and Thailand will be used in this study. Mass spectra will be generated using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS of enriched low molecular weight (LMW) serum fractions of the samples. From these spectra, the most useful panel of peaks will be identified using the proposed peak detection, calibration, and selection methods. The selected peaks will be sequenced to identify the peptides they represent. Finally, the identity of the peptides and their ability to detect HCC will be examined using isotope dilution by synthesizing 13C-labeled peptide standards. The synergetic interaction of diverse disciplines contributes to the intellectual merit of this project, leading to analytical tools that will make scientific knowledge discovery more efficient. Analytical tools developed in this project will be useful for other biomarker discovery studies, where the analysis of high-dimensional mass spectral data is needed. The tools will be freely available (open source) to mass spectrometry users. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Development of a diagnostic test would be of great benefit for detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a treatable stage. In particular, defining clinically applicable biomarkers that detect early-stage HCC in a high-risk population of cirrhotic patients has potentially far-reaching consequences for disease management and patient health. This project is important because most HCC patients present with advanced-stage disease and poor prognosis. There is a pressing need to identify biomarkers of HCC that could be used for early detection and more accurate classification of disease. This project will lead to the development of analytical tools to find and validate early-diagnosis candidate peptide biomarkers from high- dimensional MALDI-TOF spectra of low-molecular-weight serum fractions. In addition to screening high-risk populations for early signs of disease, the resulting biomarkers could be used to design and test improved treatment strategies.          n/a",Peptide Biomarker Discovery by Mass Spectrometry for Early Detection of Liver Can,7531854,R21CA130837,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Commit', 'Complex', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Egypt', 'Ensure', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Linguistics', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Molecular Weight', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Screening for Hepatocellular Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Shoulder', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'design', 'desire', 'disease classification', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'radius bone structure', 'research study', 'simulation', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,172688,0.16412616709220249
"Accurate Protein Identification using Peptide Separation Information and Tandem M    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A significant problem currently hindering proteomics studies is the identification of peptides and proteins from mass spectral data. This problem is manifest in the difficulty to establish confidence limits of protein and peptide identifications. A serious concern is the tendency for the occurrence of false positive assignments. The development of an integrated protein identification platform will greatly reduce the risk of such assignments. This will allow Predictive Physiology and Medicine, Inc. (PPM) to produce unrivaled characterizations of the proteins in human plasma. With this capability, PPM will be able to perform the population studies necessary to create the protein profiles associated with health and disease, termed Addressable Digital Array Maps (ADAM). The ability to distinguish healthy and disease ADAMs will greatly enhance the competitiveness of PPM in the field of personalized medicine. Additionally, the platform itself will be marketable.       The integrated protein identification platform will be created using information that is generally discarded in typical liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry experiments (LC-MS). Algorithms will be developed aimed at predicting peptide separation profiles for two-dimensional (2D) ion mobility spectrometry (IMS, a technology currently only utilized by PPM for proteomics studies). The predicted profiles can be used to decrease protein database sizes which decrease the identity thresholds for assignments; effectively this increases the confidence of peptide assignments as well as increases the number of confident assignments. Additionally, algorithms will be developed to allow the use of multiple protein database search programs. A scoring scheme will be developed based on the union and intersection of resulting assignments. Finally, the algorithms and predictive capabilities will be combined in a single integrated system to determine an accurate p-value for protein assignments which are entered into the ADAMs.The development of the integrated protein identification platform will have a substantial impact on the field of personalized medicine. Such a platform will enable the development of unprecedented plasma protein databases that can be used to determine the disease susceptibility and therapeutic response of different individuals.          n/a",Accurate Protein Identification using Peptide Separation Information and Tandem M,7405508,R41RR024306,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Businesses', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Numbers', 'Peptides', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Phosphorylation', 'Physiology', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Population Study', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Preventive', 'Protein Databases', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Range', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Score', 'Set protein', 'Simulate', 'Solid', 'Spectrometry', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparative', 'digital', 'glycosylation', 'innovation', 'ion mobility', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'mathematical model', 'millisecond', 'practical application', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'size', 'software development', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NCRR,"PREDICTIVE PHYSIOLOGY AND MEDICINE, INC.",R41,2008,149711,0.08835802846558609
"Machine learning analysis of tandem mass spectra    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project summary: Mass spectrometry, the core technology in the field of proteomics, promises to enable scientists to identify and quantify the entire complement of molecules that comprise a complex biological sample. In the biological and health sciences, mass spectrometry is commonly used in a nigh-throughput fashion to identify proteins in a mixture. Currently, the primary bottleneck in this type of experiment is computational. Existing algorithms for interpreting mass spectra are slow and fail to identify a large proportion of the given spectra. We propose to apply techniques and tools from the field of machine learning to the analysis of mass spectrometry data. We will build computational models of peptide fragmentation within the mass spectrometer, as well as larger-scale models of the entire mass spectrometry process. Using these models, we will design and validate algorithms for identifying the set of proteins that best explain an observed set of spectra. Software implementations for all of the methods will be made publicly available in a user-friendly form. In practical terms, this software will enable scientists to more easily, efficiently and accurately analyze and understand their mass spectrometry data.

"Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cancer worldwide with as many as 500,000 new cases each year. Between 1981 to 1998, the 5-year patient survival rate with HCC only rose from 2% to 5%. This poor survival rate is in part related to the diagnosis of HCC at advanced stages, where effective therapies are lacking. Early detection of HCC improves patient survival. Patients with cirrhosis are typically the ones to develop HCC. Hence, monitoring cirrhotic patients can potentially decrease the cancer-related mortality rate. The poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available tools has prevented widespread implementation of HCC surveillance. Therefore, additional serum markers that provide higher sensitivity and specificity are needed to improve the detection rate of early HCC. The goal of this collaborative project is to identify a panel of serum biomarkers for early diagnosis of HCC. The long-term goal is to find and validate markers that would help identify HCC at a treatable stage in high-risk population of cirrhotic patients. This project will lead to the development of innovative mass spectral data preprocessing and biomarker selection methods that for the identification of candidate biomarkers specific to HCC by using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) of low-molecular-weight (LMW) enriched sera. The specific aims of the project are the following: Aim 1: To develop algorithms for improved MALDI-TOF mass spectral data preprocessing including outlier screening, binning, smoothing, baseline correction, normalization, peak detection, and peak calibration. The proposed algorithms will enable us to reduce run-to-run variability in replicate spectra of a standard serum and to enhance the prediction accuracy in distinguishing HCC patients from cirrhotic patients or healthy individuals. Aim 2: To develop a novel algorithm that is superior to currently used biomarker selection methods by combining two popular machine learning methods, particle swarm optimization (PSO) and support vector machines (SVMs). The proposed algorithm will be used to identify HCC-specific markers from the preprocessed MALDI-TOF spectra. To avoid confounding effects, peaks will be removed prior to biomarker selection if they are associated with viral infection or covariates such as age, gender, smoking status, drinking status, and residency (urban or rural). From the remaining peaks, a small set of candidate biomarkers that accurately distinguishes HCC patients from cirrhotic patients will be identified. The capability of the algorithm to identify a small set of markers with high sensitivity and specificity is critical for establishment of clinical tests. Additionally, the algorithm will identify markers that distinguish various pairs (normal vs. cirrhosis, normal vs. HCC, cirrhosis vs. early-stage HCC, and cirrhosis vs. late-stage HCC). This will enable us to isolate HCC- specific markers and identify disease progression markers. Furthermore, the peptides represented by the selected candidate biomarkers will be identified. Finally, the performance of the algorithm will be compared with existing methods.           n/a",Novel Machine Learning Methods for Analysis of MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Data,7265522,R03CA119313,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calibration', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Figs - dietary', 'Gender', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logistic Regressions', 'MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical Surveillance', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Weight', 'Monitor', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Proteins', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Rosa', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Smoking Status', 'Spectrometry', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'base', 'drinking', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mass spectrometer', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology', 'particle', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NCI,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,R03,2007,77600,0.0911869962460945
"Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary purpose of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the means and structures for achieving two goals; (1) to develop intelligent computational aids for mining proteomic data accumulating from high throughput techniques like SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry; and (2) the long-term goal is to gain independence as a biomedical informatics researcher by developing methodological expertise in Bayesian methods and proteomic technologies. Applicant will obtain further instruction in probabilistic methods of data analysis; and she will receive education on proteomic technologies that are driving today's proteome research. Training will be provided through formal coursework, directed readings, seminars and conferences in addition to research directed by excellent mentors.  Applicant's research project involves a novel combination of techniques for use in proteomic data analysis. Previous research has included the use of techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks for analysis of proteomic data. These techniques were not explicitly designed to take into account background and prior knowledge. Hypothesis of this project is that background knowledge and machine learning techniques can positively influence the selection of appropriate biomarkers from proteomic data, enabling efficient and accurate analysis of massive datasets arising from proteomic profiling studies. Therefore, this project will satisfy four aims: (1) development of a wrapper-based machine learning tool; (2) augment the tool with prior knowledge such as heuristic rules and relationships in the data; (3) use these features along with de-identified patient information as input to classification systems; and (4) evaluate existing techniques for interpreting tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS or MS/MS) data, and propose, implement and evaluate a Bayesian method for identification of peptides and proteins indicated by the MS-MS spectrum. n/a",Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining,7254755,K25GM071951,"['Accounting', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Method', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Purpose', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Spectrometry', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Today', 'Training', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'data mining', 'design', 'heuristics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'symposium', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K25,2007,130068,0.07555905844429646
"Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The information required for adequate diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers is so complex that a panel of measurements, used in sum, may provide the best answers. The concept is embodied in SELDI-TOF mass spectrometric (MS) peptide profiling, an emerging technique for serum based cancer detection. Even though SELDI has thus far only produced low complexity spectra, the patterns, when analyzed as groups, have the potential to create learning algorithms with diagnostic accuracies as good as or better than conventional biomarkers. We have developed a system to capture peptides on magnetic reversed-phase beads, followed by MALDI-TOF MS, to yield increasingly complex, yet very reproducible patterns. This has clear advantages, as more displayed peptides provide more opportunity to select unique patterns ('barcodes') for cancer subtypes and stages, and to predict and monitor clinical outcome. Extreme care has also been taken to standardize specimen collection, handling and storage to avoid the introduction of artifact. Pilot projects at MSKCC with a variety of malignancies suggest that peptide patterns thus obtained appear to hold information that may have direct clinical utility.

"High-throughput annotation of glycan mass spectra     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The correct functioning of many proteins depends on glycosylation, the addition of sugar molecules (glycans) to selected amino acids in the protein. For example, cancer cells have different glycosylation patterns than ordinary cells, and there is strong evidence that glycoproteins on the surface of egg cells play an essential role in sperm binding. Despite the importance of glycosylation, there are as yet no reliable, high-throughput methods for determining the identity and location of glycans. Glycan identification is currently a manual procedure for experts, involving a combination of chemical assays and mass spectrometry. The automation of the process would have a significant impact on our understanding of this important biological process. The proposed project aims to invent chemical procedures, algorithms, and software for high-throughput analysis of glycan mass spectrometry data. The goal is to bring glycan analysis up to the level of peptide analysis within 3 years. In contrast to peptide analysis, which can leverage genomics data, glycan analysis requires the incorporation of expert knowledge of synthetic pathways, in order to limit the huge number of theoretical combinations of monosaccharides to the much smaller number that are actually synthesized in nature. The project will have to develop novel representations for the evolving expert knowledge, because an exhaustive list- analogous to the human genome- is not currently known. Along with expert knowledge, the project will develop and validate machine learning and statistical techniques for glycan identification.

"A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a unique family of neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system that are always fatal. Of the various forms of prion disease, those with the most impact upon human and animal health are Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), scrapie and chronic wasting disease (CWD). The outbreaks of BSE and variant CJD (vCJD) in the United Kingdom and worldwide, including the United States, has prompted the need for rapid, reliable and inexpensive screening methods that detect TSE infection in humans and live animals. Current diagnostic tests for prion disease have, thus far, focused on detection of the causal agent of the disease, the abnormal prion protein, or individual proteins that correlate with the neurological disease. These tests are inadequate because they are post-mortem, low throughput and not sufficiently sensitive to detect infection early in the pre-clinical period. Clearly, there is an urgent need for the development of a reliable, sensitive, and specific ante-mortem diagnostic test for the pre-clinical identification of TSE-infected animals or individuals. Herein we propose the development of a new highly-sensitive mass spectrometry (MS)-based analytical platform in combination with a suite of bioinformatics tools to identify a panel of biomarkers of prion disease in body fluids collected from live animals infected with prion disease during the preclinical incubation period. The guiding hypotheses of the proposed research are: (1) The pathophysiological changes associated with prion infection will result in an altered protein profile of the cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) and/or serum proteome. (2) The combination of accurate mass measurements, isotopic labeling strategy for quantitative analyses, tandem mass spectrometry, and a suite of machine-learning algorithms will provide a unique and integrated platform to identify and characterize these diagnostic protein markers with unprecedented sensitivity and specificity. (3) Characterization of these diagnostic protein biomarkers will provide a basis for the development of an ante-mortem antibody-based screening test for prion diseases in suspected animals. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims: (1) To identify a panel of candidate biomarkers in the CSF and serum of animals infected with prion diseases using MS and classification algorithms. (2) To determine the identities of the candidate biomarkers by tandem MS and to obtain global quantitative changes of putative biomarkers via isotopic labeling. (3) To validate the biomarkers in blind diagnostic trials. Collectively, the proposed study will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology. This proposal explores a novel proteomic approach combining high sensitivity mass spectrometric profiling and sequencing with a set of bioinformatics tools to discover, identify, and quantify biomarkers that are indicative of prion infection. These putative biomarkers may also serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the proposed research will provide a basis for the development of a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of prion disease in an ante-mortem sample, enhancing our ability to secure food and blood supplies, and it will also further our understanding of prion disease progression and pathology.          n/a",A Proteomic Approach to Biomarker Discovery in Prion Disease,7313388,R21AI072588,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Wasting Disease', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Creutzfeldt-Jakob Syndrome', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Trial', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Food', 'Formaldehyde', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Numbers', 'Pathology', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Prion Diseases', 'Prions', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scrapie', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Spectrometry', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Wasting Syndrome', 'base', 'blind', 'cohort', 'nervous system disorder', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2007,223880,0.07311292447684026

"Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The information required for adequate diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers is so complex that a panel of measurements, used in sum, may provide the best answers. The concept is embodied in SELDI-TOF mass spectrometric (MS) peptide profiling, an emerging technique for serum based cancer detection. Even though SELDI has thus far only produced low complexity spectra, the patterns, when analyzed as groups, have the potential to create learning algorithms with diagnostic accuracies as good as or better than conventional biomarkers. We have developed a system to capture peptides on magnetic reversed-phase beads, followed by MALDI-TOF MS, to yield increasingly complex, yet very reproducible patterns. This has clear advantages, as more displayed peptides provide more opportunity to select unique patterns ('barcodes') for cancer subtypes and stages, and to predict and monitor clinical outcome. Extreme care has also been taken to standardize specimen collection, handling and storage to avoid the introduction of artifact. Pilot projects at MSKCC with a variety of malignancies suggest that peptide patterns thus obtained appear to hold information that may have direct clinical utility. The goals of this project are to (i) automate our prototype serum peptide profiling platform and implement machine learning methods that use the resulting peptide patterns ('barcodes') for sample classification [R21]; and (ii) to test the 'barcode diagnostic' model in a high-throughput setting, using well defined and carefully observed groups of thyroid carcinoma patients [R33].

"Proteomics processing using networked instrument router* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Real-time, distributed decision-making and data-processing has become necessary as high-throughput proteomics across geographic boundaries becomes more mature. The most common instrument used to characterize and analyze proteins is the Mass Spectrometer. As more Mass Spectrometers are used in parallel to create a high-throughput proteomics system, the data processing needs grow exponentially. Using a cluster of low-cost instrument routers, developed at Userspace Corporation, the goal for this project is to divide the data processing tasks into a decision tree, which converts sequential tasking into parallel tasking or multi-threaded algorithms. These instruments can be controlled and the algorithms can independently process data in parallel or offline as they emerge in large data sets from one or many Mass Spectrometers. The First Phase of study will use an LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectroscopy) system that uses the ICAT (Isotope Coded Affinity Tags) technology developed at the lab of Dr. Ruedi Aebersold at the University of Washington (who is also the co-founder of the Institute for Systems Biology: ISB). The data from the Mass Spectrometers is analyzed using the COMET algorithm, also developed at the ISB. Userspace Corporation and ISB are collaborating on using Userspace's routers and framework in its Proteomics lab.      The first phase of this project will evaluate technologies and configuration required to process Mass Spectrometry data at the instrument level using a distributed network of the Userspace wireless instrument routers. The data will be processed in real-time as it becomes available to the router cluster and a rule-based decision matrix. The duration of this phase will be six months. The next phases would involve improving the data formatting, so that publication and data mining become science-centric and in a standardized XML (eXtensible Markup Language) representation.

"Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The information required for adequate diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of cancers is so complex that a panel of measurements, used in sum, may provide the best answers. The concept is embodied in SELDI-TOF mass spectrometric (MS) peptide profiling, an emerging technique for serum based cancer detection. Even though SELDI has thus far only produced low complexity spectra, the patterns, when analyzed as groups, have the potential to create learning algorithms with diagnostic accuracies as good as or better than conventional biomarkers. We have developed a system to capture peptides on magnetic reversed-phase beads, followed by MALDI-TOF MS, to yield increasingly complex, yet very reproducible patterns. This has clear advantages, as more displayed peptides provide more opportunity to select unique patterns ('barcodes') for cancer subtypes and stages, and to predict and monitor clinical outcome. Extreme care has also been taken to standardize specimen collection, handling and storage to avoid the introduction of artifact. Pilot projects at MSKCC with a variety of malignancies suggest that peptide patterns thus obtained appear to hold information that may have direct clinical utility. The goals of this project are to (i) automate our prototype serum peptide profiling platform and implement machine learning methods that use the resulting peptide patterns ('barcodes') for sample classification [R21]; and (ii) to test the 'barcode diagnostic' model in a high-throughput setting, using well defined and carefully observed groups of thyroid carcinoma patients [R33]. R21 aim one is to automate serum sample processing and analysis; aim two is to automate all data processing, to examine pattern selection and sample class prediction methods, and to integrate all software platforms; aim three is to develop routine MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem MS sequencing of 'barcode' peptides. R33 aim one is to define reproducibility of serum patterns in patients with  thyroid disease; aim two is to determine barcodes that can distinguish patients with thyroid cancer from those with benign thyroid nodules; aim three is to assess if serum peptidome barcodes can identify occult metastasis in a large group of thyroid cancer survivors.         n/a",Peptide Profiling Techniques to Detect Thyroid Carcinoma,6859786,R21CA111942,"['automated data processing', 'biomarker', 'biotechnology', 'blood proteins', 'carcinoma', 'clinical research', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'diagnosis quality /standard', 'high throughput technology', 'human tissue', 'matrix assisted laser desorption ionization', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'protein sequence', 'proteomics', 'robotics', 'thyroid neoplasm']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INSTITUTE FOR CANCER RES,R21,2005,143964,0.09416490796595527
"Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Primary purpose of this proposal is to provide the applicant with the means and structures for achieving two goals; (1) to develop intelligent computational aids for mining proteomic data accumulating from high throughput techniques like SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry; and (2) the long-term goal is to gain independence as a biomedical informatics researcher by developing methodological expertise in Bayesian methods and proteomic technologies. Applicant will obtain further instruction in probabilistic methods of data analysis; and she will receive education on proteomic technologies that are driving today's proteome research. Training will be provided through formal coursework, directed readings, seminars and conferences in addition to research directed by excellent mentors.  Applicant's research project involves a novel combination of techniques for use in proteomic data analysis. Previous research has included the use of techniques such as genetic algorithms and neural networks for analysis of proteomic data. These techniques were not explicitly designed to take into account background and prior knowledge. Hypothesis of this project is that background knowledge and machine learning techniques can positively influence the selection of appropriate biomarkers from proteomic data, enabling efficient and accurate analysis of massive datasets arising from proteomic profiling studies. Therefore, this project will satisfy four aims: (1) development of a wrapper-based machine learning tool; (2) augment the tool with prior knowledge such as heuristic rules and relationships in the data; (3) use these features along with de-identified patient information as input to classification systems; and (4) evaluate existing techniques for interpreting tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS or MS/MS) data, and propose, implement and evaluate a Bayesian method for identification of peptides and proteins indicated by the MS-MS spectrum. n/a",Intelligent Aids for Proteomic Data Mining,6811846,K25GM071951,"['bioinformatics', 'biomarker', 'biotechnology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'diagnosis design /evaluation', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'human data', 'mass spectrometry', 'proteomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K25,2004,122697,0.07555905844429646
"Proteomics processing using networked instrument router DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Real-time, distributed decision-making and data-processing has become necessary as high-throughput proteomics across geographic boundaries becomes more mature. The most common instrument used to characterize and analyze proteins is the Mass Spectrometer. As more Mass Spectrometers are used in parallel to create a high-throughput proteomics system, the data processing needs grow exponentially. Using a cluster of low-cost instrument routers, developed at Userspace Corporation, the goal for this project is to divide the data processing tasks into a decision tree, which converts sequential tasking into parallel tasking or multi-threaded algorithms. These instruments can be controlled and the algorithms can independently process data in parallel or offline as they emerge in large data sets from one or many Mass Spectrometers. The First Phase of study will use an LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectroscopy) system that uses the ICAT (Isotope Coded Affinity Tags) technology developed at the lab of Dr. Ruedi Aebersold at the University of Washington (who is also the co-founder of the Institute for Systems Biology: ISB). The data from the Mass Spectrometers is analyzed using the COMET algorithm, also developed at the ISB. Userspace Corporation and ISB are collaborating on using Userspace's routers and framework in its Proteomics lab.      The first phase of this project will evaluate technologies and configuration required to process Mass Spectrometry data at the instrument level using a distributed network of the Userspace wireless instrument routers. The data will be processed in real-time as it becomes available to the router cluster and a rule-based decision matrix. The duration of this phase will be six months.

The atlas will be used in commercial consultation with investigators confronted with this problem; 2) From only a receptor's primary sequence, generate completely new libraries of membrane protein-targeted, regulatory peptides; and 3) Survey these algorithmically designed new peptides for sequence dependent potentiating or inhibiting influences on natural ligand-induced physiological activity, as demonstrated by microphysiometric assays of native or receptor cDNA transfected cell systems. The resulting physiologically active, patentable peptides will be used in commercial collaboration with research laboratories searching for probes of membrane protein allosteric sites and with drug companies developing respiratory delivery systems for peptide drugs.

"Multimodal Machine-Learning and High Performance Computing Strategies for Big MS Proteomics Data Project Abstract/Summary Mass spectrometry (MS) data is high-dimensional data that is used for large-scale system biology proteomics. The current state of the art mass spectrometers can generate thousands of spectra from a single organism and experiment. This high-dimensional data is processed using database searches and denovo algorithms with varying degrees of success. The overarching objective of this study is to develop, test, integrate and evaluate novel image-processing and deep-learning algorithms that will allow us to deduce and identify reliable peptide sequences in a definitive and quantitative fashion. Our long-term goal is to improve on identification of MS based proteomics data using novel and scalable algorithms. The objective of this proposal is to investigate, design and implement machine-learning deep-learning algorithms for identification of peptides from MS data. Since deep-learning is very good at discovering intricate structures in high-dimensional data it will be ideal solution for discovering dark proteomics data and more accurate deduction of peptides. We predict that the integration of these methods, along with traditional numerical algorithms, will lead to a multimodal fusion-based approach for an optimized and accurate peptide deduction system for large-scale MS data. Further, we will design and implement data augmentation, memory-efficient indexing, and high-performance computing (HPC) to achieve these outcomes more efficiently with a shorter computational time. Therefore, this new line of investigation is significant since it has the potential to improve on long-stalled effort to increase accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of MS data analysis and search tools. The proximate expected outcome of this work is a novel set of deep-learning and image-processing tools which will allow much better insight in MS based proteomics data. The results will have an important positive impact immediately because these proposed research tasks will lay the groundwork to develop a new class of algorithms and will provide rapid, high-throughput, sensitive, and reproducible and reliable tools for MS based proteomics. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding Mass Spectrometry (MS) based proteomics can allow systematic analysis of thousands of proteins with the promise of discovering new protein biomarkers for different disease conditions and better understanding of human systems biology. Because of high-dimensionality of the big data generated from MS machines efficient, accurate and reproducible tools are required to mine and analyze the data and is the subject of this proposal. Such high-performance tools will be instrumental in elucidating the microbiome which affects virtually all aspects of human health.

"Optimization and joint modeling for peptide detection by tandem mass spectrometry Project Summary/Abstract Proteins are the primary functional molecules in living cells, and tandem mass spectrometry provides the most efﬁcient means of studying proteins in a high-throughput fashion. The proposal aims to use state-of-the-art methods from the ﬁelds of machine learning, statistics, and natural language processing to improve our ability to make sense of large tandem mass spectrometry data sets. Our project will focus on three key problems in the analysis of such data: 1. facilitating the use of previously annotated spectra to improve our ability to annotate new spectra by creating  a hybrid search scheme that compares an observed spectrum to a database comprised of theoretical spectra  and previously annotated spectra, 2. enabling the efﬁcient and accurate detection of peptides containing post-translational modiﬁcations and  sequence variants, and 3. detecting sets of peptide species that are co-fragmented in the mass spectrometer and hence give rise to  complex, mixture spectra. Each of these aims will improve the ability of mass spectrometrists to efﬁciently and accurately identify and quantify proteins in complex mixtures. To increase the impact of our work, we will continue to make all of our tools available as free software.

"Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders. Abstract: Newborn screening (NBS) using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has transformed our ability to identify and provide early, lifesaving treatment to infants with inborn errors of metabolism. While MS/MS screening identifies most affected babies, it is accompanied by frequent false-positive results that require collecting blood and urine samples for additional confirmatory testing. While DNA sequencing has become an important part of confirmatory testing, newborn dried blood spots (DBS) yield only small and highly variable DNA amounts. There is an urgent need for a more efficient second-tier NBS approach for confirming all screen-positive cases directly from the DBS cards collected at birth. This is especially critical for infants at risk for metabolic disease in their first weeks of life. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine novel DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry technology to diagnose inborn metabolic disorders from DBS, and to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of this approach for second-tier screening. To achieve this objective, the following specific aims will be pursued: (1) Develop multiplex gene sequencing (RUSPseq) and 10X linked-read sequencing for rapid genetic diagnosis without the need for additional parental testing; (2) Develop mass spectrometry (Q-TOF/LC-MS) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning to identify novel metabolic markers, which will be integrated in a novel second-tier screening panel to separate true and false-positive cases; and (3) Demonstrate clinical and translational feasibility of this approach to more rapidly identify both true and false-positive cases. We will work with the public NBS program and NBSTRN’s Pilot Research and Implementation workgroup to translate this combined approach into second-tier NBS. These outcomes will have significant impact by reducing diagnostic delays and uncertainties, and by reducing iterative testing rounds and the cost associated with them, thereby reducing the burden on the healthcare system as well as patients and their families. Project Narrative: We will establish novel genetic and metabolomic technology for newborn screening (NBS) from dried blood spots, and apply machine learning to reduce false-positive screens and delayed diagnosis of true-positive cases. Early detection and confirmation of inborn errors of metabolism that can present in the first weeks of life is critical, specifically when screening in diverse multiethnic populations where we have less understanding of the biochemical genetic and clinical phenotypes. We will work with local hospitals and the NBS program to establish clinical and translational validity to this new project, which will contribute to maintaining parental trust in public NBS.",Multiplex gene sequencing and metabolomics analysis from newborn dried blood spots to improve screening and diagnosis of metabolic disorders.,10033377,R01HD102537,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Compound Q', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Family', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Inborn Errors of Metabolism', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spottings', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Work', 'carrier status', 'case control', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'random forest', 'screening', 'screening panel', 'screening program', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'web-based tool']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542483,0.0450349997426195
"In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions. IN-SILICO PREDICTION OF PROTEIN-PEPTIDE INTERACTIONS Automated docking methods are used extensively for gaining a mechanistic understanding of the molecular interactions underpinning cellular processes. While these tools work well for small molecules they perform poorly for peptides and cannot handle Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) which play very important roles in these processes. The goal of this project is the development of an efficient and practical peptide docking software, useful for designing therapeutic peptides and gaining insight into IDPs binding ordered proteins. The proposed software supports biomedical applications ranging from investigating chemical pathways to designing and optimizing therapeutic molecules for diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. Under the previous award we developed and released a new method for docking fully-flexible peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids: AutoDock CrankPep (ADCP). We showed that it outperforms current state-of-the-art docking methods. For the next award, we propose to: 1) further develop ADCP to support docking IPDs with up to 70 amino acids and improve support for therapeutic peptides containing modified amino acids and complex macrocycles; 2) develop peptide-specific scoring functions to increase docking success rates and methods for predicting the free energy of binding of peptides. This will be done by exploiting the latest advances in statistical potentials for docking, as well as applying machine-learning techniques; 3) test and validate the software on our datasets, community benchmarks, and through our collaborations with outstanding biologists working on biomedical applications spanning from designing drugs for thrombosis and influenza, to modeling IDPs interacting with globular proteins; and 4) document the software and release it under an open source license on a regular basis along with datasets we compile and update on regularly. The proposed research will occur in the context of collaborations with experimental biologists working on highly relevant biomedical projects and providing experimental feedback and validation. In addition, this project will benefit from various collaborations with experts in the fields of computational biology, applied mathematics and artificial intelligence. This docking software tool will be developed by applying best practices in software engineering and be implemented as a modular, extensible, component-based software framework for peptide docking. This docking engine will be part of the widely used AutoDock software suite. The ability to model complexes formed by proteins and fully-flexible peptides or IDPs is in high demand and will greatly extend the range of peptide-based therapeutic approaches for which automated docking can be successfully applied. It will also support gaining insights into interactions of IDPs with proteins. As such, it will impact the research of many medicinal chemists and biologist and extend the use of computational tools to a wider community of scientists, thereby supporting the advancement of biomedical research. Automated docking is a workhorse for rational drug design, however, applying these methods to peptides has remained challenging, thus impeding the designing of therapeutic peptides and the study of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDP) binding to their ordered partners. During the prior funding period, we made substantial progress toward peptide docking, resulting in a new docking engine: AutoDock CrankPep, which outperforms state-of-the-art docking methods for linear and cyclic peptides with up to 20 standard amino acids. We propose to further develop AutoDock CrankPep to support docking of therapeutic peptides with modified amino acids as well as IDPs with up to 70 amino acids, creating a practical docking tool for peptides that will impact the research of many computational and medicinal chemists and biologist, contribute to our understanding of biological processes, and significantly advance biomedical research.",In-silico prediction of protein-peptide interactions.,10116950,R01GM096888,"['Amino Acids', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Drug Design', 'Educational workshop', 'Feedback', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Influenza', 'Insulin', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutate', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Renaissance', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Framework', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombosis', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'design', 'flexibility', 'globular protein', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'insight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'predictive tools', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'receptor', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'translational study', 'virtual screening']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,399375,0.051627882777659735
"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Mass spectrometry in combination with chromatography provides a powerful approach to characterize small molecules produced in cells, tissues and other biological systems. In essence, measured metabolites provide a functional readout of cellular state, allowing novel biological studies that advance our understanding of health and disease. Currently, the main bottleneck in metabolomics is determining the chemical identities associated with the spectral signatures of measured masses. Despite the growth of spectral databases and advances in annotation tools that recommend the chemical structure that best explains each signature, the large majority of measured masses cannot be assigned a chemical identity. There is now consensus that gleaning partial information regarding the measured spectra in terms of chemical substructure or chemical classification can inform biological studies. This consensus is reflected in the newly updated reporting standards for metabolite annotation as proposed by the Metabolite Identification Task Group of the Metabolomics Society. As we show in our Preliminary Results, spectral characterization results in “features” that can enhance performance in machine-learning tasks such as annotation.  This work aims to enhance the use and value of the metabolomics dataset in Metabolomics Workbench by: (1) developing machine-learning tools trained on this dataset to characterize unknown spectra, and (2) adding characterization information to the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. In Aim 1, we identify spectral patterns (motifs) that can represent chemically meaningful groupings of peaks within the spectra (e.g., peaks associated with aromatic substructures, loss of a substructure fragment, etc.). We utilize neural topic models that use variational inference to identify such motifs. We expect such models to offer computational speedups and to identify more chemically coherent motifs when compared to earlier implementations of topic modeling. We generate motifs across all spectra in the Metabolomics Workbench and provide annotations for each spectrum.  In Aim 2, we map spectral signatures to chemical ontology classes. As ontologies are hierarchical and as a molecule can be associated with multiple classes at different hierarchical levels of an ontology, we cast this mapping problem as a hierarchical multi-label classification problem and use neural networks to implement such a classifier. The classifier will be trained using the Metabolomics Workbench dataset. Learned motifs from Aim 1 will be used as additional input features to improve classification. We expect that the developed classifier can be used by others to elucidate measurements of unidentified molecules with chemical ontology classes, or to generate ontology terms that can be used as features in downstream machine-learning tasks. Relevance to Public Health The project proposes to investigate machine learning techniques to enhance the utility of a Common Fund data set hosted through the Metabolomics Workbench. This data set consists of biologically relevant molecules and information about their structural composition and their mass spectrometry signatures. We anticipate that our techniques will result in annotating and adding information to the data set, which in turn will advance discoveries in biomedical research and have direct benefits to human health.",Using machine learning techniques to characterize the Metabolomics Workbench Dataset,10111982,R03OD030601,"['Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatography', 'Classification', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gene Expression', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histidine', 'Human', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vocabulary', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'cost', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'neural network', 'novel', 'protein expression', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'small molecule', 'tool']",OD,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R03,2020,263120,0.07632341151966232
"Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods for metabolomics data from diverse platforms, including targeted and unbiased/global mass spectrometry (MS), labeled MS experiments for measuring metabolic ﬂux and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) platforms. Unbiased MS and NMR proﬁling studies result in identifying a large number of unnamed spectra, which cannot be directly matched to known metabolites and are hence often discarded in downstream analyses. The ﬁrst aim develops a novel kernel penalized regression method for analysis of data from unbiased proﬁling studies. It provides a systematic framework for extracting the relevant information from unnamed spectra through a kernel that highlights the similarities and differences between samples, and in turn boosts the signal from named metabolites. This results in improved power in identiﬁcation of named metabolites associated with the phenotype of interest, as well as improved prediction accuracy. An extension of this kernel-based framework is also proposed to allow for systematic integration of metabolomics data from diverse proﬁling studies, e.g. targeted and unbiased MS proﬁling technologies. The second aim pro- vides a formal inference framework for kernel penalized regression and thus complements the discovery phase of the ﬁrst aim. The third aim focuses on metabolic pathway enrichment analysis that tests both orchestrated changes in activities of steady state metabolites in a given pathway, as well as aberrations in the mechanisms of metabolic reactions. The fourth aim of the project provides a uniﬁed framework for network-based integrative analysis of static (based on mass spectrometry) and dynamic (based on metabolic ﬂux) metabolomics measurements, thus providing an integrated view of the metabolome and the ﬂuxome. Finally, the last aim implements the pro- posed methods in easy-to-use open-source software leveraging the R language, the capabilities of the Cytoscape platform and the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments in the area of metabolomics. The proposed software tool will also provide a plug-in to the Data Repository and Coordination Center (DRCC) data sets, where all regional metabolomics centers supported by the NIH Common Funds Metabolomics Program deposit curated data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Metabolomics, i.e. the study of small molecules involved in metabolism, provides a dynamic view into processes that reﬂect the actual physiology of the cell, and hence offers vast potential for detection of novel biomarkers and targeted therapies for complex diseases. However, despite this potential, the development of computational methods for analysis of metabolomics data lags the rapid growth of metabolomics proﬁling technologies. The current application addresses this need by developing novel statistical machine learning methods for integrative analysis of static and dynamic metabolomics measurements, as well as easy-to-use open-source software to facilitate the application of these methods.",Machine Learning Tools for Discovery and Analysis of Active Metabolic Pathways,9899255,R01GM114029,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Anabolism', 'Area', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equilibrium', 'Funding', 'Galaxy', 'Homeostasis', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plug-in', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'data warehouse', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diverse data', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'open source', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'small molecule', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,336869,0.1229474608951501
"Computational Techniques for Advancing Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Detecting and quantifying products of cellular metabolism using mass spectrometry (MS) has already shown great promise in biomarker discovery, nutritional analysis and other biomedical research fields. Despite recent advances in analysis techniques, our ability to interpret MS measurements remains limited. The biggest challenge in metabolomics is annotation, where measured compounds are assigned chemical identities. The annotation rates of current computational tools are low. For several surveyed metabolomics studies, less than 20% of all compounds are annotated. Another contributing factor to low annotation rates is the lack of systematic ways of designing a candidate set, a listing of putative chemical identities that can be used during annotation. Relying on exiting databases is problematic as considering the large combinatorial space of molecular arrangements, there are many biologically relevant compounds not catalogued in databases or documented in the literature. A secondary yet important challenge is interpreting the measurements to understand the metabolic activity of the sample under study. Current techniques are limited in utilizing complex information about the sample to elucidate metabolic activity. The goal of this project is to develop computational techniques to advance the interpretation of large-scale metabolomics measurements. To address current challenges, we propose to pursue three Aims: (1) Engineering candidate sets that enhance biological discovery. (2) Developing new techniques for annotation including using deep learning and incremental build out methods to recommend novel chemical structures that best explain the measurements. (3) Constructing probabilistic models to analyze metabolic activity. Each technique will be rigorously validated computationally and experimentally using chemical standards. Two detailed case studies on the intestinal microbiota will allow us to further validate our tools. Microbiota-derived metabolites have been detected in circulation and shown to engage host cellular pathways in organs and tissues beyond the digestive system. Identifying these metabolites is thus critical for understanding the metabolic function of the microbiota and elucidating their mechanisms. The complex test cases will challenge our techniques, provide feedback during development, and allow us to further disseminate our techniques. We will work closely with early adopters of our tools, as proposed in supporting letters, to further validate our tools and encourage wide adoption. All proposed tools will be open source and made accessible through the web.

"Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry PROJECT SUMMARY  Cellular interactions with the environment form the basis of health and disease for all organisms. Exposure to nutrients, toxins, and neighboring cells trigger coordinated molecular responses that impact cell function and metabolism in a beneficial, adaptive, or detrimental manner. Although the benefits of multicellularity for the formation of complex tissue structures or the function of entire organ systems has been long appreciated, it has only recently been understood that microbial inhabitants of vertebrates also have a tremendous impact on host cell function and dysfunction. Despite this, an understanding of these interactions has not moved beyond simple associations, and there are virtually no molecular technologies available that adequately define how a complex microbial ecosystem impacts host cell function, or how the host response to microbial colonization affects the bacterial community. This gap in knowledge is striking when one considers the broad and significant impact that microbes have on human health. In this application, we propose to expressly fill this knowledge gap through development of a novel multimodal imaging pipeline that will provide 3-dimensional information on the molecular heterogeneity of microbial communities and the immune response at the host-pathogen interface.  This proposal combines our expertise in immunology, infection biology, mass spectrometry, small animal imaging, machine learning, and computer vision to develop an integrated multimodal visualization method for studying infectious disease. Our unique approach will computationally combine ultra-high speed (~50px/s) MALDI-TOF images, ultra-high mass resolution (>200,000 resolving power) MALDI FTICR IMS, metal imaging by LA-ICP-IMS, high-spatial resolution optical microscopy, and MR imaging using data-driven image fusion. This strategy will enable 3-D molecular images to be generated for thousands of elements, metabolites, lipids, and proteins with an unprecedented combination of chemical specificity and spatial fidelity more than 50x faster than is currently possible. We will use this next-generation imaging capability to (i) define the heterogeneous microbial subpopulations throughout the 3-D volume of a S. aureus community, (ii) uncover the host molecules that form the abscess and accumulate to restrict microbial growth in murine models, and (iii) elucidate molecular markers that differentiate in vivo biofilms at the host-pathogen interface, between abscesses at various stages of progression, and under distinct degrees of nutrient stress. These studies will uncover new targets for therapeutic intervention and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will enable detailed views of the molecular components of infectious disease with unprecedented resolution through the development of a multimodal, 3-dimensional imaging platform. The proposed technologies will improve throughput and molecular specificity, enable automated high-precision and high-accuracy image alignment, and allow for descriptions of molecular signals in 3-D through the fusion of multi-modal imaging data. These studies will uncover targets for therapeutic intervention and antibiotic development and the techniques developed as a result of this proposal will be broadly applicable to all physiologically relevant processes, profoundly impacting biomedical research.",Molecular mapping of microbial communities at the host-pathogen interface by multi-modal 3-dimensional imaging mass spectrometry,9989025,R01AI138581,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abscess', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anterior nares', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Metabolic Process', 'Chemicals', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance', 'Functional disorder', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Biofilms', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nutrient', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Pathogenesis', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxin', 'Vertebrates', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animal imaging', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'body system', 'commensal bacteria', 'experimental study', 'host colonization', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbial community', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'protein expression', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'virtual']",NIAID,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,612684,0.026881949701824975
"Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract:  The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains challenging due to its clinical heterogeneity and lengthy differential diagnosis. The incorrect assignment of a diagnosis of MS occurs in approximately 9% of newly evaluated patients and is associated with considerable clinically important, and avoidable, medical risk, morbidity, and healthcare costs. At the same time studies have demonstrated that many patients encounter a significant diagnostic delay prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of MS. In such patients early and accurate diagnosis of MS can result in prompt initiation of disease modifying therapy and consequent preventable disability. MS remains a clinical diagnosis and diagnostic criteria for MS are revised periodically, including most recently in 2017. Since implementation of the 2017 criteria, like all prior revisions, will continue to rely on subjective clinical and radiological assessments for its fulfillment, misdiagnosis will remain a risk.  New objective, automated, and clinically applicable approaches to MS diagnosis are needed. Recent preliminary data from cross-sectional pilot studies in patients with established diagnoses have shown promise for three new radiographic and three new laboratory methods to differentiate MS from other disorders. The present study will evaluate these six methods for the first time in a prospective cohort of 125 patients undergoing an initial evaluation for MS at an academic MS subspecialty center. The specificity and sensitivity of each method will be compared to fulfillment of 2017 MS diagnostic criteria at the time of initial clinical evaluation. Using diagnostic thresholds developed from this analysis, a two year post-enrollment analysis will also be performed in participants who did not meet 2017 criteria initially but did so during the subsequent two year interval to determine if the study methods could have predicted a diagnosis of MS earlier in such patients. The use of a multimodal and machine-learning approach to evaluate the integration of each of these six new methods which represent different aspects of MS neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes will also be performed during each analysis, and such a combination of radiographic and laboratory methodology may provide superior diagnostic accuracy compared to any given method alone.  Planned collaborative career development, mentoring, and advising activities will facilitate acquisition of specific advanced quantitative and qualitative research skills necessary to develop and coordinate collection of data for this large prospective cohort study to rigorously evaluate new diagnostic methods for MS and incorporate machine learning analyses. Successful completion of this study will provide experience and skills necessary to move the field of MS diagnosis forward through a planned prospective multicenter NIH R01 funded study. Project Narrative: A highly specific, sensitive, objective and automated novel diagnostic approach to multiple sclerosis (MS) is needed maximize early benefits of disease modifying therapy in patients with MS and to prevent the frequent problem of MS misdiagnosis. This project assesses three novel MRI techniques and three novel blood tests for the diagnosis of MS in a large prospective cohort undergoing a new clinical evaluation for suspect MS. While each method may show promise alone, utilization of machine learning methodology combining these approaches that represent different aspects of MS pathophysiology may demonstrate a highly accurate and clinically applicable methodology for MS diagnosis.",Improving Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis Through the Integration of Novel Imaging and Laboratory Biomarkers,9843746,K02NS109340,"['Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Atrophic', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Tests', 'C-Peptide', 'Central Vein', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Qualitative Research', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Specificity', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Whole Blood', 'accurate diagnosis', 'career development', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'disease heterogeneity', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'neurofilament', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel imaging technique', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'specific biomarkers', 'support vector machine', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K02,2020,193783,0.06668399651407324
"Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning ABSTRACT Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious global health problem. It encompasses a spectrum of pathological conditions, ranging from simple hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, alcoholic hepatitis, to liver cirrhosis. Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. As a result, management of ALD is frequently empiric. In recent years, some progress has been made using metabolomics to identify potential biomarkers of ALD in animal models and human cohorts. However, global metabolomic profiling of ALD in humans has proceeded slowly and as of today, no studies have been performed that relate metabolomic profiles with pathological changes occurring during the development of ALD. Our working hypothesis predicts that biomarkers specific to ALD may be more effectively identified by applying integrative machine learning to the analysis of data from two state-of-the-art analytical approaches, i.e., metabolomics and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS). As such, we propose to use plasma metabolomics (Specific Aim 1), and histological analysis and liver tissue IMS (Specific Aim 2) in three mouse models of ALD (alcohol-induced steatosis, hepatitis or mild fibrosis) to gain unique insights into the feasibility of using these approaches to identify pathogenic markers of ALD. Ethanol-induced damage to the liver results in alterations in cellular function that can be documented as changes in the metabolome of biological fluids (plasma) and hepatic cells. Metabolomics, the analysis of low molecular metabolites (e.g., lipids and small molecules) in a sample, can be used to directly investigate changes in biochemical pathways induced by alcohol in the liver, such as occurs during ALD. Tissue IMS maps molecules in a tissue section, thereby allowing the quantitation of lipids, proteins and metabolites within a tissue in unprecedented detail. When interfaced with histological analysis of a paired adjacent tissue section, the cellular source of the mapped molecules may be identified. We strongly believe that the integration of metabolomics, IMS and histology (Specific Aim 3) using integrative machine learning will greatly enhance our understanding of the biochemical basis of ALD pathophysiology, and in so doing, allow the development of diagnostic tools that can be used to detect biomarkers in other forms of ALD, thereby improving early diagnosis and treatment of ALD. The management and interpretation of large metabolomics and proteomic data generated as part of the project (10-100GB of raw IMS data per single tissue section) require advanced data-analytics solutions. We will capitalize on our recently published bespoke machine learning solution (“BASIS”) for interrogation of large “-omics” data to identify metabolic/signaling pathways and their downstream metabolites disrupted in ALD. The novelty of this proposal relies on the use of cutting-edge approaches that will allow identification of novel biomarkers and their cellular sources in predictable animal models of ALD. Such information will form a basis for more effective diagnosis and prediction of the progression of ALD. Successful completion of the proposed studies will form a foundation upon which studies in human biological fluids will be conducted in the future. In addition, it is anticipated that our studies will also lay the foundation for examination of the molecular mechanisms associated with other forms of alcohol-induced tissue injury. Such knowledge will facilitate the development of more effective treatments of alcohol abuse. NARRATIVE Excessive alcohol consumption induces alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Unfortunately, no definitive diagnostic markers exist for ALD (or its different phases), and diagnosis requires a liver biopsy which itself carries significant risk. Because the early stages of ALD can potentially be reversed by sobriety, regular screening of the general population and early diagnosis are essential. The overarching goal of this application is to establish metabolomic analyses and tissue imaging mass spectrometry coupled with integrative machine learning to identify novel pathways in and biomarkers for ALD that will be applied in humans.","Identification of Biomarkers and Novel Pathways of Alcoholic Liver Disease by Leveraging Metabolomics, Tissue Imaging Mass Spectrometry, and Integrative Machine Learning",9995686,R21AA028432,"['Alcohol-Induced Disorders', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcoholic liver damage', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Ethanol', 'Fatty Liver', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Hepatitis', 'Hepatocyte', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Source', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Steatohepatitis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol research', 'biobank', 'biomarker identification', 'candidate marker', 'cohort', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effective therapy', 'global health', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'intrahepatic', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular imaging', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'protein metabolite', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'sobriety', 'specific biomarkers', 'tissue injury', 'tool']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,178842,0.058942836525298366
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods. This approach, once thoroughly validated, will enable NMR to reach wide network of applications in biomedical, pharmaceutical, and nutritional research and clinical medicine. NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop an advanced and automated platform for identifying NMR metabolomics biomarkers of diseases and for fundamental studies of biological systems. When fully developed, these approaches could be used to detect small molecules in the blood or urine, indicative of the onset of various diseases, drug toxicity, or environmental effects on the organism.",Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining,9889134,R01GM120033,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug toxicity', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Plague', 'Process', 'Regulation', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'computational suite', 'data mining', 'experimental analysis', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'infancy', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'small molecule', 'stem']",NIGMS,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,356625,0.10561524880200522
"Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years, and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein- peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve four goals: Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of freedom in peptides. Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at much lower cost. Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost. Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide leads by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. The ability to predict protein-peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. We propose to tackle the challenge of protein- peptide structure prediction, including developing the first in silico peptide screening method to dramatically save cost and time. We will screen for peptide inhibitors by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance.",Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions,9932088,R35GM136409,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Attention', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Disease', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Phage Display', 'Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'combat', 'cost', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'peptide structure', 'physical model', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'therapeutic development', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2020,391207,0.03589569800356309
"Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry The identification and quantification of biological macromolecules remains challenging despite major advances in the speed, resolution and mass accuracy of modern mass spectrometers. A key weakness with current instrumentation lies in the methods used to induce fragmentation. The reliance in particular on collision-induced dissociation (CID) has limited such analyses to bottom-up workflows of trypsin-digested peptides of 10-30 residues. At e-MSion, we have developed an efficient electron-fragmentation technology called ExD for large proteins and are now co-marketed our ExD Option with Agilent, and soon will be with Thermo and Waters instruments. What has really captured the interest of the biopharma and top-down communities in the past year is the exceptional sequence coverage of native proteins we obtain with the same ExD cell. The resulting spectra are less congested than those obtained with currently available ETD/UVPD/CID fragmentation methodologies. We have shown that our technology works faster and gives cleaner spectra with more complete dissociation with larger macromolecular protein complexes than has ever been possible before, while still preserving labile post translational modifications. In addition, fragmentation with higher energy electrons can be used to provide complementary data to improve protein and glycan identification. The challenge now has become how to optimally collect and process these data to maximize the utility of ExD fragmentation. Last summer, Xilinx released its Versal Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP), a massively parallel processor with 50 billion transistors targeted to transform digital signal processing, handling of big data and artificial intelligence. This ACAP technology has already accelerated Illumina DNA sequence assembly by 90-fold. Our feasibility question asks how to effectively harness this new highly parallelized technology to preprocess complex top-down mass spectra on- the-fly. This will allow us to actively optimize data acquisition by enabling adaptive operation of the ExD cell and mass spectrometer. The objective is to maximize both fragmentation and dissociation of native proteins, enabling faster and comprehensive characterization of challenging proteoforms important to the biopharmaceutical industry and biomedical researchers.  Success will offer an extremely fast, cost-effective solution to characterize complexes of macromolecules under native conditions with increased accuracy, speed, and fewer misidentifications. Our ExD technology with the Versal ACAP can be both retrofitted into existing mass spectrometers as well as being available in new generations of mass spectrometers at a price below other less-effective alternative fragmentation technologies like ETD and UVPD. Thus, it will provide new abilities for many NIH investigators to advance basic research, probe disease mechanisms and permit more sophisticated searches for both diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Even with all of the scientific progress made to date, the complexity of disease-affected tissues still challenges our ability to probe what makes people sick. The goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to develop a powerful computer technology to aid in characterizing biological molecules that will improve the diagnosis and treatment of diseases ranging from arthritis, cancer, diabetes to heart disease and neurodegeneration.",Real time optimization of electron-based fragmentation for middle and top-down proteomics in mass spectrometry,10081127,R43GM139467,"['Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Arthritis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Products', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Continuous Infusion', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Digital Signal Processing', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Engineering', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Ions', 'Isoleucine', 'Laboratories', 'Leucine', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Peptides', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Polysaccharides', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Price', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transistors', 'Trypsin', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vendor', 'Water', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'cost effective', 'data acquisition', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disulfide bond', 'electron energy', 'encryption', 'experience', 'fragment X', 'improved', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'mass spectrometer', 'meetings', 'operation', 'preservation', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'signal processing', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker']",NIGMS,"E-MSION, INC.",R43,2020,212830,0.08632990585388117
"COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS FOR PROTEOFORM IDENTIFICATION BY TOP-DOWN DATA INDEPENDENT ACQUISITION MASS SPECTROMETRY Summary Mass spectrometry-based top-down proteomics has become one of the most informative approaches in protein analysis because it provides the bird's-eye view of intact proteoforms (protein forms) generated from post-translational modifications and sequence variations. Data dependent acquisition and data independent acquisition are the two main methods in top-down mass spectrometry. The former has been the dominant one, but it has two main challenges in proteome-wide studies: low protein coverage: a regular experiment of human cells can identify only 200 – 400 proteins, and low reproducibility: a technical triplet shares only about one third of identified proteoforms. Top-down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry (TD-DIA-MS) has the potential to significantly increase protein coverage and improve reproducibility in proteome-wide studies. However, its application has been hampered by the complexity of the data and the lack of efficient software tools. To address this problem, we will propose new algorithms and machine learning models and develop the first software package for proteoform identification by TD-DIA-MS. The proposed research will be conducted by a group of researchers with complementary expertise. All the proposed algorithms will be implemented as user-friendly open source software tools. Narrative This project addresses the proteoform identification problem by top-down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry. We will propose new machine learning models and new algorithms for high-throughput proteome-wide identification of complex proteoforms with post-translational modifications and sequence variations by using top- down data independent acquisition mass spectrometry.

"Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach Project Summary: Multiple sclerosis (MS), a leading cause of disability in young and middle-aged adults, is a highly heterogeneous disease, with wide variations in clinical presentation, disease course and response to treatment. In order to personalize care in MS, it is important to harness its clinical heterogeneity and the diversity of its underlying pathology, and to develop models able to predict individual behavior of patients. Brain magnetic resonance images (MRI), acquired routinely in MS patients, contain information that reflects underlying pathophysiology, which may be brought into light through quantitative analyses. Radiomics, a technique well developed in oncology, converts routine medical images into mineable high-dimensional data that can be modeled to support clinical decision-making. The central hypothesis of the proposed project is that radiomic analysis, combined with careful feature selection and accurate modeling, can predict patient outcome and response to therapy using standard-of-care MRI in MS. Our hypothesis will be tested by leveraging existing 3-year imaging and clinical data from the CombiRx trial, a multi-center, phase-III investigation of combination therapy in 1008 relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients. We will first determine the potential for non-invasive radiomic biomarkers of disease severity in RRMS. Towards this goal, we will extract radiomic features of MS lesions from FLAIR, pre and postcontrast T1-weighted MR images using an open-source radiomic pipeline. Through appropriate feature selection, we will identify an independent radiomic feature set able to characterize individual phenotype on MRI in a selection cohort. We will then evaluate the selected features cross-sectionally to determine their efficacy in characterizing disease severity, leveraging training and validation subsets. The performance of our radiomic approach will be compared to traditional models using clinical and standard imaging markers such as lesion volume. In the second stage of this proposal, we will explore the performance of radiomic-based models to predict long-term outcome and treatment response in MS. We will build models to predict disease activity free status (DAFS) at 3 years using selected baseline radiomic features, and identify treatment response phenotypes. We will investigate and compare the performance of various machine-learning models in an unbiased manner. Finally, we will assess the effect of each therapeutic regimen on radiomic features by comparing on-treatment changes across treatment arms. This may provide evidence for treatment-specific monitoring parameters.   Project Narrative:    Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and disabling disorder of the central nervous system affecting over 1  million  individuals  in  the  United  States.  Unambiguous  and  robust  clinical  prediction  of  individual  outcome  and  treatment  response  is  deeply  needed  to  provide  personalized  medicine  to  MS  patients,  reduce disability, and minimize the burden of MS on individuals and society. Radiomics has the potential  to contribute to decision-­‐support systems in MS, by transforming routinely acquired magnetic resonance  images into mineable high-­‐dimensional data.   ",Predicting Patient Outcome in Multiple Sclerosis using a Quantitative Radiomic Approach,9979980,R03NS109715,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis', 'Risk', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'digital', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'feature selection', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'middle age', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'response', 'routine practice', 'standard of care', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,81671,0.01011945048544891
"Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms Project Summary:  Multiple sclerosis (MS) exhibits a markedly heterogeneous and unpredictable course, with a clinical spectrum ranging from very mild forms of the disease in some patients (often termed “benign MS”) to an aggressive disease course with rapid accumulation of disability in others. Furthermore, there appears to be significant inter-individual variability in the responses to the many available disease-modifying therapies (DMT). A variety of factors have been proposed to be associated with the disease course in MS, including demographics, lifestyle factors, clinical characteristics, MRI-derived measures, and elevated serum neurofilament light chain (NfL), among others. It remains unclear though if these factors are complementary or redundant in their predictive value. Moreover, there is a lack of validated tools to accurately predict, at an individual level, future inflammatory disease activity or disability worsening. This is largely due to the lack of datasets with sufficient size, breadth and representativeness. The use of electronic medical records (EMR) has dramatically increased in recent years, enabling the capture of a wide variety of data measures from large numbers of individuals. Furthermore, the development and refinement of statistical machine learning methods has revolutionized the approach to analysis of such high-dimensional datasets. This background provides a unique opportunity to leverage and analyze “big data” in order to develop clinical risk prediction algorithms and personalized medicine tools in MS.  Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions (MS PATHS) is a network of 10 MS centers that have standardized elements of their clinical practice to implement a centralized health information exchange architecture. MS PATHS was designed around the concept of a learning health system (LHS), merging research with ongoing patient care by collecting standardized clinical and imaging data during routine medical visits. As of August, 2019, >15,000 patients have opted to participate in MS PATHS. Thus, the MS PATHS network is an ideal, deeply phenotyped, “real-world”, large population of people with MS, in which clinically relevant predictive algorithms may be developed and validated.  The goal of the current project is to develop and validate multi-modal predictive algorithms of clinically relevant disease outcomes in MS. We hypothesize that integrating a wide variety of potential predictors, including demographics, clinical characteristics (including current/historical DMT use), comorbidities/lifestyle factors, MRI- derived measures and laboratory data (including serum NfL) will lead to the development and validation of algorithms that may accurately predict future clinical disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity. Furthermore, this approach will allow the assessment of the individual contribution of specific predictors to the developed predictive algorithms, and may aid with the identification of novel risk factors of disease severity in MS. Project Narrative Successful completion of this project will lead to the development and dissemination of clinically relevant predictive algorithms to enable personalized risk assessment and therapeutic decision-making in MS, provide the means to optimize selection/stratification of participants in clinical trials, and will also provide insight regarding the interactions and relative importance of putative prognostic factors in MS.",Prediction of risk of disability worsening and inflammatory disease activity in MS utilizing multimodal prediction algorithms,10039145,K23NS117883,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Award', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Elements', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'design', 'dexterity', 'disability', 'follow-up', 'foot', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'lifestyle factors', 'machine learning method', 'multimodality', 'neurofilament', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'performance tests', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'processing speed', 'prognostic', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'walking speed']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,199260,0.05738828648249777
"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome.

"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements.

"Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Novel Platform for Quantitative Subcellular Resolution Imaging of Human Tissues Using Mass Spectrometry Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful technique that enables label-free spatial mapping of different classes of biomolecules in biological systems. Because it does not require any special sample pretreatment, ambient MSI is particularly attractive for high throughput automated imaging applications. The throughput of ambient MSI experiments is typically limited by the inherently slow microprobe-type sampling from surfaces, which is a characteristic shortcoming of many chemical imaging modalities. This project will combine several highly innovative approaches to address challenges associated with the high-throughput high- resolution ambient MSI of lipids and metabolites using nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI). Nano-DESI is an ambient ionization technique, which relies on gentle localized liquid extraction of molecules from tissue sections into a flowing solvent confined between two glass capillaries. The extracted molecules are efficiently delivered to a mass spectrometer inlet and ionized by soft electrospray ionization. Nano-DESI MSI enables detection of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and peptides in tissue sections with high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, and without special sample pretreatment. Furthermore, on-the-fly quantification of lipids and metabolites in tissue sections during nano-DESI imaging experiments is achieved by doping the working solvent with appropriate standards of known concentration. This project will extend these powerful capabilities of nano-DESI MSI to enable high-throughput imaging of large tissue sections of interest to the HubMAP Consortium. This will be achieved using a combination of a conceptually different nano-DESI probe design optimized for robustness, ease of fabrication, and spatial resolution and a suite of advanced machine learning and compressed sensing computational approaches. These developments will be applicable to different types of human tissues and will transform quantitative molecular imaging of multiple classes of biomolecules in tissue sections. Although the capabilities of the new imaging platform will be demonstrated using non-diseased tissue, these developments will be broadly applicable to scientific problems associated with understanding health and disease Project Narrative This research is focused on the development of a transformative technology for rapid, quantitative, and robust imaging of different classes of biomolecules in human tissues using mass spectrometry.

"Uncovering the Human Secretome PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peptide hormones regulate embryonic development and most physiological processes by acting as endocrine or paracrine signals. They are also a rich source of relatively safe medicines to treat both common and rare diseases. Yet finding peptide-coding genes below ~300 base pairs is inherently difficult because they lie within the noise of the genome. Recent multidisciplinary, proteophylogenomic studies in lower species, such as yeast and flies, have uncovered hundreds of new small protein-coding genes called “smORFs”. In humans, recent work on the mitochondrial genome has also uncovered dozens of small peptide hormone genes called MDPs. Based on these and other studies, it is estimated that about 5% of proteins in the human nuclear genome have not yet been discovered, particularly those that encode small peptides below 100 amino acids. It is a well documented but rarely challenged practice to discard large quantities of sequencing and proteomic data because they do not match the annotated human genome. My overarching goal is to discover the human “secretome” and make practical use of it to improve the human condition. Over the past few years, we have developed a unique pipeline of technologies that combines breakthroughs in math, computer hardware and software, proteomics, mass spectrometry, and HTS screening, each of which has been optimized and integrated. Our GeneFinder software modules, based on machine-learning, can process data 100 times faster than traditional methods and rapidly validate small human genes using public and in-house generated databases of genetic and proteomic data. Using the prototype version of the platform that finds conservation between humans, chimp, and macaque, we have discovered thousands of putative peptide-coding genes and validated hundreds of them. We aim to (1) further improve the algorithm to increase its speed and accuracy, (2) improve the genome annotation for thousands of small novel genes, (3) determine their expression profiles in normal and diseased tissues, (4) explore their genetic association with disease loci, and (5) screen the first secretomic library to find hormones with novel biological and therapeutically relevant activities. The data, the software package, and libraries will be made available to the research community. In doing so, we will shed light on the dark matter of the human genome, the parts with the greatest therapeutic potential, thereby helping to steer and accelerate the pace of research and drug development for generations to come. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a rapid expansion in the use of peptide hormones as drugs over the last decade, yet new research indicates that more than 90% of all hormones in the body (encoded by an additional 5% of the human genome) remain to be discovered. As a result, terabytes of data are discarded each week and innumerable opportunities for biological discovery are missed because, according to our findings, the majority of genes below ~300 base pairs are missing from the annotated human genome. We propose an integrated, multi- disciplinary approach to find, validate and characterize an estimated 4000-5000 new peptide-coding genes using a pioneering technology platform that combines breakthroughs in math, custom-built computer hardware and software, and wet-lab approaches, providing a far more complete roadmap for biology and medicine in the 21st century.",Uncovering the Human Secretome,9928344,DP1AG058605,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Base Pairing', 'Biological', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Hardware', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Embryonic Development', 'Endocrine', 'Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Nuclear', 'Pan Genus', 'Paracrine Communication', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'dark matter', 'drug development', 'fly', 'genetic association', 'genome annotation', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'mitochondrial genome', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peptide hormone', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'screening', 'terabyte']",NIA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,DP1,2020,1186500,0.06097649288764966
"Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) instrumentation have not been fully leveraged to upgrade the information content of metabolomics datasets obtained from stable isotope labeling studies. This is primarily due to lack of validated software tools for extracting and interpreting isotope enrichments from HRMS datasets. The overall objective of the current application is to develop tools that enable the metabolomics community to fully leverage stable isotopes to profile metabolic network dynamics. Two new tools will be implemented within the open-source OpenMS software library, which provides an infrastructure for rapid development and dissemination of mass spectrometry software. The first tool will automate tasks required for extracting isotope enrichment information from HRMS datasets, and the second tool will use this information to group ion peaks into interaction networks based on similar patterns of isotope labeling. The tools will be validated using in-house datasets derived from metabolic flux studies of animal and plant systems, as well as through feedback from the metabolomics community. The rationale for the research is that the software tools will enable metabolomics investigators to address important questions about pathway dynamics and regulation that cannot be answered without the use of stable isotopes. The first aim is to develop a software tool to automate data extraction and quantification of isotopologue distributions from HRMS datasets. The software will provide several key features not included in currently available metabolomics software: i) a graphical, interactive user interface that is appropriate for non-expert users, ii) support for native instrument file formats, iii) support for samples that are labeled with multiple stable isotopes, iv) support for tandem mass spectra, and v) support for multi-group or time-series comparisons. The second aim is to develop a companion software that applies machine learning and correlation-based algorithms to group unknown metabolites into modules and pathways based on similarities in isotope labeling. The third aim is to validate the tools through comparative analysis of stable isotope labeling in test standards and samples from animal and plant tissues, including time-series and dual-tracer experiments. A variety of collaborators and professional working groups will be engaged to test and validate the software, and the tools will be refined based on their feedback. The proposed research is exceptionally innovative because it will provide the advanced software capabilities required for both targeted and untargeted analysis of isotopically labeled metabolites, but in a flexible and user-friendly environment. The research is significant because it will contribute software tools that automate and standardize the data processing steps required to extract and utilize isotope enrichment information from large-scale metabolomics datasets. This work will have an important positive impact on the ability of metabolomics investigators to leverage information from stable isotopes to identify unknown metabolic interactions and quantify flux within metabolic networks. In addition, it will enable entirely new approaches to study metabolic dynamics within biological systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will develop novel software tools to quantify and interpret data from stable isotope labeling experiments, which can be used to uncover relationships between metabolites and biochemical pathways. These tools have potential to accelerate progress toward identifying the causes and cures of many important diseases that impact metabolism.",Tools for Leveraging High-Resolution MS Detection of Stable Isotope Enrichments to Upgrade the Information Content of Metabolomics Datasets,10002192,U01CA235508,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Infrastructure', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Plants', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'comparative', 'computerized data processing', 'data standards', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'file format', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'stable isotope', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'working group']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,427122,0.0975187376779859
"Imaging Mass Spectrometry for metabolome mapping SUMMARY In response to NOT-GM-20-013, we are requesting a supplement to our R01 5R01GM120033-04 for an MALDI imaging source unit to be attached to an existing Q ExactiveMass Spectrometer (Ultra-High Mass Range Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™) for spatial mapping of metabolites in thin tissue sections. Within our R01 award, to analyze NMR metabolome data we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on recent developments in machine learning. We have coded these algorithms and tested their sensitivity and specificity on both synthesized and real data. We then applied these methods to human disease models and identified putative biomarkers. To validate these biomarkers, we have developed methods to analyze animal tissues and human brain organoids using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS), which permits spatial localization of metabolites without labeling. This targeted IMS metabolic phenotyping approach complements our untargeted NMR methods: it allows us to determine whether the individual metabolites identified by NMR represent bona fide biomarkers and to develop metabolic hypotheses for their association with disease. We submit this request for imaging mass spectrometer hardware because a nearby IMS facility on which we have relied has closed and no other IMS facility exists in greater Houston area. Performing the IMS studies ourselves, with the help of collaborators, will accelerate our discovery about the role small molecules and metabolites play in health and disease. This instrument will help us better i) perform metabolome screens to identify the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on neural cell types in human brain organoid models; ii) perform high-throughput drug screening to stimulate neural stem cells to produce new neurons in the brain organoid models to regenerate damaged tissue; and iii) use our NMR algorithms to develop a protocol for quantitative imaging. None of these studies will be possible without the imaging mass spectrometer. Given our access to state-of-the-art equipment, data-collection expertise, and new analytical algorithms that are especially sensitive and specific to NMR spectral data, we are uniquely positioned to advance biomarker and diagnostics tools and screening methods for metabolites and synthetic small molecules. Using an imaging mass spectrometer to map metabolite distribution may help us discover diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers not only for SARS-CoV-2, but for a broad spectrum of brain disorders that lead to neurodegeneration. Such broad usage of our platform would be transformative for neuroscientists, neurologists, and their patients. NARRATIVE The metabolome is a dynamic and sensitive biological system that reflects both innate processes and environmental influences, and can therefore tell us much about an organism's health and homeostasis. In our R01, we are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms to analyze NMR metabolome data.

"High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Glycosylation fulfills important physiological functions, including protein folding, embryogenesis, cell adhesion, pathogen recognition, and immune response. The multifaceted roles glycosylation plays derive from the presence of a range of glycan epitopes, where a small structural variation can have a profound impact on functions. Further, a glycome consists of many closely related structures, with their relative amounts determined by metabolic conditions in a cell- and growth-specific manner. Altered glycosylation is linked to many diseases, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Thus, there is a clear need for analytical methods that can rapidly identify and quantify the many glycoforms in a glycome from different health and disease states. Finally, no genome-predicted glycan database exists due to the unscripted nature of glycan biosynthesis, and discovery of new glycan structures must be achieved by de novo methods. Although tandem mass spectrometry-based biopolymer sequencing has been the major catalyst to the recent rapid advance of 'omics, the prevailing collisionally activated dissociation method often fails to provide sufficient glycan structural detail at the MS2 level, whereas the MSn approach lacks the speed, sensitivity, and quantitative potential for high-throughput glycome analysis. We have recently developed an electronic excitation dissociation (EED) method that can yield rich structural information in a single stage of MS/MS analysis. However, the impact of EED on glycomics research is currently limited by its poor accessibility, insufficient coupling to on-line glycan separation methods, and difficulty in interpretation of complex glycan EED tandem mass spectra. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach that combines EED with on-line liquid chromatography (LC) separation and a novel bioinformatics tool to achieve high-throughput, de novo, and comprehensive glycome characterization. We will explore the potential of EED for analysis of glycans in various derivatized forms, study their fragmentation behaviors, and establish fragmentation rules for the development of bioinformatics software. We will optimize conditions for efficient coupling of EED to reversed-phase, and porous graphitic carbon LC, and develop an LC-EED-MS/MS approach for simultaneous characterization and quantitation of glycan mixtures. We will implement EED on a Q-TOF instrument to improve its access to the glycoscience community. Finally, we will develop and rigorously test the performance of a novel bioinformatics software that can rapidly and accurately determine each glycan's structure from its tandem MS spectra. The proposed algorithm is fundamentally different from most existing software, in that it no longer relies solely on glycosidic and cross-ring fragments for topology and linkage analysis, but rather adopts a machine learning approach that considers the contexts of various types of fragment peaks, and the spectral features associated with different linkage configurations and structural motifs. The availability of such a high-throughput, de novo glycan sequencing tool will have an immense impact on many biomedical research fields, as glycosylation plays critical roles in almost all biological pathways.

The proposed algorithm is fundamentally different from most existing software, in that it no longer relies solely on glycosidic and cross-ring fragments for topology and linkage analysis, but rather adopts a machine learning approach that considers the contexts of various types of fragment peaks, and the spectral features associated with different linkage configurations and structural motifs. The availability of such a high-throughput, de novo glycan sequencing tool will have an immense impact on many biomedical research fields, as glycosylation plays critical roles in almost all biological pathways. Awarded Project Narrative Characterization of glycans from biological sources requires sensitive and high-throughput analytical methods that can separate and identify each glycoform in a complex mixture.

"Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that destroys the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells, and its cause is unknown. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, leading to the hypothesis that sun exposure, and consequently vitamin D exposure, has a protective effect on MS risk. Recent studies utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis have demonstrated strong evidence for a causal role of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in MS pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association are unknown. It is well established that 25(OH)D signaling operates through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. VDRs recognize specific binding sites in DNA, leading to activation or suppression of a target gene. Previous research has found that genetic variation of tagging SNPs (VDR-BVs) within these VDR binding sites, can alter binding affinity. These VDR-BVs are enriched in genomic regions associated with MS, as well as with several other autoimmune diseases, which suggests regulation of specific genes mediated by vitamin D could affect MS risk and severity. No formal investigation of genetic variation of individual VDR-BVs in MS cases and controls has been reported and VDR-BVs are strong candidates to investigate for genetic variation relevant to MS. The overall objective of this F31 application is to estimate the effect of VDR-BVs on MS risk and severity. We hypothesize that genetic variation in VDR-BVs is associated with MS susceptibility and severity, and further, that the effect of this genetic variation on MS is modulated by bioavailability of vitamin D. Our approach will use a dataset of approximately 10,000 clinically definite MS cases and 35,000 controls frequency matched on age and race/ethnicity with whole genome genotypes, demographic, clinical, and environmental exposure data and will: 1) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs near established MS risk loci and MS risk and severity; 2) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs across the human genome and MS risk and severity; and 3) Replicate findings in independent datasets of MS cases and controls and combine replicated associations across all datasets via meta-analysis. VDR-BVs were previously identified through ChIP-seq analysis in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines and we will use machine learning to prioritize candidate VDR-BVs for Aim 2. Analyses will incorporate a genetic instrumental variable as measure of 25(OH)D bioavailability to test for interaction between VDR-BVs and 25(OH)D bioavailability. Results from the proposed aims will determine whether MS GWAS findings are partially explained by genetic variation in VDR binding affinity, identify genetic risk factors for MS related to vitamin D, and identify new genes and regulatory pathways involved in the development of MS. Ultimately, the goal of this work understand the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects this immune- mediated neurological disorder. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that results in significant disability and decreased quality of life with both genetic and environmental risk factors. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, and recent research has demonstrated evidence supporting a causal role for low vitamin D in MS risk and disease severity. The objective of this F31 fellowship application is to identify and characterize vitamin D binding sites that are associated with susceptibility to MS and disease severity.",Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity,9992281,F31NS113537,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'California', 'ChIP-seq', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Study Subject', 'Sun Exposure', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vitamin D3 Receptor', 'Work', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'multiple datasets', 'nervous system disorder', 'pediatric multiple sclerosis', 'programs', 'protective effect', 'receptor binding', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2020,40987,0.04732348367918227

"Multimodal mass spectrometry imaging of mouse and human liver We propose to develop a multimodal mass spectrometry imaging pipeline with novel desorption sources and data integration that will enable simultaneously mapping of biomolecule abundance in 3-dimensions in biological tissues at high spatial resolution (micron to submicron) and high speed (>10 ms/pixel) in a near-native environment. This would provide previously inaccessible information on cellular and tissue organization, and how homeostasis and disease intersect at the level of tissue physiology. A major challenge for performing multi- omics using mass spectrometry imaging has been the (i) lack of universal ionization methods, (ii) limited sample preparation protocols for preserving chemical gradients, (iii) low sensitivity, and (iv) limited tools for integration of large quantities of data. Our laboratories are developing systematic MS imaging for high sensitivity and high resolution analysis of diverse tissues. We discovered that water-based gas cluster ion beams (H2O-GCIB) operating at high energy yield ionization enhancements of multiple biomolecules (e.g., metabolites, lipids, and peptides/protein fragments) with high sensitivity at 1 µm lateral resolution and without labeling or complicated sample preparation. Coupled with unique Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) instrumentation and cryogenic sample handling, we have imaged biomolecules directly in cells and tissues in a near-native state (i.e., frozen-hydration) with feature resolution of 1-10 µm. Low concentration biomolecules (e.g. cardiolipin and metabolites) that were impossible to localize in single cells previously are now visible with 3-dimensional localization. Moreover, the sufficient signal per pixel, we can use automated data analysis to characterize biologically active functional sites within 1 µm2 and areas of interest in single cells. We further developed data integration methods to combine imaging data from adjacent sections to create a multi-model imaging data sets. We propose to develop a pipeline for MS imaging analysis of biomolecules, and to elucidate molecular heterogeneity in tissues using multimodal imaging. To support the multi-modal analysis pipeline, we will develop an integrated data analysis platform. Integration of multiomics remains challenging, particularly spatially localize multiple biomolecules at single cell level. The direct visualization of cellular contents provides information on biomolecular composition, interactions and functions. This network of biomolecules is the driving force of specific behavior of cells in physiological states. Despite this, a comprehensive grasp of these interactions at cellular level has not moved beyond segregated methods. Our efforts will result in an integrated multimodal imaging platform to summon the best characteristics of each image form, acquiring a complete picture the biomolecular network at spatial resolution of 1 µm. With this direct visualization, we will address how metabolism links with functional biomarkers that stem from metabolism-associated protein complexes and phase-separated membrane-less organelles at the subcellular level, and how this drive different cell death modalities, including different modes of cell death.

"A Proteogenomic Search Engine for Direct Mass Spectrometric Identification of Variant Proteins Using Genomic Data Project Summary / Abstract Mass spectrometry-based proteomics, used in conjunction with genomics, has been called proteogenomics. Recent exponential increases in variant identification by next-generation sequencing (NGS) is redefining the concept of the human genome/proteome. Our project is the commercialization of a first-to-market proteomic database search engine for mass spectrometry capable of directly reading NGS data for the identification of mutilations from individual samples or from curated resources. Such an offering has the potential to bring together these two fields, enabling validation of mutations at the protein-level. Mutated proteins have been shown to make ideal targets for drug therapies and diagnostics in cancer. Our software will provide an intuitive user experience, approachable by scientists who may not be expert both proteomic and genomic data analysis. Since the search engine is guided by prior knowledge, performance exceeds current practice. The software will come complete with a full array of post-processing validation, and visualization tools. Project Narrative The detection of protein variants, which differ from those predicted from the reference human genome sequence, can make ideal candidates for the development of targeted treatments and diagnostics for many clinical conditions such as cancer.

"Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin. Early detection of CTCL is associated with positive clinical outcomes, but diagnosis is often complicated by the heterogeneous clinical and histological presentation. Additionally, systemic therapies remain sub- optimal for CTCL, highlighting the need for new treatment strategies. To date, most studies have been performed on blood from CTCL patients, which has revealed a complex interplay between host immunity, malignant T-cells and the tumor microenvironment. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern disease pathogenesis, especially in the skin, remain largely undefined.  The goal of the proposed research is to use new technologies that allow for multi-parametric, high- resolution analyses in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) skin tissue samples to define the immune and metabolic profiles of CTCL at different stages of disease. The first technology is Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), which uses secondary ion mass spectrometry to visualize up to 100 metal conjugated antibodies simultaneously at nanometer resolution in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim I will use MIBI to define the heterogeneity and plasticity of cells that exist at the CTCL tumor-host interface, to improve the precision with which CTCL is diagnosed and treated. The second technology is matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI), which can detect thousands of metabolites in FFPE tissue sections. Specifically, Aim II will use MALDI-MSI to determine the reflective metabolic activity of the CTCL microenvironment, thereby adding functional insight to disease pathogenesis and revealing potential metabolically active therapeutic targets.  Overall, these studies will characterize the molecular heterogeneity and functional complexity of CTCL, which will shed light on how this disease evades immune destruction and reprograms energy- metabolism. As such, this work promises to improve the detection, treatment and clinical outcomes for CTCL. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare, but potentially devastating malignancy of the skin, whose pathogenesis remains poorly defined. By using multiparametric, high-resolution technologies to characterize the immune and metabolic profiles of the CTCL microenvironment, this work will add mechanistic insight to the underlying pathogenesis and improve the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for CTCL.",Characterizing the immune and metabolic profiles of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin tissue samples,9856137,F32CA233203,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Formalin', 'Glucose', 'Glycolysis', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sirolimus', 'Skin', 'Skin Tissue', 'Slide', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Secondary Ion', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Suppression', 'Work', 'antibody conjugate', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'effector T cell', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mTOR Inhibitor', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'molecular diagnostics', 'nanometer resolution', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'prognostic', 'protein expression', 'skin lesion', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,74758,-0.00584081836843679
"Skyline Targeted Proteomics Environment Development on Skyline started in 2008 to fill a critical need for a software tool that enabled targeted proteomics experiments. Since then, Skyline has grown into an entire ecosystem of tools, expanding well beyond targeted proteomics. The Skyline software ecosystem is one of the most widely used software platforms in all of mass spectrometry, supporting thousands of investigators in their research. The synergy between Skyline software development and its vast and thriving user community uniquely generate exciting new opportunities for quantitative mass spectrometry. Skyline has been a key factor in the success and growth of this new field, with Skyline itself becoming one of the most significant software tools in mass spectrometry. Since 2015, we have expanded Skyline software, from just the traditional targeted proteomics experiments that used selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with triple quadrupole (QQQ) mass spectrometers, to broadly encompass ALL types of quantitative proteomics experiments, including data dependent acquisition (DDA) experiments using MS1 peak areas (aka MS1 filtering), targeted tandem mass spectrometry (aka parallel reaction monitoring or PRM) experiments and data independent acquisition (DIA). As of Oct 2019, Skyline has been installed >97,500 times (117% increase since 2015), has over 14,000 registered users (122% increase since 2015) on its website (http://skyline.ms) and is booted up >9,000 times per week (exceeding 17,500 bootups in a single week). The Skyline project has grown beyond the bounds of a single tool. Currently, there are 14 Skyline external tools (55% increase since 2015) that rely on a formalized framework in Skyline and available through its tool store, with more still in development. The prior grant cycle has greatly expanded a community of users and developers working with a common set of tools to analyze quantitative data from all six major mass spectrometry vendors. Specifically, our proposal has five aims. 1) Improve Skyline’s analysis of DDA data, 2) Improve Skyline’s analysis of DIA data, 3) Expand support of new molecule types within Skyline, 4) Support for new quantitative data types, and 5) Provide continued support and training for the Skyline ecosystem. Mass spectrometry has been a fundamental technology for the analysis diverse molecule types in health and disease. Targeted mass spectrometry measurements offer a promising alternative to immunological based assays that are the standard for quantitative protein measurements in clinical and basic research laboratories.

"Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine The overall goal of this project is to develop a safe, broadly effective, and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal infections. Antibodies against the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) of surface M (Emm) proteins of GAS are opsonic and are associated with protection against infection. Immunity has classically been described as “type-specific”, leading to the assumption that natural immunity confers protection against only one of the more than 200 different emm types of GAS. We now have new information that calls into question this classic view and serves as the basis for an entirely different approach to GAS vaccine design and development. A recent comprehensive sequence analysis of M proteins from a global collection of 175 emm types of GAS resulted in a new emm cluster typing system that classified 96.2% of all contemporary GAS isolates into 48 emm clusters containing structurally and functionally related M proteins. Moreover, 117 emm types contained in 16 clusters accounted for 94.4% of GAS infections in the world. Indeed, preclinical studies indicated that a multivalent vaccine containing N-terminal peptides from 30 prevalent M types cross-opsonized a significant number of non-vaccine emm types of GAS that co-localized in clusters with vaccine emm types. The frequency of cross-opsonic antibodies, combined with the emm cluster data, prompted us to conclude that there is a need for a paradigm shift away from the concept of “type-specific” immunity against GAS infections to one of “cluster-specific” immunity. Our overall hypothesis is that immunity to GAS infections is the result of both type-specific and cross-reactive antibodies against the N-terminal regions of M proteins and that a new approach employing computational predictions of peptide structures will result in a multivalent vaccine that will induce broadly protective immunity in populations throughout the world. Our preliminary results indicate the feasibility of using structure-based design to predict the antigenic relatedness of M peptides within a cluster. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1) Apply computational structure-based design in an iterative process with immunological data from Aim 2 to predict the minimal number of M peptide sequences that are most representative of the structural and physicochemical properties of the peptides in one emm cluster containing 17 GAS emm types, 2) determine the cross-reactive immunogenicity of the selected peptides with all seventeen emm types of GAS in the cluster, and apply the results to refine the computational design predictions in Aim 1, 3) apply the refined computational parameters from Aims 1 and 2 to analyze the remaining epidemiologically important emm clusters, select a comprehensive panel of peptides representing all emm types, construct four multivalent recombinant vaccine proteins, and assess potential cross-protective immunogenicity using in vitro bactericidal assays against all 117 emm types of GAS, and 4) determine the protective immunogenicity of the final multivalent vaccine in unique transgenic mice expressing human C4BP and factor H that will be immunized and then challenged with multiple emm types of GAS. The world needs an effective, safe and affordable vaccine to prevent group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. Although most GAS infections are mild, there are more than 18 million people with a chronic complication of a severe GAS disease worldwide, over 15 million of whom have rheumatic heart disease, another 2 million cases of severe disease occur each year and a total of 517,000 deaths annually are estimated to be due to this organism. Vaccine prevention of even a fraction of these life-threatening diseases could have a significant impact on the health of people around the world.",Structure-Based Design of a Broadly Protective Group A Streptococcal Vaccine,9965720,R01AI132117,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Bacteria', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Collection', 'Complement Factor H', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complication', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiology', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunity', 'Immunize', 'Immunologics', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'N-terminal', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organism', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Peptide Vaccines', 'Peptide antibodies', 'Peptides', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Vaccines', 'Recombinants', 'Rheumatic Heart Disease', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Streptococcal Infections', 'Streptococcal Vaccines', 'Streptococcus pyogenes', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vaccine Antigen', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'bactericide', 'base', 'cross reactivity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'hybrid protein', 'immunogenic', 'immunogenicity', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'peptide structure', 'preclinical study', 'prevent', 'protein aminoacid sequence', 'protein structure', 'retinal S antigen peptide M', 'synthetic peptide', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'vaccine evaluation']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE HEALTH SCI CTR,R01,2020,741796,0.03524695621175022
"Screening of Glycan Markers in Serum for Early Detection of HCC in Different Etiologies of Disease Abstract: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide and is rising in incidence in the US. 90% of patients in the US with liver cancer have underlying cirrhosis, thus guideline recommendations recommend surveillance in all patients with cirrhosis to facilitate early detection. Unfortunately, only 20-30% of patients are detected with early detection and are thus eligible for potentially curative treatments. There is an unmet need for reliable biomarkers for HCC to facilitate adherence to screening and for early detection. In the proposed work we will develop early detection strategies for HCC based on glycoproteomic profiles. Unique changes in glycosylation in proteins, which involve structural changes in glycan groups, have been shown to be important serum biomarkers for early cancer detection. Importantly, the subtle changes may only involve minor structures but they can be very specific in differentiating cirrhosis versus early versus late stage HCC. In addition, these changes may be specific to the etiology of liver disease. These glycan structural changes will be detected and monitored quantitatively using a mass spectrometry approach which has proven to be an accurate way to characterize even minor changes in structure which may be significant as biomarkers based on our previous mass analysis, tandem mass spectrometry measurements and databases which have been developed for glycan and glycopeptide analysis. This will be demonstrated for both glycan and glycopeptide screening from serum using novel extraction and separation methods coupled to mass spectrometry which can ultimately be used to distinguish early stage HCC from cirrhosis. The proposed work will deliver separations and mass spec methods enabling isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, permitting unequivocal assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We will be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. Novel software will be developed and used to assign these glycan structures. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV-related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC. This will be a multisite study to include all components required for a tumor biomarker lab including samples and sample preparation, separations and mass spec analysis, bioinformatics evaluation and statistical analysis. Ultimately, we will develop methods for discovery of glycan/glycopeptide markers from patient serum, the identification of potential markers and the development of new assays to provide a limited confirmation of these markers. Project Narrative: The proposed work will use new separations and mass spec methods to provide isomeric separation of glycans and glycopeptides, resulting in detailed assignment of protein glycosylation related to disease state. We expect to be able to distinguish different isomeric forms of fucosylation and sialylation which may contain important disease related markers. The markers will be discovered for specific etiologies of HCV- related, alcohol-related and NAFLD-related etiologies of HCC.

"Proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma Project Summary  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and therapeutic options are limited. There is a pressing need to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease in order to identify new effective biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC. Proteins are the functional molecules of the cell, and many clinically validated biomarkers and most drug targets are proteins; however, cancer omics studies have relied primarily on genomic platforms. By melding genomics with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the new field of proteogenomics provides an opportunity to more completely understand how somatic genomes activate aberrant protein networks that drive cancer pathogenesis. A major National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded initiative, the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the more recently established International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC), are promoting an integrated proteogenomics approach that is postulated to produce sounder therapeutic hypotheses and a new generation of protein biomarkers. The central purpose of this application is to forge a collaboration between a CPTAC team in the US and an ICPC team in China to enable proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discoveries in hepatitis B virus-related (HBV+) HCC, which attributes to 85% of HCC cases in China. The two teams bring complementary expertise required for a successful proteogenomic study of HCC. The China team has already generated the most comprehensive multi-omics dataset yet produced for liver cancer by applying proteogenomic profiling to a Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort (CHCC-HBV) with 159 cases, and the data has been preliminarily analyzed through collaborative efforts between the two teams. In this application, the US team will perform deep computational analyses of the proteogenomics data to generate prognostic models and therapeutic hypotheses, which will be experimentally validated in cell lines, animal models, and clinical specimens by the China team. Our specific Aims are: Aim 1) To develop and validate a protein-based prognostic model; Aim 2) To identify and validate subtype-specific causal drivers and therapeutic strategies; and Aim 3) To characterize the immune landscape of HBV+ HCC. Successful completion of this project will lead to new knowledge on HCC biology as well as new prognostic and treatment strategies for HBV+ HCC. Meanwhile, experimentally validated computational methods developed in this project will have wide application to the study of other cancers and other non-cancer diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV+ HCC) attributes to 85% of all HCC cases in China, and therapeutic options are limited. This project will forge a collaboration between a computational team in the US and an HCC oncology team in China to perform comprehensive molecular characterization of a large Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort using the new proteogenomic approach that systematically integrates genomics and mass spectrometry-based proteomics data.

"Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics PROJECT SUMMARY  Ovarian cancer (OC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related deaths for U.S. women and the deadliest gynecological disease. Lack of symptoms in addition to the deficiency of highly specific biomarkers for detection typically result in only 25% of OC cases being diagnosed at FIGO stage I. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most prevalent form of OC, but three rarer histological subtypes also exist— endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous. An effective screening strategy for early diagnosis would be particularly advantageous since 5-year OC survival rates can be as high as 90%. Unfortunately, protein biomarkers such as CA-125 do not have sufficient positive predictive value to be useful from a clinical perspective. We hypothesize that useful information regarding early stage HGSC and other ovarian cancers can be found in the serum metabolome. Our pilot studies in both humans and OC models, such as the double-knockout Dicer-Pten mouse recently developed by our team members, show great promise in this regard— average sensitivity and specificity for early detection have reached 97.8% and 99.0% in banked human serum samples, and up to100% in mice. These results have prompted us to perform a much deeper investigation of metabolome alterations associated with early stage ovarian cancers in larger serum sample sets, and over time. We will perform metabolomics experiments in mice and banked de-identified human serum samples with much higher coverage than before by “data fusing” various modes of ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), coupled with pathway-centric data analysis. We also propose supplementing serum-level metabolomics experiments with deep-coverage tissue mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) in both 2-D and 3-D, using a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), which have complementary ionization mechanisms. Furthermore, we propose to depart from the commonly used approach of tentatively identifying spectral features by only using accurate masses, and implement a “deep metabolite annotation” approach that uses both “fused” high-resolution techniques (high field Orbitrap MS, MS/MS, 2-D NMR) and a new technology based on collisional cross section predictions for both travelling wave and drift tube ion mobility-MS. High-grade serous ovarian cancer is the most common and deadliest type of ovarian cancer; it is diagnosed mostly at an advanced stage at which the cancer has already spread beyond the ovary or the fallopian tube, to the abdominal cavity. This advanced-stage diagnosis inevitably causes high mortality. In this project, we propose to study molecular changes associated with early disease both in mouse models that closely mimic human disease and in banked de-identified human serum samples, with the aim of ultimately designing a robust diagnostic panel.",Deep Ovarian Cancer Metabolomics,9985087,R01CA218664,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'CA-125 Antigen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cancer Patient', 'Carcinoma', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clear Cell', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrospray Ionization', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Female Genital Diseases', 'Genes', 'Genetically Engineered Mouse', 'Greater sac of peritoneum', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lesion', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mammalian Oviducts', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Molecular', 'Mucinous', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Ovarian', 'Ovary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Reproductive system', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Screening for Ovarian Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serous', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Travel', 'Tube', 'Woman', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer diagnosis', 'data fusion', 'design', 'diagnostic panel', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'hydrophilicity', 'ion mobility', 'ionization', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'member', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multimodality', 'mutant', 'new technology', 'premalignant', 'protein biomarkers', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'uncertain malignant potential neoplasm']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,410432,0.08267808821453655
