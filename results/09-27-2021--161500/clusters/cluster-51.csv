"SCH: INT: Computational Tools for Avoidaint/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder  Intellectual Merit: This project will for the first time provide the fundamental tools to integrate unique multimodal data toward screening, diagnosis, and intervention in eating disorders, with an initial focus on children with ARFID and related developmental and health disorders. This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID ·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9613247,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2019,165108,0.13891493876609728
"A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Early Childhood Obesity Among WIC Participating Families PROJECT SUMMARY Early childhood obesity continues to be a clinical and public health challenge in the United States; almost a third of children ages 2-to-5 years old are either overweight or obese. Children who are overweight during early childhood are at least 5 times more likely than normal weight children to be overweight/obese as adults. Non- Hispanic blacks (NHB) have double and Hispanics have triple the rates of obesity compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW) and Asians (10.4%,15.6%, 5.2%, and 5.0%, respectively). Once established, obesity and its comorbid medical conditions are difficult to treat and usually persist throughout adulthood. Thus, preventing its development as early as possible in life is critical to reduce the health care costs associated with obesity- related chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Current evidence suggests that pregnancy, infancy and early childhood may be critical time periods in the development of overweight/obesity throughout the lifespan but many knowledge gaps remain. These gaps include understanding factors that contribute to high risk for excessive weight gain during gestation, infancy and early childhood which may also partially explain differential response to intervention strategies. Moreover, risk for the development of overweight and obesity during these critical developmental periods appear to be increased in children from racial and ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status backgrounds, but there is a paucity of studies in the literature that include these groups. To better understand how early life factors impact the onset of childhood obesity by age 5, this study will utilize data from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program in Miami Dade County (MDC), Florida. Specifically, we will examine the relationship between pregnancy (maternal weight, gestational diabetes, smoking, alcohol/substance use) and early life (initiation, exclusive and duration of breastfeeding, time of introduction to solid food) risk/ protective factors and child body mass index percentile and z score at age 5. Covariates include mother's race/ethnicity, education level and household income. Statistical models will be evaluated using machine learning-cross validation techniques. This approach has not been previously applied to the obesity science to examine pregnancy and early life obesity risk/protective factors. The analyses take advantage of a robust secondary data set that is arguably one of the most diverse in the country; the WIC program currently services almost half of the nation's mothers babies and young children (as does the local program for MDC) who are from predominantly low income and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The findings from this study will inform the development of obesity prevention interventions targeting pregnancy, prenatal and early childhood developmental periods. Project Narrative The proposed research will increase the understanding of pregnancy and early life obesity risk factors and how these factors vary by ethnic group in low income families, addressing a critical gap in the literature. This study will utilize machine learning-cross validation techniques to ensure the external reliability and validity of our statistical models. Study results generated here will inform the development and delivery of pregnancy and early life obesity prevention interventions and actionable recommendations for pediatric and family clinical care delivered to diverse families.",A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Early Childhood Obesity Among WIC Participating Families,9870787,F31DK116533,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent obesity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Asians', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational Background', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Family', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Florida', 'Food', 'Food Supplements', 'Genetic', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Household', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Nursery Schools', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'adult obesity', 'clinical care', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early onset', 'ethnic disparity', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'federal poverty level', 'feeding', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lower income families', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal weight', 'minority children', 'mortality', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'systematic review']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2019,38616,0.11224422209813747
"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,9796542,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Comorbidity', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,488645,0.10569008915099647
"Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Unhealthy eating increases the risk of developing several kinds of cancer. This occurs directly through consumption of carcinogenic food, and indirectly through overweight and obesity. Because nearly 70% of American adults are overweight or obese, it is critical to develop effective interventions to alter eating behavior. One key factor that influences eating behavior and weight gain is cue-induced food craving. Craving stimulates appetitive motivation to eat, but can be regulated via cognitive strategies such as reappraisal, or the reconstrual of a stimulus to change its affective meaning. Reappraisal increases the salience of consumption- related costs and reduces food craving for unhealthy food. Craving reappraisal is therefore a promising target for interventions designed to reduce unhealthy eating and risk for diet-related cancers. However, individual differences in treatment efficacy remain a persistent problem with interventions. To understand why an intervention works for some individuals and not for others requires clearly defined neurobiological mechanisms of change, as well as sensitive and specific tools to evaluate individual differences in psychological targets. To fill this gap, the goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and multivariate neuroimaging methods to develop and validate a sensitive and specific neural signature of craving reappraisal that can be used as a neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability. To achieve this goal, this project will pursue the following Aims: 1) develop and validate a neural signature of craving reappraisal in an independent sample of existing data, and 2) establish the predictive and incremental validity the neural signature in the context of an ongoing randomized control trial of cognitive reappraisal training to reduce unhealthy eating in overweight and obese adults. Specifically, after development, I will test the construct validity of the neural signature by assessing whether expression of the signature is greater while participants reappraise their desire for craved food than while they simply view these foods (Aim 1). I will also test the predictive and incremental validity of the neural signature by assessing the extent to which individual differences the neural signature change predict intervention outcomes, such as the value of unhealthy food and eating behavior, above and beyond standard methods (Aim 2). Upon completion of this project, I will have developed and validated a sensitive and specific neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be readily used by other researchers to evaluate intervention efficacy and individual differences in responsivity to treatment. I will also receive in-depth training in translational neuroscience interventions for cancer control, and multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning. This work will facilitate the refinement of reappraisal-based interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity and risk for diet-related cancers. Further, by documenting my analysis process and sharing my analysis code, the results of this work can readily be adopted by others to study a variety of psychological processes relevant to eating behavior and cancer risk. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive reappraisal can be used to reduce food craving and unhealthy eating (a key risk factor for several kinds of cancer), but interventions to train reappraisal ability are not equally effective for all individuals. This project aims to leverage multivariate neuroimaging and machine learning techniques to develop an objective, neurobiological index of craving reappraisal ability that can be used to assess individual differences in treatment responsivity. The knowledge and research training gained from this project will prepare the trainee to build and refine interventions to reduce unhealthy eating that will ultimately reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and risk for diet-related cancers.",Cancer Prevention through Dietary Change: Training in translational neuroimaging,9756118,F31CA232357,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Intervention', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Goals', 'Health Promotion', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'adult obesity', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'carcinogenicity', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'control trial', 'cost', 'craving', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'food craving', 'increased appetite', 'indexing', 'intervention effect', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'open source', 'parent grant', 'post intervention', 'predictive test', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,F31,2019,39535,0.12811995028874168
"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients. Commonly used dietary patterns are a priori diet score/index based on a set of dietary recommendations for a healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Healthy Eating Index) or data-driven dietary patterns (e.g., prudent diet, western diet). Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional. The proposed study provides an excellent opportunity to develop new dietary patterns that capture eating behaviors such as when we eat and how often we eat during a day. The findings of the study about healthy eating patterns will also improve dietary recommendations by adding messages on when and how often to eat during a day.",TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS,9659103,R01CA226937,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anthropometry', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calories', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Evaluation', 'Fasting', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'dietary guidelines', 'doubly-labeled water', 'epidemiology study', 'food consumption', 'good diet', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'prudent diet', 'tool', 'vector', 'waist circumference', 'western diet']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,347716,0.08165582567489171
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9701190,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2019,139614,0.14238283636751636
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9751223,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2019,571889,0.17716837996132806
"Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity,9871505,K99HD100593,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Cholesterol', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'data reduction', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'energy balance', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'metabolic rate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'population based', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'sex', 'skills', 'vector', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K99,2019,108276,0.06638739507774402
"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI.

"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9771304,F32HL143954,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Energy Intake', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Wing', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'dietary adherence', 'digital', 'experience', 'falls', 'food consumption', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity treatment', 'prevent', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'sleep pattern', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment program', 'weight loss program', 'weight maintenance', 'willingness']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2019,60552,0.07563213919813783
"VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials PROJECT SUMMARY  Chronic diseases and conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems in the United States. A healthy dietary pattern is paramount in disease risk reduction. Since 2010, the dietary pattern approach has been recommended to examine the relation of the totality of diet and health outcomes by U.S. Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committees; meanwhile longitudinal dietary data have become increasingly available. Yet, methods are underdeveloped for characterizing longitudinal diet-quality variations and even rudimentary for validating diet- quality patterns that describe these dynamic variations, therefore, leading to unclear evidence for assessing diet-health/disease relationships and formulating dietary guidelines. A noticeable gap exists between dietary pattern literature and the fast-growing statistical learning field. We propose to develop an innovative statistical learning tool for diet-quality trajectory pattern-recognition based on rich and highly-comparable longitudinal dietary datasets from randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies (OS) pertaining to a variety of individuals, race/ethnicities, and geographical locations, and spanning up to 30 years, collected across 4 NIH- funded RCTs in Massachusetts, and 2 large-scale multi-site national RCT and OS studies as well as simulated dietary data based on these trials. Our project builds on PI Fang’s NIH-funded behavioral trajectory pattern-recognition tool (Multiple-Imputation based Fuzzy Clustering, MIFuzzy) which processes longitudinal trial data with missing and zero-inflated values, and identifies latent trajectory patterns that characterize patients’ complex engagement and cognitive response variations during multi-component RCTs and better explains the heterogeneity of treatment effects. This project will enhance and expand MIFuzzy to a Visual- Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition tool (VIP), adapted to diet-quality trajectory pattern analyses and chronic disease risk assessment. Our goal is to provide a new multi-view of diet-quality trajectory patterns and associated outcomes from longitudinal studies. Based upon high-quality and comparable RCT and OS longitudinal dietary data from NIDDK-, NHLBI-, and NIMH-funded studies, this VIP project will help grow more valid evidence for developing dietary guidelines and clarify our understanding of diet-disease relationships for a range of patient/individual types, potentially enabling better personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Developing this evidence-based VIP tool will also contribute to the infrastructure for diet-related studies, advance pattern- recognition methods, help scientific communities and the lay public compare with local and national diet-quality guidelines, and assess dietary health risks. In the long run, this VIP project will contribute to creating a data management platform that support near-real-time pattern analyses and adaptive interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Evaluating diet quality and encouraging healthful dietary change is paramount for preventing, or managing, many chronic conditions and diseases, including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Our innovative Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern-recognition (VIP) method will identify clusters of distinct diet-quality patterns in multiple longitudinal dietary datasets from local and national NIH-funded randomized controlled trials and observational studies. This work will help formulate stronger evidence for national dietary guidelines, deepen our understanding of diet quality trajectory patterns, and elucidate relationships between these patterns and chronic diseases for a range of patient/individual types; it can potentially enable personalized, adaptive dietary strategies. Open-access dissemination of our diet quality pattern recognition tool will contribute to the infrastructure of dietary-intervention studies, advance pattern recognition methodology, and help the scientific community and the public to compare individual dietary behaviors with local and national diet-quality patterns and associated health risks.",VIP:Visual-Valid Dietary Behavior Pattern Recognition for Local-National Trials,9907572,R56DK114514,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Eating', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention Studies', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal observational study', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Factors', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Reduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Visual Pattern Recognition', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data management', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'dietary guidelines', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'field study', 'good diet', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal dataset', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'simulation', 'social media', 'sociodemographics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH,R56,2019,452178,0.06987140125966439
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth.

"2020 Nanoscale Science and Engineering for Agriculture and Food Systems Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary The objectives of this GRC are: 1) To bring together experts and stakeholders to discuss nanotechnology advances, directions, and needs in food and agriculture; 2) To identify cutting-edge research and emerging opportunities to address global challenges of food security, environmental sustainability, food safety, and agricultural productivity. A major goal of this GRC is to promote exceptional early career and female investigators, as well as those of traditionally underrepresented populations, to ensure the continued growth in diversity of scholars in our vibrant community. A diverse range of invited speakers and discussion leaders will present a comprehensive vision of critical and emerging nanotechnology research advances across the field of agricultural science. The program illustrates a targeted excellent diversity of leadership (6), speakers (23), and discussion leaders (11) across the spectrum of: i) gender diversity (19 females, 21 males); ii) USA (24) /International participation (16), representing Austria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, India, Italy, Korea, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, and Taiwan; and iii) industry and government (3), which includes the FDA, FAO, a founder of a blockchain startup company, and senior research scientist at a non-governmental organization. The following topics will be included in the program: Food and nutrition, bioinspired and targeted technologies, sensing and tracking, microbiomes, food contact materials and human health and disease. Discussions on the safe deployment of nanotechnology in these areas, public perception and policy, and influence on industry and entrepreneurship are integral to this GRC. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the FDA center responsible for protecting the health of US consumers, will find the following sessions of great interest, Convergence of Nanotechnology with Food & Agriculture; Advances in Nanomaterials; Environmental Nanotechnology; Nano-enabled Approaches to Improving Human & Animal Health; Translation of Nano-Based Science for Application in Food & Agriculture; Big Data, Machine Learning, AI & Modeling; and Nanotechnology's Impact on Food Safety. The significant contributions of this diverse population will provide the strong intellectual infrastructure required to develop safe and sustainable nano-enabled applications in food and agriculture in direct support of the FDA CFSAN goal of ensuring the safety, security, sanitation, and proper labeling of the U.S. food supply. Project Narrative Nanomaterials and nanotechnology are rapidly entering almost every industry around the world. The co-chairs of this GRC envision that the convergence between nanotechnology, biotechnology and information science within plant science, animal science, crop and food science/technology and environmental science will lead to revolutionary advances in improving public health. The successful achievement of this lofty vision requires the profound intellectual commitment of scientists and engineers in a highly integrated engagement across numerous disciplines. Some success examples with a focus on nanotechnology in food include: nano- biosensors for identification of pathogens, toxins and bacteria in foods; identification systems for tracking animal and plant materials from origination to consumption; development of nanotechnology-based foods with lower calories and with less fat, salt and sugar, while retaining flavor and texture; integrated systems for sensing, monitoring and active response intervention for plant and animal production; “smart field systems” to detect, locate, report and direct application of water; precision and controlled release of fertilizers and pesticides; development of plants that exhibit drought resistance and tolerance to salt and excess moisture; and nanoscale films for food packaging and contact materials that extend shelf life, retain quality, and reduce cooling requirements. Overall, nanoscale science and engineering has an important role in creating a safer and more productive agriculture and food system. Commercial advances and technological impacts have been limited somewhat due to the relative “newness” of nanotechnology in agriculture and food systems. Given that research at the nanoscale in agriculture and food systems is only into its second decade, safety of nano-enabled applications in agriculture are still up for debate. The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), the FDA center responsible for protecting the health of US consumers, will find the following sessions of great interest, Convergence of Nanotechnology with Food & Agriculture; Advances in Nanomaterials; Environmental Nanotechnology; Nano-enabled Approaches to Improving Human & Animal Health; Translation of Nano-Based Science for Application in Food & Agriculture; Big Data, Machine Learning, AI & Modeling; and Nanotechnology's Impact on Food Safety. In the spirit of the GRC mission, the 2020 Nano Ag & Food GRC and GRS will again bring together a diverse array of scientists and engineers, both senior and junior, postdocs, and graduate students from academia, as well as scientists and engineers from business, government, and Non-governmental organizations (NGOs); with an emphasis to attract researchers from around the world to engage in open scientific exchange.

"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9670105,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'professional atmosphere', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2019,202731,0.16429922301088185
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9453227,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2018,166481,0.13891493876609728
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9526588,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2018,141114,0.14238283636751636
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9513489,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2018,705027,0.17716837996132806

"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9609565,F32HL143954,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Energy Intake', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Wing', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'falls', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity treatment', 'prevent', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment program', 'weight loss program', 'weight maintenance', 'willingness']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2018,58282,0.07563213919813783
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9456759,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2018,202835,0.16429922301088185
"Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity is associated with high financial cost and increased morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Health care spending due to obesity is estimated to be as high as \$210 billion annually, or 21\% of total national spending. A childhood obesity surveillance system will discern disparities, detect aberrant signals, design targeted interventions, and track change over time. In addition to national public health surveillance systems, local data are increasingly necessary to reflect regional trends. Current systems in Wisconsin are subject to (1) bias estimation of obesity rates, (2) limited data in school-aged children ages 5-10 years, (3) insufficient power to estimate disparities in local subgroups, and (4) limited ability to track local changes over time. Therefore, the impact of investments and collective efforts in Wisconsin childhood obesity prevention has been difficult to measure. This, in turn, demands approaches that overcome and transcend the posited limitations. Since large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, there has been a paradigm shift and accelerated improvements in the use of EHR data for the purpose of population health promotion and tracking of progress. The University of Wisconsin Population Health Information Exchange (PHINEX) database contains de- identified EHR data from a multicenter healthcare system located primarily in south central Wisconsin. In partnership with The Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative, we aim to create an EHR model for a childhood obesity prevention surveillance system. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods using the platform of PHINEX for childhood obesity prevention purposes. This enhance and extend surveillance activities of childhood obesity conditions, and increase the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions aimed at changing policies, systems, and environments associated with childhood obesity. We plan to address the following aims: (1) robust estimation of the spatiotemporal prevalence at area level, (2) hot spot detection on areas with aberrant obesity incidence, and (3) prediction for childhood weight gain phenotypes. The developed and implemented surveillance system can benefit future planning, legislation and implementation in other states and/or surveillance of other acute and chronic health conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood obesity has emerged as a leading health concern in the 21st century. Current data sources from which childhood obesity estimates are derived in most systems are primarily cross-sectional, are from small sample sizes, and/or have limited generalizability. Large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, which provide unprecedented opportunities for individual and population health surveillance. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods to increase the use of large EHR data for childhood obesity prevention purposes, extending the scope of public health surveillance.",Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data,9328110,R21HD086754,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family Practice', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Municipalities', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'population based', 'population health', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'user friendly software']",NICHD,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2017,259287,0.11097721037226302
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9341673,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment effect', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2017,589358,0.17716837996132806

"Genome Wide Association Study for Childhood Obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which in turn has serious complications including accelerated development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade.  We previously successfully argued in our application for the R01 HD056465 award that distillation of the genetic component in this complex phenotype should thus be easier to determine in children, where environmental exposure and impact has been for a relatively short period of their lifetime; indeed the resulting work did pan out to be successful in this regard. We carried out a non-hypothesis-driven study that was directed at uncovering genes and genetic variants that predispose to childhood obesity by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a high density tag-SNP array. Employing a powered two-stage study design in a consortium setting, where cases were defined as being in the e95th percentile of BMI, we identified novel association signals which we subsequently replicated. This NICHD funded study was ultimately published in Nature Genetics (with the PI as senior author) and received widespread press attention, including with CNN, Time and the front page of USA Today.  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is now poised to determine additional genetic factors conferring risk to the pathogenesis of childhood obesity through the leveraging of new ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology, and also allow for fine-mapping of the already uncovered loci to determine the actual causal mechanism of action. Combining our accurately phenotyped cohort, which represents the largest pediatric obesity DNA collection in the world, with access to familial childhood obesity, availability of existing genome wide singl nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and the application of whole exome sequencing, this renewal application of R01 HD056465 proposes to broaden the list of novel genetic loci that are associated with this trait in order to get further insights in to the genetic etiology of common pediatric obesity.  We are well positioned to extend our knowledge of the genetic etiology of childhood obesity. It is unclear if these additional variants are common in the population, a set o private mutations in families or a mixture of both. Irrespective of the nature of the variant(s) we are well positioned to look for both types of event, with common variants detectable through leveraging the GWAS dataset of well powered cohorts and private mutations detectable through whole exome sequencing of many multi-case pedigrees. This represents a major follow-up to the Principal Investigator's original grant application and this renewal will allow for adding extr value to the already substantial findings made funded by the original grant.

"Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Excess body fat is a key underlying factor in the development of numerous chronic diseases, including type II diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. The AMA recently declared that obesity, itself, is a disease. Most epidemiologic studies utilize Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify people as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese because it is a convenient and simple method that has been shown to correlate with disease risk. Since the majority of the health risks associated with obesity are more directly linked to an overabundance of body fat than weight, measuring body fat is essential for more precise guidelines. However, accurate methods of assessing body fat are expensive, inconvenient, and require immobile equipment. Consequently, the AMA has called for more cost effective and convenient methods to assess body composition to assist doctors in their assessment and treatment. Virtual modeling of humans in particular has provided ways to scan and analyze the body and its motion. Supervised Machine Learning (SML), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, has made great progress in taking measured data to infer new relationships. It is our belief that virtual modeling and SML can provide the techniques necessary to conveniently and accurately calculate the percentage of body fat (%BF) and to provide new tools in treating obesity based on body shapes. The project will develop a system that uses commercially available depth cameras such as the Microsoft Kinect(r) to capture the surface of the human body. This will be accomplished by developing a new algorithm to perform deformable registration of several RGB-Depth views of the body. A new algorithm that uses SML will be developed to calculate percentage body fat using the surface data. The system will be trained and validated by collecting data from a number of subjects. The surface captured will be used to explore the role of visual body representation in motivation and adherence. The developed systems can be implemented in clinical or personal settings and be utilized as a public health research tool and deployed widely given the low-cost of the hardware required. In addition to the immediate impact that the system will have on managing obesity, the project will have a broad impact on a number of areas. A large database of such shapes captured over time may lead to ways to predict how an individual's body shape will change given a particular intervention. Certain medical conditions that result in body shape change, such as those involving lymphatic circulations, may be diagnosed and tracked more easily. Growth patterns of children may be tracked by change of body shapes. Further research can be conducted to determine the effect of body shape on %BF using data mining techniques. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The project will develop a new method to capture the 3D surface and shape of a human body and a new method to use these data to calculate percent body fat. By making these tools widely available and economical, the proposed approach has the potential for major contributions in the assessment and treatment of obesity.",Calculation of Percent Body Fat by Analyzing Virtual Body Models,9099872,R21HL124443,"['Adherence', 'Age', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Belief', 'Body Composition', 'Body Size', 'Body Surface', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Equipment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Imagery', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Muscle', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Plethysmography', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Self Perception', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underweight', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Water', 'Weight', 'Weights and Measures', 'base', 'body density', 'body volume', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'density', 'disorder risk', 'lymphatic circulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'obesity treatment', 'preference', 'public health research', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'study population', 'tool', 'virtual', 'weight loss intervention']",NHLBI,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2016,194340,0.06145886716977266
"Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity is associated with high financial cost and increased morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Health care spending due to obesity is estimated to be as high as \$210 billion annually, or 21\% of total national spending. A childhood obesity surveillance system will discern disparities, detect aberrant signals, design targeted interventions, and track change over time. In addition to national public health surveillance systems, local data are increasingly necessary to reflect regional trends. Current systems in Wisconsin are subject to (1) bias estimation of obesity rates, (2) limited data in school-aged children ages 5-10 years, (3) insufficient power to estimate disparities in local subgroups, and (4) limited ability to track local changes over time. Therefore, the impact of investments and collective efforts in Wisconsin childhood obesity prevention has been difficult to measure. This, in turn, demands approaches that overcome and transcend the posited limitations. Since large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, there has been a paradigm shift and accelerated improvements in the use of EHR data for the purpose of population health promotion and tracking of progress. The University of Wisconsin Population Health Information Exchange (PHINEX) database contains de- identified EHR data from a multicenter healthcare system located primarily in south central Wisconsin. In partnership with The Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative, we aim to create an EHR model for a childhood obesity prevention surveillance system. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods using the platform of PHINEX for childhood obesity prevention purposes. This enhance and extend surveillance activities of childhood obesity conditions, and increase the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions aimed at changing policies, systems, and environments associated with childhood obesity. We plan to address the following aims: (1) robust estimation of the spatiotemporal prevalence at area level, (2) hot spot detection on areas with aberrant obesity incidence, and (3) prediction for childhood weight gain phenotypes. The developed and implemented surveillance system can benefit future planning, legislation and implementation in other states and/or surveillance of other acute and chronic health conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Childhood obesity has emerged as a leading health concern in the 21st century. Current data sources from which childhood obesity estimates are derived in most systems are primarily cross-sectional, are from small sample sizes, and/or have limited generalizability. Large electronic health records (EHRs) systems have been developed to routinely collect information over time, which provide unprecedented opportunities for individual and population health surveillance. We propose to develop innovative statistical machine learning methods to increase the use of large EHR data for childhood obesity prevention purposes, extending the scope of public health surveillance.            ",Childhood obesity surveillance using electronic health records data,9018958,R21HD086754,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Area', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Family Practice', 'Financial cost', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hot Spot', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Surveillance', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'School-Age Population', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smiling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Weight Gain', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data structure', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'population based', 'population health', 'public health intervention', 'public health relevance', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'user friendly software']",NICHD,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R21,2016,234419,0.11097721037226302
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity        ",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9108126,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2016,190342,0.16429922301088185

"Genome Wide Association Study for Childhood Obesity     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which in turn has serious complications including accelerated development of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade.  We previously successfully argued in our application for the R01 HD056465 award that distillation of the genetic component in this complex phenotype should thus be easier to determine in children, where environmental exposure and impact has been for a relatively short period of their lifetime; indeed the resulting work did pan out to be successful in this regard. We carried out a non-hypothesis-driven study that was directed at uncovering genes and genetic variants that predispose to childhood obesity by conducting a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a high density tag-SNP array. Employing a powered two-stage study design in a consortium setting, where cases were defined as being in the e95th percentile of BMI, we identified novel association signals which we subsequently replicated. This NICHD funded study was ultimately published in Nature Genetics (with the PI as senior author) and received widespread press attention, including with CNN, Time and the front page of USA Today.  The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia is now poised to determine additional genetic factors conferring risk to the pathogenesis of childhood obesity through the leveraging of new ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology, and also allow for fine-mapping of the already uncovered loci to determine the actual causal mechanism of action. Combining our accurately phenotyped cohort, which represents the largest pediatric obesity DNA collection in the world, with access to familial childhood obesity, availability of existing genome wide singl nucleotide polymorphism genotypes and the application of whole exome sequencing, this renewal application of R01 HD056465 proposes to broaden the list of novel genetic loci that are associated with this trait in order to get further insights in to the genetic etiology of common pediatric obesity.  We are well positioned to extend our knowledge of the genetic etiology of childhood obesity. It is unclear if these additional variants are common in the population, a set o private mutations in families or a mixture of both. Irrespective of the nature of the variant(s) we are well positioned to look for both types of event, with common variants detectable through leveraging the GWAS dataset of well powered cohorts and private mutations detectable through whole exome sequencing of many multi-case pedigrees. This represents a major follow-up to the Principal Investigator's original grant application and this renewal will allow for adding extr value to the already substantial findings made funded by the original grant.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The prevalence of obesity in children and adults in the United States has increased by more than 30% over the past decade.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects. Other specific aims of the project include the application of the proposed methods to two national data sets collected, respectively, from the Louisiana Child Health Study and the Heartbeat! Project, and the dissemination of a user-friendly software program for increasing the potential impact of the project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a social epidemic, childhood obesity is the result of the interaction between many levels of personal behavior and risk factors, as well as obesogenic ecological factors that span many sources, including families, schools, and communities. Using a broad and interdisciplinary team of clinical and methodology scientists, this project develops advanced analytic tools that could help clinicians better understand the mechanisms of how multiple levels of risk factors lead to childhood obesity, including the relative importance of the risk factors.

"OTHER FUNCTIONS SBIR TOPIC 308, PHASE I: THE MOBILE FOOD INTAKE PHOTO STORAGE AN This proposal describes plans to enhance Viocare¿s Mobile Food Intake Visual and Voice Recognizer (FIVR) System. FIVR, an active Genes, Environment and Health Initiative (GEI) project, is a novel combination of innovative technologies including computer vision and speech recognition to measure dietary intake using a mobile phone. Version 1 of FIVR uses a mobile phone¿s embedded camera to capture a short video of food to be consumed. The food to be eaten is annotated verbally on the mobile phone by the user. These video and audio files are sent to a backend server for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. This project will develop specifications to extend FIVR¿s capabilities to standardize, store, and analyze more diverse food images, such as 3D photos; to collect other food data; to enhance the analysis tools; and for interfaces to a variety of clinical/research systems. The FIVR Version 2 functional prototype will be developed to use 3D dietary images as input. A final evaluation of the FIVR V2 prototype will be conducted to assess the accuracy and feasibility of the 3D image diet capture with a group of 9 subjects in a controlled feeding study. n/a","OTHER FUNCTIONS SBIR TOPIC 308, PHASE I: THE MOBILE FOOD INTAKE PHOTO STORAGE AN",8554263,61201200042C,"['Car Phone', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary intake', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Food', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Phase', 'Reporting', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'System', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'feeding', 'innovative technologies', 'novel', 'prototype', 'speech recognition', 'tool']",NCI,"VIOCARE, INC.",N43,2012,200000,0.08939787674980175

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations.

"Dynamic Multichain Graphical Models for the Analysis of Childhood Obesity Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to develop targeted strategies and methods for solving challenging methodological problems in the analysis of data on childhood obesity. Of special interest are statistical and computational models that can attend to the multiple levels of risk behaviors and risk factors that are deemed to be direct or indirect causes of childhood obesity. The multilevel perspective can be captured  through a behavioral-social-ecological conceptual model in which personal factors, beliefs; taste  preferences; dietary composition; environmental factors such as homes, schools, and food availability;  societal factors such as cultural norms; and physiological factors such as intrauterine and genetic disposition are included either as factors in causal chains explaining childhood obesity or as so-called risk regulators (a set of stable ecological conditions) that up- and down-regulate probabilities of  obesogenic outcomes. In order to operationalize and implement the conceptual multilevel model, we propose to build, around a core technology that we call the Dynamic Multi-chain Graphical Model (DMGM), a set of related strategies and methods for (1) the preprocessing of data, and (2) the modeling of multiple causal pathways to obesity. The DMGM separates direct risk factors and risk regulators into two distinct spaces the so-called causal space and the regulatory space. Interest in the mechanism-based model within the causal space focuses on the joint distribution of direct risk factors.  Alternatively, risk regulators within the regulatory space affect the system of variables in the causal space through regression-based models imposed upon system parameters; the joint distribution of regressors, however, is of little interest here. By capitalizing on the conceptual and computational advantages offered by the segregation of the causal and regulatory spaces, the DMGM is able to handle three or more levels of data, to the extent to which direct and indirect risk variables can be identified. Other strategies are also available for handling multiple levels of data within a specific space.  Besides the DMGM, this project will also include the development of a number of other tools that are especially designed to address the analytical complexity that childhood obesity researchers often encounter in their empirical work. The toolkit includes a recursive-partition-based decision tree that can handle temporal data, a functional data-analysis tool for processing history data, and latent-variable models for summarizing multiple measurements and handling within-space clustering effects.

"Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., with 66% of adults overweight and 32% of adults obese. The research uses the new technique of three-dimensional  (3 D) photonic scanning to create and validate an instrument that  rapidly  assesses  obesity  in  clinical  and  field  settings.  The  first  aim  is  to develop a portable computer vision system of body imaging for 3 D surface imaging of the human body. The hardware system is designed from off-the- shelf components such as digital cameras, projectors, and personal computer. Algorithms for the 3D data are being developed and refined for calculation and system calibration for a small instrument. The second aim is to develop algorithms for surface reconstruction from 3D data in order to define a proper surface representation and to reconstruct a 3D model of the human body from incomplete and noisy data. The third aim begins the human measurement testing in 120 adults. Aim 3 is to estimate the size and shape of the reconstructed human body by a portable body imager and compare to current methods that assess obesity. Anthropometric parameters will be computed by a 3 second body scan via imaging and then compared to other methods of obesity assessment including BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, bioimpedence, hydrodensitometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography. The final aim is to validate body imaging as an indicator of central obesity (fat in the abdominal region, as opposed to subcutaneous depots) in a subset of 60 subjects because it is the abdominal fat that is most associated with health risks such as diabetes. Abdominal fat tissue as detected by magnetic resonance imaging scans will be compared to that calculated from 3 D body imaging.

"Automating assessment of obesity care quality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current trends suggest that obesity prevalence will continue to rise and that costs of treating obesity-related disease will dramatically increase as the population ages. Despite NHLBI guidelines for preventing, diagnosing, and treating obesity among adults, most health care systems have been slow to respond to this looming public health problem. This slow response is partly due to the inability to assess adherence to obesity diagnosis and treatment guidelines. In particular, the lack of appropriate Health IT for integrating diverse clinical data on obesity, even within state-of-the-art electronic medical record systems (EMRs), makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of care, measure the effectiveness of new intervention programs, and make rational decisions at system, organization, and individual patient levels. EMRs offer the potential to efficiently assess large populations, however much of the data necessary for obesity care assessment are unavailable to automated methods because they reside in the text clinical notes of the EMR. Previous studies have shown that although some data of interest are recorded in easily retrievable fields (e.g., body weights recorded as a vital sign; standard diagnosis codes), much of the treatment information is found only in free-text clinical notes. This research aims to develop, validate, apply, and evaluate a scalable method for routine and comprehensive measurement of outpatient obesity care quality. To accomplish this, we will extend MediClass (a ""Medical Classifier""), which is a proven technology for extracting care quality data from both coded data and free-text clinical notes in the EMR. This research will perform retrospective analysis of adult primary care from the EMR data of two distinct health systems: a   mid-sized HMO (Kaiser Permanente Northwest, KPNW) and a consortium of public health clinics (OCHIN) including a diverse sample of patients, providers, and health care practices of the West Coast states (primarily Oregon, but also Washington and California). We propose to use Health IT to integrate diverse data and knowledge that advance quality improvement for both insured and the indigent, uninsured, and underinsured populations of this region. We will first develop obesity care quality (OCQ) measures using up to-date NHLBI guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of obesity. Next, we will develop and validate an automated method for applying these measures to comprehensive EMR data. At each study site, the Medi Class system will extract coded data and use natural language processing (NLP) on free-text clinical notes to identify OCQ-relevant clinical events in the EMR. Then we will apply the OCQ measures to assess current levels of obesity care quality in the two health systems. Finally, we will evaluate the associations between OCQ measures of recommended obesity care and provider characteristics as well as clinical outcomes for patients, including change in weight.           PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will improve care for obese and overweight patients by improving the technology we use for measuring the quality of care for these populations.

"Mobile Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognize (FIVR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Inadequate dietary intake assessment tools hamper studying relationships between diet and disease. Methods suitable for use in large epidemiologic studies (e.g., dietary recall, food diaries, and food frequency questionnaires) are subject to considerable inaccuracy, and more accurate methods (e.g., metabolic ward studies, doubly-labeled water) are prohibitively costly and/or labor-intensive for use in population-based studies. A simple, inexpensive and convenient, yet valid, dietary measurement tool is needed to provide more accurate determination of dietary intake in populations. We therefore propose a three-phase project to develop and test a new assessment tool called FIVR (Food Intake Visualization and Voice Recognizer) that uses a novel combination of innovative technologies: advanced voice recognition, visualization techniques, and adaptive user modeling in an electronic system to automatically record and evaluate food intake. FIVR uses cell phones to capture both voice recordings and photographs of dietary intake in real-time. These dual sources of data are sent to a database server for recognition processing for real-time food recognition and portion size measurement through speech recognition and image analysis. The user model will allow for enhanced identification of food and method of preparation in situations that images alone might not produce accurate results as the system learns through experience and adapts to the individual's food patterns.

"Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Obesity has reached epidemic levels in the U.S., with 66% of adults overweight and 32% of adults obese. The research uses the new technique of three-dimensional  (3 D) photonic scanning to create and validate an instrument that  rapidly  assesses  obesity  in  clinical  and  field  settings.  The  first  aim  is  to develop a portable computer vision system of body imaging for 3 D surface imaging of the human body. The hardware system is designed from off-the- shelf components such as digital cameras, projectors, and personal computer. Algorithms for the 3D data are being developed and refined for calculation and system calibration for a small instrument. The second aim is to develop algorithms for surface reconstruction from 3D data in order to define a proper surface representation and to reconstruct a 3D model of the human body from incomplete and noisy data. The third aim begins the human measurement testing in 120 adults. Aim 3 is to estimate the size and shape of the reconstructed human body by a portable body imager and compare to current methods that assess obesity. Anthropometric parameters will be computed by a 3 second body scan via imaging and then compared to other methods of obesity assessment including BMI, waist circumference, sagittal abdominal diameter, bioimpedence, hydrodensitometry, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and air displacement plethysmography. The final aim is to validate body imaging as an indicator of central obesity (fat in the abdominal region, as opposed to subcutaneous depots) in a subset of 60 subjects because it is the abdominal fat that is most associated with health risks such as diabetes. Abdominal fat tissue as detected by magnetic resonance imaging scans will be compared to that calculated from 3 D body imaging. In sum, the non-contact, noninvasive nature of this new portable body scanner will produce a quick, inexpensive and objective measure of body size and type of obesity.             n/a",Validation and Evaluation of a Portable Body Scanner for Determination of Obesity,7495057,R21DK081206,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Body Image', 'Body Size', 'Body fat', 'Body measure procedure', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Central obesity', 'Clinical', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Height', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Personal Computers', 'Plethysmography', 'Population Study', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Skeletal system', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Sum', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Tissues', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Validation', 'abdominal fat', 'design', 'digital', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'photonics', 'reconstruction', 'size', 'subcutaneous', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'waist circumference']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2008,15000,0.129227550126972

"Computer Vision Methods for the Real Time Assessment of Dietary Intake    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a leading cause of preventable death and disability in the U.S. Self- monitoring of all foods and beverages consumed is central to weight loss and maintenance efforts; however, this places a heavy burden on the user. These same burdens also impede nutritional research. The proposed research is for the testing of a semi-automated, objective, near real-time computer vision and pattern recognition approach to the measurement of dietary intake. In the proposed product, cell phone pictures of meals and snacks will be analyzed by software in an attempt to automatically recognize as many items as possible. A small number of intelligent yes/no questions will help provide additional information when necessary in order to meet the accuracy demands of the target application. Following identification of the items, the software will estimate the portion sizes of all identified items. The experiments comprising this Phase I SBIR are (a) extract the most informative sets of features using a large number of food and beverage items taken from an existing database of real world meal images, (b) compare the accuracy of candidate pattern recognition approaches to identify items based on the extracted features, (c) identify the most feasible algorithms for estimating portion size, and (d) test usability and user acceptance with a simulated version of the product. Phase II will (a) apply the approach to a greater variety of food and beverage items, (b) improve automated analysis, and (c) compare the approach to existing assessment instruments.

"Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The prevalence of obesity in developed countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Obesity contributes to an increased risk of heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and some cancers and is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this research is to investigate application of novel noninvasive devices and pattern recognition methods to perform studies of human food intake behavior and produce objective estimates of volumetric and caloric food intake that will be relevant for identifying effective measures to treat or prevent diseases like obesity. Such devices and methods could extend our understanding of causes of obesity, and the monitoring devices created in this study could be used for monitoring of obese patients and as a part of a therapy potentially improve quality of life and decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with obesity. The goal of this study is to design and perform a pilot investigation which will provide preliminary data that objective observations of mastication (chewing) and deglutition (swallowing) by a wearable, non-intrusive monitoring device can provide statistically reliable estimates of eating habits by providing objective measures of delution frequency, duration of mastication and identifying periods of food intake with sufficient sensitivity and specificity.  The aims of the proposed research include design of the wearable sensors and associated signal processing methods; development of pattern recognition methodologies that will automatically detect instances of delution and mastication from sensor recordings; development of pattern recognition methods to automatically identify periods of food intake based on detected chewing and swallowing; and to validate these device and methodologies on a group of human subjects.

Modern methods of computational intelligence such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic will be used along with statistical methods to achieve the highest 'accuracy of pattern recognition. n/a",Detection of chewing and swallowing to estimate eating patterns and energy intake,7022662,R21HL083052,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavior test', 'bioenergetics', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'biomedical automation', 'biomedical equipment development', 'biosensor device', 'biotechnology', 'caloric dietary content', 'calorimetry', 'clinical biomedical equipment', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'disease /disorder prevention /control', 'human morbidity', 'human subject', 'mastication', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nutrient intake activity', 'nutrition related tag', 'obesity', 'portable biomedical equipment', 'quality of life', 'statistics /biometry', 'swallowing']",NHLBI,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R21,2005,217756,0.1297029236705382

"LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stottler Henke Associates in collaboration with Teachers College, Columbia University, proposes to build a software system for teaching scientific inquiry in the context of nutrition science, The goal of the proposed research is to develop a computer based instructional system - called LiFESim - that teaches accurate and detailed information about food and the food system -- from production of food on the farm through food processing and transportation, to impacts of food on personal health and on the natural environment in terms of waste and pollution. The software will complement an existing health science curriculum, developed at Teachers College for 4th-6th graders, called ""Linking Food and the Environment"" or LIFE, developed from an NIH Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) RR 12374 (1997-2004). Our system will be based on the paradigm of role-playing simulation used in such popular computer games as SimCity and The Sims: students using the software assume roles in a simulated environment and learn from the consequences of the decisions that they make in those roles. Using the simulation paradigm students will be able to explore the dynamics of large-scale systems, such as those the food transportation system in ways that are not possible with the existing curriculum. For example, the simulation would allow students to explore the impact of changes in transportation patterns on food delivery. Our system will provide explicit coaching in applying scientific methods for investigation. We will also explore learning strategies that will encourage students to critically examine - and hopefully improve - their dietary choices. We will complement simulation-based learning with two other artificial intelligence based methodologies - the use of lifelike pedagogical agents, and the use of case-based reasoning. During Phase I, we will develop a set of detailed instructional goals, use these to develop an initial system design, develop a limited prototype of the system, and then develop and perform an informal pilot study to evaluate the viability of our design. The pilot study will be conducted over a one-month period at schools in Hayward, California and New York City. Our Phase II effort will focus on developing an extensive design and performing detailed use testing of the system developed during Phase I.         n/a",LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR),6790401,R43RR019780,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'environmental contamination', 'food', 'food processing /preparation', 'health education', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrition', 'nutrition related tag', 'science education']",NCRR,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2004,100000,0.10942104353149974

"WEIGHT MANAGEMENT EXPERT SYSTEMS FOR DIABETES Approximately 90% of individuals with NIDDM are overweight. Overweight can exacerbate the course of the disease and co-morbid conditions, increasing health care utilization, morbidity, and mortality. Clinic-based programs for weight management are costly and serve only a small percentage of at risk individuals. Thus, population-based behavior change programs may be necessary to reach larger percentages of at risk individuals more cost- effectively. Preliminary research on the application of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) to health behaviors involved in weight management suggests that the model has the potential to guide the development of effective multiple-behavior interventions. Phase I of this Fast-Track proposal involves the customization and feasibility test of a stage-matched, individualized, interactive intervention based on the TTM. Feasibility includes proactively recruiting 50% of eligible participants (n=300) to participate in a randomized clinical trial of a comprehensive weight management expert system intervention and evaluating acceptability of the intervention materials. Computerized expert system interventions and stage-matched manuals delivered proactively to entire populations can have unprecedented impacts on the targeted health behaviors as well as weight. Using the TTM as the basis will provide the theoretical and individualized framework that experts in the area have indicated is necessary to develop more effective and cost- effective interventions. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Overweight and obesity are costly to all participants in the health care delivery system. Over 90% of the 15 million adults with NIDDM are overweight, which increases healthcare utilization, morbidity, and mortality.

"AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition ABSTRACT Dietary intake is a complex human behavior that drives disease risk and corresponding economic and healthcare burdens worldwide. Poor diet is the leading cause of death in the US and a known driver of obesity – a global epidemic. A major contributor to poor diet is food eaten away from home, such as restaurant foods. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods. Accurate approaches and tools to evaluate food and nutrient intake are essential in monitoring the nutritional status of individuals. There is a critical need for real-time data capture that minimizes burden and reduces error. While progress has been made, there is no tool available that accurately and automatically estimates foods left unconsumed in a meal. Two major limitations of existing systems is the reliance of a fiducial marker for food detection and volume estimation, and reliance on humans – either the respondent or a trained researcher – to estimate the portion of food leftover. This application leverages novel technology to remove those limitations. The long-term research goal is to utilize digital imaging (DI), artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) techniques to develop a novel hybrid methodology for rapid, accurate measurement of dietary intake. To attain this goal, our objective in this R21 application is to refine and test a system architecture that (a) uses digital images to record dietary intake in real-time and (b) uses AI and CV techniques to identify food/beverage items and determine amounts leftover. We plan to build on our current prototype in which digital food images are captured before and after the meal, analyzed to detect the food items, a three-dimensional (3-D) virtual model constructed, and volume remaining after the meal estimated, which will be used to calculate the amount leftover based on the initial volume. Volume consumed will be converted to weight and linked to public-use nutrition information. These calorie estimates will be compared against calories those from (a) DIs coded by trained research staff and (b) weighed plate waste methodology. Our expectation is to develop a valid system architecture for rapidly estimating dietary intake. The outcome of this proposal is expected to have a significant positive impact, enabling nutrition and health researchers to collect high-quality food consumption data in real world settings, increasing knowledge of dietary patterns and improving capacity to assess dietary interventions. This work will lead to an R01 application that will expand food types and meal settings and test the utility of our system among consumers. Project Narrative Solutions to address the global obesity epidemic are urgently needed. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods, a known driver of obesity. This study integrates nutrition science, computer science, and engineering to develop and test a new method for assessing dietary intake, and if successful would yield a rapid, reliable, accurate and cost- effective tool.",AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition,9978495,R21CA250024,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Science', 'Nutritional status', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respondent', 'Restaurants', 'Side', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'food quality', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'prototype', 'success', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'virtual model', 'wasting', 'weight maintenance']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R21,2020,222002,0.1608364684020027
"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,9829561,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer science', 'craving', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2020,165045,0.13891493876609728

This work is critical for enriching the understanding of healthy development and for broadening the foundations of behavioral data science. ARFID ·motivates the development of new computer vision and data analysis tools critical for the analysis of multidimensional behavioral data. The main aims are: 1. Develop and user individualized and integrated continuous facial affect coding from videos to discern affective motivations for food avoidance, critical due to the unique sensory aspects of eating disorders, and resulting from active stimulation via friendly and carefully designed images/videos and real food presentation; 2. Use data analysis and machine learning to derive sensory profiles based on patterns of food consumption and preference from existing unique datasets of selective eaters; and 3. Translate the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 into the clinic and home to assess the capacity of these tools to define a threshold of clinically significant food avoidance, to detect change in acceptability of food with repeated presentations, and to examine and modify the accuracy of our food suggestion algorithms. Broader Impacts: The impact of this application comprises two broad domains. First is the derivation of processes, tools, and strategies to analyze very disparate data across multiple levels of analysis and to codify those strategies to inform similar future work, in particular incorporating automatic behavioral coding. Second is the exploitation of these tools to address questions about the emergence of healthy/unhealthy food selectivity across the lifespan, including recommendation delivery via apps and at-home recordings. The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

The health impact of even partial success in this project is very broad and significant. Undergraduate students will be involved in this project via the 6-weeks summer research program at the Information Initiative at Duke, a center dedicated to the fundamentals of data science and its applications; via the co-Pl's research lab devoted to eating disorders; and via the Pl's project dedicated to training undergraduate students to address eating disorders of their friends via an anonymous app. Outreach and dissemination will follow the broad use of the developed app, both in the clinic and the general population, including the Pl's connections with low-income and under-represented bi-lingual preK. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Eating disorders are potentially life-threatening mental illnesses affecting the general population; -90% of individuals never receive treatment, in part due to lack of awareness and access. Individuals with eating disorders experience a diminished quality of life, high mental and physical illness comorbidities, and an existence marked by profound loneliness and isolation. Combining expertise in eating disorders with computer vision and machine learning, we bring for the first time data science to this health challenge.

"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,9963258,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Effectiveness', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,508751,0.10569008915099647
"Informing national guidelines on diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes SUMMARY The diet quality of U.S. childbearing aged women is worse now than any time in the last 50 years. Poor diet quality has been linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes that contribute to infant mortality and pose a tremendous societal burden. Nevertheless, formal recommendations on the diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes are lacking. The US Congress recently mandated that dietary advice for pregnancy be included in the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans—the major nutrition policy document that provides dietary advice for health promotion. The USDA/HHS Pregnancy Work Group, which included PI Lisa Bodnar, was charged with summarizing existing knowledge on diet patterns that support healthy pregnancy outcomes to inform the pregnancy-specific guidelines. They identified an evidence base that was entirely insufficient for deriving empirical recommendations and called for research to fill this critical knowledge gap. Our objective is to generate empirical evidence that will inform national dietary guidance on the diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes. We hypothesize that our results will suggest dietary recommendations for pregnant women that will diverge from prevailing nutrition advice. We expect this divergence because our innovative approaches will accommodate the complex synergy among foods in the diet. Using a large, prospective cohort of 7995 U.S. women enrolled at 8 U.S. academic centers, we will quantify the contribution of dietary patterns to variation in risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth <37 weeks, small-for-gestational-age birth, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia). We will use machine learning techniques that allow for complex interactions among dietary components. Then, we will generalize recommended dietary patterns in our sample to the U.S. population of pregnant women using cutting edge “transportability” methods developed in the causal inference literature. Finally, we will develop machine learning algorithms that will identify subgroups who will benefit most from dietary pattern recommendations. The successful completion of this project will provide the Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advisory Committee with empirically-derived data on the ideal dietary patterns for promoting healthy pregnancy outcomes. Our innovative methodologies will serve as a template for nutritional epidemiologists in other areas of health to apply to their data, leading to a broad impact on the Dietary Guidelines. Developing practical data-driven dietary recommendations to optimize pregnancy outcomes will help to reduce the high economic and societal burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve the health of mothers and their children. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE The Dietary Guidelines for Americans is the cornerstone of nutrition policy in the U.S., impacting WIC and other Federal nutrition assistance programs, health insurance incentives, weight and lifestyle interventions, policies to change the food environment, and nutrition education programs at the national, regional, state and local levels. This project will inform the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines by using cutting-edge analytic approaches to identify diet patterns that promote healthy outcomes of pregnancy. Although the causes of poor pregnancy outcomes are multifactorial, we focus on dietary intake because it is one of the few potentially modifiable risk factors, and has important implications for mother and child well beyond the childbearing years.",Informing national guidelines on diet patterns that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes,10026261,R01HD102313,"['Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'American', 'Area', 'Birth', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Child', 'Complex', 'Conceptions', 'Congresses', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diet', 'Dietary Component', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Health Promotion', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incentives', 'Infant Mortality', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mothers', 'Nulliparity', 'Nutrition Policy', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Requirements', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Oils', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Pattern', 'Planned Pregnancy', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse pregnancy outcome', 'child bearing', 'cohort', 'dietary control', 'dietary guidelines', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'food environment', 'fruits and vegetables', 'health of the mother', 'healthy pregnancy', 'improved', 'infant death', 'innovation', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'modifiable risk', 'nutrition', 'nutrition education', 'pregnant', 'programs', 'synergism', 'working group']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,645069,0.04996838965379967
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9912764,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2020,139614,0.14238283636751636
"Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Behavioral obesity treatment produces clinically significant weight loss and reduced disease risk/severity for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease. Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes, which can be largely attributed to lapses from the recommended diet. Our work has shown that dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals) are frequent during weight loss attempts (~3-4 times per week), associated with poorer weight losses, and triggered by momentary changing states (e.g., changes in mood or availability of palatable food). Thus, there is a clear need for innovative solutions that can provide dynamic in-the-moment interventions to improve adherence to the prescribed diet in obesity treatment. Our research team was the first to develop a smartphone-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) that includes: 1) daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling via mobile device) of relevant behavioral, psychological, and environmental triggers for lapse; 2) a machine learning algorithm that uses information gathered via EMA to determine real-time lapse risk; & 3) delivery of brief intervention during high-risk moments. Our pilot work revealed that the JITAI was feasible, acceptable, and produced reductions in average lapse frequency. However, we have not yet shown a direct effect of the JITAI on eating behavior in the moment of heightened lapse risk and know little about the types of interventions that are most effective for reducing lapse. We therefore propose to extend our research via a micro- randomized trial (MRT), a methodology that involves random assignment to intervention (or control) at a specific decision point, i.e., when our algorithm predicts heightened risk for a lapse. The MRT will determine whether a specific intervention in a specific moment had its intended effect. We will therefore port our JITAI to a more scalable online platform and conduct a MRT to evaluate the effects of a generic lapse risk alert message and theory-driven just-in-time interventions on dietary lapses. After refinement testing with n=15 to ensure proper technical functioning of our updated JITAI, adults with overweight/obesity (n=159) will participate in a well-established 12-week online obesity treatment program + JITAI, with 12 weeks of JITAI-only follow-up. When an individual is at risk for lapsing s/he will be randomized to no intervention, a generic risk alert, or one of 4 theory-driven interventions with interactive skills training. The outcome of interest will be the occurrence (or lack thereof) of dietary lapse, as measured both subjectively (i.e., via EMA) and objectively (i.e., via wrist- based intake monitoring), in the hours following randomization. Results of the MRT will inform an optimized algorithm for intervention delivery that will drive the finalized JITAI. A future RCT will compare weight loss in obesity treatment with and without the optimized JITAI. This highly innovative approach will advance the science of adherence by supporting the development of sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior and informing JITAIs that target adherence to other health behaviors (e.g., medication, activity goals). PROJECT NARRATIVE This project targets dietary lapses (specific instances of nonadherence to dietary goals), a major cause of poor outcomes during behavioral obesity treatment, which is recommended as a first-line intervention for cardiovascular disease. We propose to conduct a micro-randomized trial to empirically optimize a just-in-time adaptive intervention that monitors risk and intervenes on lapses as needed. By evaluating the immediate, proximal effect of four theory-driven interventions on lapse behavior, the project will: (a) produce a scalable, finalized JITAI that has the greatest potential to show clear clinical impact in future RCTs and pragmatic trials; and (b) inform the development of more sophisticated theoretical models of adherence behavior more broadly.",Optimizing Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention to Improve Dietary Adherence in Behavioral Obesity Treatment: A Micro-randomized Trial,10029156,R01HL153543,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Education', 'Energy Intake', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health behavior', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motivation', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Palate', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychological Factors', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Severities', 'Suggestion', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavioral adherence', 'brief intervention', 'clinically significant', 'dietary adherence', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'pilot trial', 'pragmatic trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'psychologic', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'skills training', 'theories', 'treatment program']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R01,2020,727923,0.12035754199442014
"Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract  In 2016, 47,000 individuals who initiated dialysis in the United States (~42% of all incident dialysis patients that year) had obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kilograms per meters squared. Across the BMI spectrum, individuals with kidney disease commonly lose weight after initiating dialysis treatment. However, whereas body weight typically stabilizes after the first several months of dialysis among patients without obesity, those with obesity often continue to lose weight. Both people with and without obesity who are on dialysis may lose weight due to muscle wasting and malnutrition, and recent studies have identified weight loss as a risk factor for death among people on dialysis, independent of BMI. Yet, some of the weight loss observed among obese dialysis patients may also reflect deliberate attempts to improve health, mobility, or access to kidney transplantation. Currently, there are no guidelines to help clinicians to differentiate between healthy and high-risk weight loss among people with obesity on dialysis. Further, typical obesity management paradigms are not easily transferrable to obese people with end-stage kidney disease, given factors such as chronic malnutrition, inflammation, and sarcopenia in this population that may modify the risks and benefits of different weight loss strategies. Therefore, the overarching goal of this five-year research proposal is to define healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes among people with obesity who are on dialysis, and to provide clinically feasible tools to improve obesity management in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. We will accomplish this goal by conducting three distinct but interrelated studies. In the first study, we will qualitatively determine patient-prioritized endpoints of weight loss, in addition to patient, physician and other stakeholder perspectives on the key factors that differentiate healthy from high-risk weight loss on dialysis. In the second study, we will leverage a national dataset of 23,000 obese dialysis patients and apply constructs of high and low physiologic reserve to derive healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes. We will then develop a weight- loss risk calculator tool that predicts the risks of hospitalization and death that are associated with each weight loss phenotype, using dynamic predictive joint models and machine learning techniques. In the third study, we will enroll 250 obese dialysis patients in a prospective, longitudinal study across five regions in the United States to evaluate the association between nutritional, inflammatory, and hemodynamic biomarkers and measures of health trajectory that are not typically captured in registry data, such as sarcopenia, dynapenia, body composition, and patient-prioritized endpoints such as quality of life. In accomplishing its aims, this research will provide urgently needed knowledge and tools that will improve the medical management of tens of thousands of people with end-stage kidney disease and obesity, ensuring that clinicians will be better able to incorporate patient-prioritized outcomes into assessments of weight loss interventions, and recognize and mitigate the effects of high-risk weight loss. Project Narrative Although over 40,000 obese individuals with end-stage kidney disease initiate dialysis each year in the United States, there are no guidelines on optimal obesity management in the setting of dialysis care. Obese dialysis patients may lose weight due to chronic illness or due to intentional weight loss attempts, though it is difficult to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss in these patients. This proposal seeks to advance the science of obesity management in dialysis settings by providing new tools to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss trajectories among obese dialysis patients.",Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease,9943129,R01DK124388,"['Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dietitian', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Kilogram', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Nephrology', 'Non obese', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Transplant Recipients', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'experience', 'hazard', 'health related quality of life', 'healthy weight', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity management', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'sleep quality', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,301998,0.1105233070305111
"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients. Commonly used dietary patterns are a priori diet score/index based on a set of dietary recommendations for a healthy diet (e.g., Mediterranean diet, Healthy Eating Index) or data-driven dietary patterns (e.g., prudent diet, western diet). Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional. The proposed study provides an excellent opportunity to develop new dietary patterns that capture eating behaviors such as when we eat and how often we eat during a day. The findings of the study about healthy eating patterns will also improve dietary recommendations by adding messages on when and how often to eat during a day.",TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS,9830609,R01CA226937,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anthropometry', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calories', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Evaluation', 'Fasting', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'dietary guidelines', 'doubly-labeled water', 'epidemiology study', 'food consumption', 'good diet', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'prudent diet', 'tool', 'vector', 'waist circumference', 'western diet']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,396585,0.08165582567489171
"Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity,10022151,K99HD100593,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Cholesterol', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'data reduction', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'energy balance', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'metabolic rate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'obstetrical complication', 'population based', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'sex', 'skills', 'vector', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K99,2020,108600,0.06638739507774402
"Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience 7. Abstract Obesity and intake of certain foods increases cancer risk, but the most common treatment (behavioral weight loss programs) rarely produces lasting weight loss and eating behavior change, apparently because caloric restriction increases the reward value of food and prompts energy-sparing adaptations. Interventions that reduce the implicit valuation of cancer-risk foods (e.g., red meats, refined sugar) may be more effective. Emerging data suggest that behavioral response training and cognitive reappraisal training reduce valuation of such foods, which leads to decrease intake of these foods and weight loss. Internalized incentive value is reflected in a ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex valuation system (“vmPFC”), which encodes the implicit reward value of food and is central to a reinforcement cycle that perpetuates unhealthy eating. Thus, the vmPFC valuation system is a promising target for intervention because changes to the system might disrupt the unhealthy reinforcement cycle. Interestingly, various interventions influence the vmPFC through distinct pathways. Behavioral training alters motor input to valuation regions, whereas cognitive training relies on lateral prefrontal “top-down” regions. The proposed translational neuroscience experiment will compare the efficacy with which two novel treatments cause lasting change in food valuation, and whether a composite of theory-based baseline individual differences in relevant processes (such as response tendencies and cognitive styles) moderate treatment effects. We will randomize 300 overweight/obese adults who are at risk for eating- and obesity-related cancers to behavioral response training toward healthy foods and away from cancer-risk foods, a cognitive reappraisal intervention focused on cancer-risk foods, or non–food inhibitory control training. Aim 1 compares the efficacy and mechanisms of action of these two interventions to reduce valuation of cancer-risk foods relative to the active control condition, using neural, behavioral, self-report, and physiological measures of the process and outcomes. Aim 2 is to establish the temporal pattern and durability of the effects across time ; food intake and habits , body fat, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio will be measured pre, post, and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Aim 3 uses machine learning to build and validate a low-cost, easy-to-administer composite that predicts whether and for how long an individual is likely to respond to intervention, and to which treatment. We hypothesize that self-report measures specifically related to valuation (e.g., willingness-to-pay) and to intervention-specific pathways to valuation (e.g., behavioral response tendencies, cognitive style) will predict differential response. Discovering these individual differences will provide a practical, low-cost tool to help interventionists “match” a given person to an effective treatment for that person . This project is very innovative because no study has directly compared the distinct and common effects of these treatments on valuation, used brain imaging to study the mechanism of effects, tested whether these interventions produce a lasting change in food valuation and body fat, or built and validated a composite that moderates response . 8. Project Narrative Excessive eating of energy-dense and obesity are risk factors for a range of cancers. There are programs to reduce intake of these foods and weight loss, but the effects of the programs rarely last. This project tests whether altering the value of cancer-risk foods can create lasting change, and uses neuroimaging to compare the efficacy of two programs to engage the valuation system on a neural level. Results will establish the pathways through which the programs work and suggest specific treatments for individuals based on a personalized profile.",Devaluing Energy-Dense Foods for Cancer Control: Translational Neuroscience,9988193,R01CA211224,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body fat', 'Body mass index', 'Brain imaging', 'Caloric Restriction', 'Calories', 'Cancer Control', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Food', 'Food Habits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Health Food', 'High-Risk Cancer', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated cancer', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Route', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Work', 'active control', 'adult obesity', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral response', 'cancer risk', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cognitive training', 'common treatment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experimental arm', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity risk', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sugar', 'theories', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'weight loss program', 'willingness to pay']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2020,771233,0.17716837996132806
"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI.

"Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY  Obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease that affects 39% of adults in the U.S. Obesity rates are disproportionately rising among women and contribute to increasing rates of diabetes and CV mortality among women younger than 55 years. Pregnancy represents a life transition when many women gain excess weight. The effect of obesity is further magnified in women with preeclampsia, an independent and underappreciated risk factor for future CV disease. There is a pressing need to better understand predictors of excessive postpartum weight retention in order to deliver effective and scalable weight loss interventions during a period when women at highest risk may be particularly receptive to lifestyle change.  Social incentives, or the influences that impact behavior change based on relationships, are strong motivators of healthy behavior. The use of game design elements, such as goal-setting, has been successfully combined with social incentives to enhance healthy behavior in other disease settings. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a behavioral intervention using these novel approaches, combined with an established behavioral weight loss program, will provide an effective, and scalable solution to reduce the incidence of postpartum obesity. This proposal will leverage mentorship of senior investigators (Drs. Michal Elovitz and Peter Groeneveld) and Penn’s mature research programs in cardiovascular medicine, maternal fetal medicine, and behavioral economics. Research will be conducted in an urban and racially diverse population since these women are most likely to benefit from interventions to reduce CV risk. Aim 1 will use robust statistical methods and machine learning to create a clinical prediction tool for postpartum weight retention in an existing electronic health record database enriched with neighborhood-level data. Aim 2 will use qualitative and mixed methods to identify strategies to enhance the design of a pilot intervention using patient feedback. Aim 3 will implement a 2-arm single site randomized clinical trial to achieve weight loss in women with preeclampsia or gestational hypertension participating in an online behavioral weight loss program using remote technology and social feedback from other postpartum women.  This proposal will identify women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and will test and refine interventions that are able to be disseminated to postpartum women remotely. Dr. Lewey is a general cardiologist trained in women’s health and population science with established expertise in pregnancy associated cardiovascular disorders. The training she proposes in advanced statistical methods, qualitative analysis, and behavioral clinical trial design will position her to become a leader in women’s cardiovascular health. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions to prevent heart disease in women. The results of the proposed K23 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. PROJECT NARRATIVE The postpartum period represents a unique time in a women’s life when many women gain excess weight and make the transition to becoming overweight or obese. We propose to rigorously study predictors of postpartum obesity and evaluate an innovative approach to improve weight loss in the postpartum period using an online behavioral weight loss program and social feedback from a team of other postpartum women. By identifying women at an early stage in life who will benefit the most from intensive lifestyle changes and testing interventions that are low cost, sustainable, and remotely delivered, we hope to significantly improve cardiovascular health and reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in women, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Obesity Prevention in Postpartum Women at High-Risk of Cardiovascular Disease,10040416,K23HL153667,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Censuses', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Diseases', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hypertension', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neighborhoods', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Perinatal', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physical environment', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postpartum Period', 'Postpartum Women', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'gestational weight gain', 'health care service utilization', 'healthy lifestyle', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'novel strategies', 'obesity prevention', 'patient oriented', 'peer support', 'postpartum weight', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial diversity', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention', 'weight loss program']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2020,175248,0.04566745926200143
"Effects of Functional Food Diets on Cardiometabolic and Metabolomics Profiles in Minority Youth PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This proposal outlines a career development plan to help Dr. Jaapna Dhillon complete her postdoctoral training and establish an independent research program focused on personalized dietary interventions to reduce cardiometabolic risk in minority populations. Her training will be conducted in a multidisciplinary group of scientists with research expertise in nutrition science, health disparities, molecular cell biology, metabolomics and computational biology. Her advisory team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow her to fill critical gaps in her toolkit needed to use an integrative and personalized approach to nutrition. This award will enhance her knowledge in developing culturally sensitive nutrition interventions and cardiovascular physiology, and provide advanced training in metabolomics and computational biology. During the training phase of this award, she will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. Rational: The incidence of diet-related cardiometabolic disorders is increasing at an alarming rate in racial/ethnic minority groups such as Asians and Hispanics, and are much higher than Non-Hispanic Whites in the United States. [8]. However, whether improvements in diet quality will influence minority groups at high risk of cardiometabolic diseases differentially than Whites at high risk is not well understood. Functional foods such as nuts, whole grains and vegetables can help ameliorate cardiovascular disease and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, most studies on functional foods and health have been overwhelmingly performed in middle-aged to older non-Hispanic White adults, with young minority populations being greatly neglected. Adapting a functional food diet at earlier life stages may prevent or ameliorate metabolic disorders later in life in minority populations that are at greater risk for developing chronic metabolic diseases. Our central hypothesis is that adapting a personalized functional food diet at earlier life stages will have greater beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid regulation pathways in minority youth at risk for developing cardiometabolic disorders compared to White youth at risk. Design: The mentored phase study will 1) examine the effects of almonds on blood glucose regulation pathways using metabolomics techniques and 2) provide preliminary data for the development and testing of a model that can predict effects of almonds on metabolic consequences in minority youth. The independent phase study will evaluate the long term effects of a personalized diet rich in functional foods on pathways of carbohydrate and lipid regulation in relation to the gut microbiome and cardiovascular outcomes in minority youth at high risk for cardiometabolic disorders. Relevance: The proposed studies will provide an initial evidence base for the health benefits of personalized functional food interventions in minority youth. This innovative dietary strategy may be more effective at reducing risk and ameliorating diet-related cardiometabolic disorders than conventional dietary advice in this population.

"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9897563,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'professional atmosphere', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2020,202864,0.16429922301088185
