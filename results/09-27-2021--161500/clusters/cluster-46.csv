"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures,9819865,K08EB027141,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arterial Injury', 'Award', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Caliber', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Crush Injury', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Extravasation', 'Fall injury', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shorthand', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse outcome', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer infrastructure', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle form', 'neural network architecture', 'outcome prediction', 'pelvis fracture', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'real time model', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K08,2019,186183,0.00358734231124986
"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,9733308,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2019,388750,0.008769978916610823
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9685235,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'random forest', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,586227,0.007661977563789747
"Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Modern digital pathology departments produce a tremendous amount of whole slide image data, which is quickly growing to petabyte scale. This plethora of data presents an unprecedented treasure chest for all kinds of medical machine learning tasks, including improvements in precision medicine.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of digital slides are not annotated on the image level, so histological points of interest are not integrated with the clinical notes or genetics associated with a patient. In contrast to other disciplines, manual labeling is not only cumbersome and time-consuming, but given the decades-long training of a pathologist, it is exorbitantly expensive and, due to clinical time constraints, impractical. Moreover, the time- dependent relationship between a patient's histology and genotype is not quantitatively leveraged to recommend combination therapies. Genetics informs us of important driver mutations, but how multiple cell types interact with these mutants over time in the tumor microenvironment to become histologically evident is less clear.  Deep learning synthesizes generations of pathologist knowledge as accurate quantitative models. Given a picture of a patient's morphology, I provide a tool that in four seconds finds the top ten most similar patients with their diagnoses, to support a pathologist's diagnosis decisions under the time pressures of active surgery. Recording the pathologist inspecting a slide at the microscope automatically annotates observed slide regions with time. Not only amenable for learning models that predict whether or not a region is salient to a pathologist making a diagnosis, this also allows all slides in a hospital to be annotated to identical criteria with only a representative sample of slides. I have submitted a manuscript reporting 85.15% accuracy in this saliency prediction task. This annotation greatly simplifies machine learning tasks, which can now focus on a non-redundant set of diagnostic regions in the slide, whether the application is to (a) find similar patients by morphology for diagnosis or (b) relate diagnostic morphology to the genetics.  Statistically modeling the relationship of the genotype to the histological phenotype in cancer opens promising new avenues in precision medicine. Taking a Big Data approach, I will leverage over 18,244 paired genome-histology samples to learn this model, using transfer learning techniques to maximize the value of all 18,244 samples for each tissue type. Genotype-phenotype model in hand, I will simulate the molecular clock in cancer, incrementally mutating the genome and predicting corresponding histology at each molecular time step. Through similar Q-learning that powers Google's champion artificial intelligence ``AlphaGo'', I will learn an agent that inhibits expression of a small set of mutant genes to maximize cancer progression-free survival time, by molecular time in the simulator. This not only measures the therapy's evolutionary durability, but also leads directly to experimentally testable hypotheses in 3D cell culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Digitized whole slide images of cancer tissue are a ``dark matter'' in the clinic, data that are often collected but rarely used quantitatively to model cancer or personalize medicine. I will, through close collaborations with practicing pathologists at globally leading cancer research hospitals, form statistical models of the histology evident in whole slides to (i) create clinical decision support tools that find similar patients by morphology alone to disambiguate cases that are difficult for a pathologist to diagnose under the time pressures of ongoing surgery, (ii) create a tool that learns which parts of a whole slide image are salient for a pathologist at the microscope to make a diagnosis, which greatly facilitates the deep learning techniques underlying [i] and [iii] by discarding redundant histological image data, and (iii) create a system that relates genotype to histological phenotype in cancer and learns an agent which leverages this system to determine the optimal multistage combination therapy to drive the histology towards health such that cancer progression-free survival time is maximized in the patient of interest. In this way, my statistical models will transform the vast dark matter of diagnosed histology data, representing generations of pathologist knowledge at these leading hospitals, into an indispensable resource for surgery, pathology, genetics, and precision medicine.","Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization.",9637337,F31CA214029,"['Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'CDH1 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Cells', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Drug Combinations', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'FGFR3 gene', 'Farming environment', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Medicine', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Second Opinions', 'Slide', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer imaging', 'cell type', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'improved', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular clock', 'molecular marker', 'mutant', 'overexpression', 'personalized medicine', 'petabyte', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'support tools', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F31,2019,45016,-0.010792569756567241
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages. The application of the methodology developed will be illustrated using data from the NIH dbGAP repository, thereby further promoting the use of open access data sources.

"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9723527,R21EB027865,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral plasticity', 'complex biological systems', 'environmental change', 'evidence base', 'fitness', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'indexing', 'injured', 'injury prevention', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'medical specialties', 'mixed reality', 'multimodal data', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult', 'young man', 'young woman']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2019,326700,0.005074299370584752
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,9687065,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'computerized data processing', 'data modeling', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,448622,-0.013966119025326391
"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its risk factors of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent in the United States. To better understand the mechanism between adiposity-obesity-related CKD mechanism, the proposed research will implement machine learning algorithms, and identify distinct patient subgroups and discover novel CKD biomarkers, using the clinical and high-dimensional metabolomics data from a diverse cohort of CKD patients. The findings of our study hold promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD, and facilitate personalized disease management.",Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease,9834239,F31DK122683,"['Active Learning', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome Assessment', 'PTH gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Troponin T', 'Tryptophan', 'United States', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'patient subsets', 'personalized management', 'population based', 'preservation', 'random forest', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted biomarker', 'tool']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2019,45016,-0.0398816496356719
"Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs Project Abstract for HealthTech Solutions Kidney transplantation is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes. Twenty-two patients die each day waiting for a transplant and 30% of all deaths in the US could be prevented by organ transplant. Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effective advantages of kidney transplantation, there has been a decades-long rise in the kidney discard rate from 5.1% in 1988 to 19.2% in 2015. During a successful Phase I grant and to address the need for a dedicated communications system to help improve transplant patient outcomes and achieve greater donated organ utilization, HealthTech Solutions (HTS), Inc. developed a proprietary mobile application for secure team communication tailored specifically for kidney transplant teams. To further improve communication efficiency and augment critical decision making in healthcare, specifically for surgeons, HTS will employ machine learning (ML) powered clinical decision support. Clinical decision support (CDS) may significantly increase access, increase quality, and reduce the cost of kidney transplantation. The proposed project is designed to further test and quantify the improvement of the donor management, coordination process, and kidney utilization outcomes using the company’s CDS and communication infrastructure for medical team communication. The aims are; 1) Develop CDS models specifically for transplant professionals aimed at improving decision times and decision confidence. Develop the CDS infrastructure capable of handling medical data and serving insights safely, securely, and rapidly; 2) Asses usability by working with a test group to exceed usability criteria and ensure that CDS meets clinician needs through user feedback iterations. Verification of utility from a diversified testing group (n=10) that represent every type of professional involved in transplant cases. 3) Measure the effects of TXP Chat enhanced with CDS after live clinical implementation in the kidney offer and procurement processes for more than 3,000 offers (1,500 with CDS and 1,500 control) over a period of 365 days with multiple partner institutions (n=3). TXP Chat and CDS will demonstrate to be reliable, secure, trustworthy and useful by the clinical/technical community, increase kidney acceptance practices resulting in an increase in kidney transplants, reduction in cold ischemic time, and reduction in time from offer to transplant. Ultimately, these metrics have been demonstrated in the literature to improve patient outcomes, reduce expensive chronic treatment costs (e.g. dialysis), reduce patient deaths from lack of kidney availability, and significantly improve human health and productivity. Study results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aim 1 will lay the foundation for further development to enable wider CDS in the Phase IIB. Aim 2 will prove physician support and steady adoption trend as we roll into commercialization. Aim 3 will provide multi-center pilot study data used to prove increased efficiency of the process in terms of time, money, and total number of kidneys transplanted. Project Narrative Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effectiveness advantages of kidney transplantation for many patients, nearly 1 in 5 kidneys authorized for donation are discarded. This project addresses the need for an efficient communications software technology enhanced with clinical decision support tailored for organ procurement organizations and transplant centers. Combined with enhanced communication efficiency, clinical decision support powered by machine learning may significantly improve donated kidney utilization and increase the number of viable, but currently unused organs that could otherwise be successfully transplanted, reducing waste and saving lives.","Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs",9845904,R44LM012575,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Direct Costs', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Multiple Partners', 'Organ', 'Organ Procurements', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Renal Glycosuria', 'Reporting', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'Treatment Cost', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'burnout', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'cohesion', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'operation', 'prevent', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'transmission process', 'transplant centers', 'trend', 'usability', 'wasting']",NLM,ORGANIZER,R44,2019,512863,0.029802532824400242
"2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE 2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A 1.5-day symposium, StoneLab will be held December 6-7, 2019 at AUA Headquarters in Linthicum, Maryland, near BWI Airport. The novel StoneLab Symposium will be a meeting where kidney stone researchers can come together with experts in biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, medical device design and development. We plan to encourage researchers to “think outside the box” in the search for advances in kidney stone treatment. The target audience for this meeting includes: urologists, nephrologists, basic scientists, early-career investigators, residents, research fellows, and project management members of urology research teams in the area of nephrolithiasis and related technology development. It is essential that the urology community, and especially trainees, early-career physician- scientists, and researchers be provided with accessible opportunities to gain understanding of new knowledge and recent advances in not only their own fields, but in related fields that they may not otherwise be aware of, and leverage this for new research frameworks that can help improve the treatment of kidney stone disease. A critical aspect of the StoneLab Sympoisum is the delivery of talks from outside the normal realm of kidney stone research by leading basic scientists, followed by discussions led by kidney stone researchers and surgeons. The intent of these discussions is to spur the development of collaborations and the generation of new ideas and avenues for exploration. Another goal of the meeting is to help identify future funding needs and growth areas for kidney stone research. The R13 support requested in this application will encourage early investigators to participate in the workshop and stimulate their development as researchers and surgeon- scientists. This symposium will have a major impact by bringing together premier kidney stone researchers, along with experts in nephrology, biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, and medical device design and development, to explore solutions for the most pressing translational science issues facing kidney stone researchers today. The Principal Investigator (PI), Carolyn J.M. Best, PhD, is AUA Director of Research. The Program Planning Committee consists of a diverse multidisciplinary team of distinguished scientists and urologists, most of whom also serve in leadership roles of several AUA-affiliated subspecialty societies: Khurshid Ghani, MD, MS (Chair); Ben H. Chew, MD, MSc (Co-Chair); Thomas Chi, MD; Benjamin Canales, MD, MPH; Gary Curhan, MD, ScD; Amy Krambeck, MD; Dirk Lange, PhD; Manoj Monga, MD, FACS; Kristina Penniston, PhD,RD; and Aria Olumi, MD (ex-officio). 2019 STONE LAB SCIENTIFIC SYMPOSIUM: THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR KIDNEY STONE DISEASE  PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT This application seeks support to enable the American Urological Association (AUA) to invite early-career investigators (and late-stage trainees) to participate in a novel interdisciplinary symposium where premier kidney stone researchers, along with experts in nephrology, can come together with experts in biomedical engineering, physics, chemistry, artificial intelligence, and medical device design and development with the aim of “thinking outside the box” in the search for advances in kidney stone treatment.

"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9695208,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2019,335803,-0.006754053504651251
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning.

"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9818198,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,399485,0.004346682444413537
"Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Critically injured patients have a four-fold higher risk of death from medical errors than other hospitalized patients, with nearly half of preventable deaths related to errors during the initial resuscitation phase. Although protocols, simulation, and leadership training improve team performance in this setting, as many as 12 protocol deviations per resuscitation have been observed, even with experienced teams. Given adverse outcomes that can result from performance gaps, there is a critical need to establish novel approaches for applying real-time decision support in critical-care settings. The long-term goal is to implement decision support for trauma resuscitation and other fast-paced, high-risk critical care settings that improves performance, reduces errors, and prevents adverse outcomes. The overall objective for this renewal is to vertically advance what was achieved during the first funding period by designing, implementing and testing an intention-aware recommender system that (1) recognizes and tracks current goals using sensor data, the output from patient monitors, and data captured from digital devices, (2) derives recommendations that support adherence to goal- based protocols, and (3) displays these recommendations in real time on wall displays. The central hypothesis is that decision support aligning with intentions (“intended” or “current” goals) will enhance protocol compliance, leading to improved outcomes related to trauma resuscitation. The rationale for this renewal is that recommendations supporting protocol compliance that are aligned with team intentions are more likely to be adopted by being less distracting and associated with lower cognitive load. Guided by preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) design and implement an automated real- time approach for predicting and monitoring the assessment and treatment goals of trauma resuscitation; and 2) generate and display a recommended plan of activities that supports current goal pursuit during trauma resuscitation. For the first Aim, machine learning approaches will be applied for recognizing goals using data obtained from sensors and other digital data sources. Under the second Aim, a machine learning strategy will be implemented and tested that generates recommendations responsive to team intentions. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on development of real-time methods that integrate goals as an input for making recommendations that meet the most current and relevant information needs. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve the care of severely injured and other critically ill patients by promoting timely and appropriate achievement of critical assessment and treatment goals in settings that remain at high-risk for medical errors. The results of this research continuum are expected to have an important positive impact on the outcome by addressing the mismatch between complex decision-making and human vulnerability to error that remain in critical care settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is relevant to public health because it focuses on the design and implementation of a novel real-time decision support system that will reduce errors associated with adverse patient outcomes by providing recommendations that support the current information needs of multidisciplinary trauma teams. The proposed project is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission related to development of biomedical communications systems, methods, and technologies, and information dissemination and utilization among health professionals.",Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes,9739552,R01LM011834,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Information Dissemination', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'success']",NLM,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,709825,-0.005610479375460974
"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

"A new approach to predict graft outcome from histology in children undergoing kidney transplantation using machine learning methods Abstract Although the overall renal graft survival has dramatically improved over the last several decades, almost half of pediatric patients lose their transplant within 10 years. Epidemiology, immunology and histology are all key elements in understanding post-transplant complications and in predicting clinical outcomes, however accurate prediction of transplant outcomes remains challenging and understudied among pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Machine learning technology is rapidly advancing and has demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy surpassing classical predictive models in several biomedical applications. The goal of this research proposal is to develop machine learning methods to improve prediction of transplant outcomes through analysis of histology, assemble data sufficient to describe the incidence of different types of rejection and histological findings on pediatric kidney transplant biopsies, and to assess their impact on graft outcome. To achieve these goals, we will assemble an international multicenter cohort of over 700 pediatric kidney transplant recipients and develop and validate machine-learning models combining clinical, immunological and histological data for predicting short-term pediatric graft outcomes. This study will enable accurate, reproducible, and standardized assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and provide a new method to predict graft outcome. This will pave the way to future large, prospective study assessing the feasibility and potential impact of machine-learning methods in transplant biopsy analysis, with the goal of improving clinical management and resource utilization by identifying patients with high risk of graft loss. Finally, this study will provide critical information for efficient and effective design of clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of pediatric kidney transplant recipients, with an emphasis on individualized treatment. Project Narrative: Accurate prediction of graft outcome in pediatric kidney transplant patients is critical to individualize patients' management and treatment and to design efficient and effective clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of these patients. Our long-term goal is to improve the assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and create a new systematic methodology to predict graft outcomes that can be applied nationally and internationally.

"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,9634912,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data Methods', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'convolutional neural network', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neural network', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2019,299899,-0.036640708623114235
"Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches Summary: There is an urgent need for an automated decision support system for diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). TBI is one of the leading causes of death in the modern world, and substantially contributes to disability and impairment. The early detection of TBI and its proper management presents an unfilled need. We therefore aim to supplement clinicians' decisions by developing a decision support system for monitoring and integrating available information of a TBI patient for accurate and quantitative diagnosis and prognosis. This project is the main component of a long-term goal of building a system that creates personalized treatment plans. Specifically, we intend to automatically detect and accurately quantify two critical abnormalities including shift in the brain's middle structure (Aim 1) and intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 2) from computed tomography (CT) head scans. In Aim 1, we develop a model for delineating the spatial shift in brain structure and its predictive power. We employ anatomical landmarks to detect a 3D deformed surface of the brain midline after TBI. Such an approach allows us to quantify the shifted volume, a measurement that is not currently achievable. Additionally, it provides accurate and timely access to conventional midline shift in a 2D CT slice. In Aim 2, we build a model for delineating intracranial hemorrhage and its predictive power. We implement a 3D convolutional neural network model to detect hemorrhagic regions and quantify and localize their volume. Currently, these measurements are inaccurate and not readily available due to the cumbersome manual process; instead a lesion's thickness in a 2D CT slice is used to assess its severity. In both Aim 1 and 2, we automatically calculate conventional and proposed volumetric and locational measurements and compare them to suggest the best diagnostic metric for each abnormality. Finally, in Aim 3, we build an automated pipeline for TBI severity assessment and outcome prediction. To this end, manual CT scan reads will be integrated with patient-level information available from electronic health records to achieve accurate data-driven diagnosis and prognosis. We implement machine learning approaches to build models capable of predicting short and long-term clinical outcomes. Our prediction models will be developed independently of our image processing algorithms. Upon achievement of Aims 1 and 2, automatically calculated information from CT scans will be incorporated into machine learning models. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance TBI care, specifically within the “golden hour"" post-injury. Ultimately, such a system has the potential to reduce delayed and missed diagnosis, thereby reducing TBI morbidity and mortality. Additionally, by preventing permanent and/or secondary injuries, and minimizing the time of hospitalization and rehabilitation, our system will contribute to reducing the annual $76 billion burden of TBI care in the U.S. In addition to innovation in the proposed approaches and their quantitative outputs, we aggregate four existing datasets to incorporate heterogeneity in both phenotypes and therapies, so the resulted model will be generalizable and applicable to real clinical settings. Project Narrative: Traumatic brain injury, frequently referred to as a silent epidemic, involves about 1.7 million people in the U.S, among whom 50,000 will die, while 152,000 will suffer from long-term disability and impairment. The proposed research will automatically diagnose and assess the severity of critical abnormalities from computed tomography head scan, and integrate all available sources of clinical data using data science methods to make a personalized data-driven prognosis. It is expected that this technology will provide caregivers with critical information for early and proper management of injuries, thus saving lives and improving the quality of life of survivors by reducing second/permanent injuries; importantly, this system would enable people living in outlying and deprived regions lacking skilled clinicians benefit from more accurate diagnostics, and as a result, a better care.",Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches,9757500,F31LM012946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tomography, Computed, Scanners', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'functional outcomes', 'human error', 'image processing', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2019,37153,0.005269188579719473
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,9739179,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2019,119704,0.0038539597902712964
"Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population. PROJECT SUMMARY I propose to gain experience in what are becoming the next big topics in genomic medicine – the integration of “big data” using data science in order to achieve “precision health” – what could be summed up as “data science of the future”. These topics emerge from - but go beyond - the narrower concept of “precision medicine” as the use of genetic information for treatment decisions. The goal is to develop experience in data science and precision health so that my work can serve as a bridge between my field of economics and these fields - and begin to prepare for the future challenges as they emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both data science and precision health will be critical components of future health care interventions and impact patients, providers, and society. “Big Data” using data science includes the aggregation and analysis of data across platforms (includes information from, e.g. genetic testing, biosensors, wearables, and electronic health records, with such data analyzed using, e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning). Precision Health uses a “big data” approach to focus on disease prevention and detection throughout one’s lifetime.","Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population.",9929780,U01HG009599,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biosensor', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Patients', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Sum', 'Work', 'data integration', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'formal learning', 'genetic information', 'informal learning', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2019,166973,0.024018113056260344
"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9769180,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,559137,-0.05134838298596642
"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",9681489,K99HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'survivorship', 'tenure track']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2019,108012,-0.008204114003374346
"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,9816658,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,451307,-0.04747776137745463
"Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation Project Summary Candidate Goals and Objectives: With a background in Information Systems and Management, and Biostatistics, Dr. Zhang has demonstrated research records on electronic health record data mining to identify patterns of healthcare delivery that may be used to inform patient-centered and evidence-based healthcare. The proposal will provide additional training for Dr. Zhang on advanced machine learning, statistics, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics for applications on clinical decision support (CDS). Dr. Zhang's long-term goal is to bringing innovation CDS development and evaluation through novel biomedical informatics and data science techniques. Institutional Environment and Career Development: Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) provides ideal research facilities and training environment for Dr. Zhang. Dr. Jyotishman Pathak, Chief of Division of Health Informatics at Department of Health Policy and Research, will lead a multidisciplinary team of mentors: Drs. Jessica Ancker and Fei Wang at WCM, and Dr. Adam Wright at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Zhang also has collaborators in WCM and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who will support her in her training and research activities and provide clinical expertise. Research Aims Order sets are a type of CDS in computerized provider order entry (CPOE) to standardize decision making in the ordering process and encourage compliance with clinical practice guidelines. Previous literature on order set use has focused its effect on usability, workload, and physician satisfaction, but a knowledge gap remains with respect to the effect of order sets on care outcomes. The overall goal of the research study is to create a continuous improvement cycle for order sets with respect to a care outcome by rigorously learning from data. Aim 1 of the study will apply computational phenotyping and subtyping algorithms to identify cohorts of heart failure (HF) subtypes. Aim 2 will evaluate an existing order set intended for the care of HF patients on a care outcome defined as 30-day all-cause, unplanned readmission with a hypothesis that the use of this order set is associated with a better outcome. This will be achieved by building a range of outcome prediction models and evaluating the strength of each order set order as a predictor. Aim 3 will optimize the existing order sets using a metaheuristic optimization method such that its content collectively may have the largest positive effect on the outcome of 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The effects of order set use on the care outcome is measured using a causal inference technique in each iteration. The expected outcome is a framework to develop and evaluate HF order sets which may eventually be generalized to other clinical areas. Training from this proposal may lead to multi-site R01 studies of outcome-driven HF order sets and actual implementations. Project Narrative In this study, we propose a continuous improvement cycle to develop, manage, and evaluate outcome-driven order sets, a type of clinical decision support (CDS) for computerized provider order entry (CPOE). Mentorship and training include advanced statistics, machine learning, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics. The proposed research will leverage the principal investigator (PI)'s background in methodology development and health information systems to provide the PI with additional training to innovate outcome-driven CDS for CPOE.","Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation",9871053,K01LM013257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health Information System', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Management', 'Information Systems', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care outcomes', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'computerized physician order entry', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health care delivery', 'health care service organization', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'long short term memory', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilayer perceptron', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'personalized decision', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'research facility', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'success', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K01,2019,184191,-0.032460208935717355
"EPICA: Edge-based Precision Intensive Care Analytics Abstract Medical decision making in intensive care settings relies on complex biomedical information, collected in real time, to assist hospital staff in patient management and intervention decisions. In this context, machine learning (ML) applications applied to healthcare analytics have been shown to provide significant improvement in quality of care and overall efficiency in ICU operations. A number of challenges affect healthcare analytics, these are growing data sizes, increasingly heterogeneous data sources, data assurance, credibility and quality as well as the privacy of patient record interchange. Current approaches to healthcare analytics are predominantly reliant on desktop and cloud computing architectures. These traditional systems exhibit high-latency, high-power requirements, and are overall inefficient for advanced analytic applications. If we hope to leverage the benefits of growing data size and heterogeneity, a new hardware paradigm for real time, secure and reliable ML in the clinic is needed. A potential for great innovation in medical big data applications is to imbue more analytic capability into smaller devices that sit closer to the source of data. This so-called edge computing will be instrumental in future medical applications, where real-time, low-latency, low-power computational tools are likely to dramatically improve the feasibility of remote monitoring and intensive monitoring applications, ultimately improving health outcomes. Lucid Circuit, Inc. is developing a line of purpose-built edge-analytics processors called AstrumTM. AstrumTM is an energy-efficient runtime-adaptable processor for reliable high-performance computing and low-power applications. AstrumTM processors benefit from an adaptable compute fabric that combines runtime-reconfigurable architecture and in-silicon security features. AstrumTM processors are designed to supports evolving analytics algorithms. In this proposal, we seek to optimize state of the art ML algorithms for signal processing, data quality monitoring and safe data interchange in remote and intensive-monitoring medical applications at the edge using AstrumTM. In phase II, we seek to develop an analytics programming ecosystem within which developers can customize signal quality metrics and prediction rules at a high level of abstraction, using popular analytics programming platforms. Ultimately, the work proposed in this application will enable the development of a new generation of edge-based precision intensive care and mobile health devices, together with a programming toolkit for customization, tuning, and development of ML algorithms that best match the needs of researchers, patients, and healthcare providers. Project Narrative Machine Learning (ML) applications to medical big data, have been shown to provide improved quality of care in intensive care settings. Their implementation in the clinic is currently limited by reliance on obsolete desktop and cloud computing architectures.

"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9916110,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2019,274577,0.0069197462948767385

Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio)statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field of health big data. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offers and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will primarily draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from three different departments within three different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science, Medicine, Population Health, Social and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including statistical modeling, data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high- dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and medical imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and success with the current summer program on Big Data led by this team with 164 students trained in the last 4 years (2015-2018) including 90 female students and 30 students from underrepresented minority groups. Fourteen of these participants from the last three years are currently graduate students in Michigan Biostatistics. The ongoing program has gained traction in the national landscape of summer research programs with 20% rate of admission and 80% rate of acceptance among those who are offered this opportunity. The program has consistently received very strong evaluation and our past alumni have become brand ambassadors and advocates for our program. We plan to build on the success and legacy of this program in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2019-2021). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a non-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 45 undergraduates nationally and internationally, with 20 domestic students supported by the requested SIBS funding mechanism and others supported by supplementary institutional and foundation support. We propose to expose the trainees to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of health Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. They will engage in mentored research projects in three primary areas of health big data: Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. Some of the projects will be defined in the area of cardiovascular precision medicine, defined by a team of highly quantitative researchers engaged in cardiovascular research that uses big data. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by U-M researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. We propose an inter-SIBS collaboration with Dordt College summer program trainees who will attend this concluding symposium. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world. We will offer multiple professional development opportunities and resources for graduate school preparation to our trainees so that they can reflect and plan beyond their senior year. All of our proposed activities are reflected through our three specific aims: Teaching, Mentoring and Dissemination. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a six week long undergraduate summer institute: “Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data” to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 45 undergraduate students recruited nationally and internationally, from 2019-2021. Funding is requested for 20 domestic students with supplementary funding expected to be garnered through institutional resources and private foundation support. The program builds on the success of our existing Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI) supported by a NIH BD2K Courses and Skills grant award that is ending in 2018. We plan to expose program students to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data and Human Health. We enhance our ongoing summer program structure in the current proposal by involving a team of researchers working at the intersection of cardiovascular research and data science with a focus on cardiovascular precision medicine where some of the new mentored research projects will be defined. We primarily focus on three genres of health Big Data arising in Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. The trainees will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty from Biostatistics, Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences, Epidemiology and Medicine, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9782996,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,348107,-0.00312934034702087
"Big Omics Data Engine 2 Supercomputer Computational and data science has transformed biomedical scientific discovery: its approaches are embedded into a wide range of workflows for diseases such as schizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, influenza, autism, drug addiction, pediatric cardiac care, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, prostate cancer and multiple myleloma. Sixty-one basic and translational researchers at Mount Sinai representing over $100 million in NIH funding, along with their collaborators from 75 external institutions, have utilized the Big Omics Data Engine (BODE) supercomputer to elucidate significant scientific findings in over 167 publications, including high impact journals such as Nature and Science, with 2,427 citations in three years. These researchers have also shared the data generated on BODE throughout their consortia and into national data sharing repositories. BODE is nearing the end of its vendor maintainable life, and researchers need increased computational throughput and storage space. To empower researchers to not only continue their inquiries, but to also tackle more complex scientific questions with decreased time to solution, we propose the Big Omics Data Engine 2 Supercomputer (BODE2). BODE2 will contain a total of 3,200 Intel Cascade Lake cores with 15 terabytes of memory and 14 petabytes of raw storage, and will leverage an existing 250 terabytes of SSDs. An instrument of this size is not available elsewhere affordably. With the proposed instrument, researchers will be able to take advantage of three major benefits: (1) the ability to receive results faster for overall greater scientific throughput; (2) the ability to increase the fidelity of their simulations and analyses; and (3) the ability to migrate research applications seamlessly to the software environment for greater scientific productivity. As with data produced on BODE, BODE2 data products will also be shared with the broader scientific community. BODE2 will provide the critical infrastructure needed by the wide range of researchers and clinicians for the genetics and population analysis, gene expression, machine learning and structural and chemical biology approaches used to make advances in these diseases. A specialized Big Omics Data Engine 2 Supercomputer instrument will provide necessary computational and data science infrastructure for 61 research projects with 75 collaborating institutions in diverse areas such as Alzheimer's, autism, schizophrenia, drug addiction, influenza, pediatric cardiac care, depression, epilepsy, prostate cancer and multiple myeloma.

"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,9788528,R21MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,207338,-0.0028249697282688993
"Big Data, Big Models, and Big Bias?: A decision making framework for vital rate estimates based on extrapolation Project Summary/Abstract The past decades have seen a flurry of methods that use extrapolation, smoothing, and other forms of information sharing to compensate for limited and incomplete data. In places without comprehensive vital registration or public health monitoring systems, extrapolation and information sharing techniques are particularly appealing, since there typically is simply not enough data available to produce estimates with sufficient temporal or spatial resolution to influence public health decision making. This proposal reframes uncertainty in extrapolated estimates of vital rates in terms of decision-making. A decision-making framework (i) is grounded in familiar language for policymakers and public health officials, (ii)characterizes consequential and inconsequential model decisions based on variability in outcomes, and (iii) in- corporates both extrapolation and sampling uncertainty. A cornerstone of this project is a novel collaboration with researchers and policymakers at the World Bank. Through this collaboration, we will pilot the proposed decision-making tools and conduct experiments with local and national policymakers in realistic settings. Project Narrative Predictions based on machine learning models are increasingly common inputs into decision making processes across scientific domains. In this proposal I develop and evaluate strategies for making public health decisions based on predicted vital rates, particularly in places without full coverage civil registration. Results from the project will improve strategies for allocating resources for disease surveillance and health monitoring in scarce resource settings.","Big Data, Big Models, and Big Bias?: A decision making framework for vital rate estimates based on extrapolation",9780910,DP2MH122405,"['Big Data', 'Collaborations', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Health', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'World Bank', 'base', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'novel', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP2,2019,2332500,0.015402740925991587
"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization.

"QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a combination of innovative statistical and data visualization approaches using patient-generated health data, including mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable devices and smartphones, and patient-reported outcomes, to improve outcomes for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). This research will offer new insights into how to process and transform patient-generated health data into precise lifestyle recommendations to help achieve remission of symptoms. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To develop new preprocessing methods for publicly available, heterogeneous, time-varied mHealth data to develop a high quality mHealth dataset; 2) To develop and apply novel machine learning methods to obtain accurate predictions and formal statistical inference for the influence of lifestyle features on disease activity in IBDs; and 3) To design and develop innovative, interactive data visualization tools for knowledge discovery. The methods developed in the areas of preprocessing of mHealth data, calibration for mHealth devices, machine learning, and interactive data visualization will be broadly applicable to other mHealth data, chronic conditions beyond IBDs, and other fields in which the data streams are highly variable, intermittent, and periodic. This work is highly relevant to the mission of the NIH BD2K initiative which supports the development of innovative and transformative approaches and tools to accelerate the integration of Big Data and data science into biomedical research. This project will also enhance training in the development and use of methods for biomedical Big Data science and mentor the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists. The proposed research is relevant to public health by seeking to improve symptoms for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, which are chronic, life-long conditions with waxing and waning symptoms.

"A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data Project Summary:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure affecting 10% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States. In-hospital mortality of 35-46% has been reported across the spectrum of mild-severe ARDS, and one third of patients with initially mild ARDS will progress to moderate or severe ARDS. Over the last 20 years, multiple studies have reported improved outcomes for ARDS patients using specific ARDS targeted therapies. However, ARDS remains persistently under-recognized and challenging to diagnose. Only one third of ICU providers correctly identify ARDS on the first day when diagnostic criteria are met, and less than two thirds ever recognize the diagnosis in the ICU. This under recognition of ARDS may prevent some patients from receiving lifesaving therapies necessary for treating the disease. Attempts to automate ARDS diagnosis using rule- based algorithms have seen limited success, and require analysis of subjective data from patient histories, like chest scans, which limit diagnosis automation, timeliness, and study reproducibility.  To improve the current state of the art of ARDS detection technology, we intend to utilize objective and readily available data including both ventilator waveform data, (VWD) and electronic health record (EMR) data to 1) improve the recognition of ARDS, and 2) identify high-risk ARDS patients most likely to benefit from additional ARDS treatments. For this task, we will make use of an existing dataset of VWD from over 500 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, including 156 patients with confirmed ARDS. Our preliminary analyses using a machine learned model and a subset of lung physiology features derived solely from VWD, suggest that ARDS can be diagnosed in the absence of a chest scan or medical history. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will improve our existing model used for discriminating ARDS by adding objective EMR data, and additional features extracted from VWD, such as patient respiratory compliance and airway resistance. Our next focus will be to predict worsening of ARDS severity in intubated patients based on Berlin criteria. So in Aim 2, we will evaluate the best tools for predicting increases in ARDS severity, and which types of temporal information yield the best predictive results.  We hypothesize that model development using additional objective data derived from VWD analysis and the EMR, along with advanced analytic techniques, will further improve ARDS diagnosis, and enable the prediction of clinical trajectories in patients with ARDS. The proposed work will yield innovative clinical decision support models that can be used to improve the state of the art in automated ARDS diagnosis. Our predictive modeling will also enable greater insight into the times when physicians can perform clinical interventions to arrest ARDS induced physiologic deterioration. Ultimately, these innovations could save lives by quickly detecting ARDS, and alerting physicians to begin or intensify ARDS focused therapies based on patient pathophysiologic state.

"Statistical Methods for Ultrahigh-dimensional Biomedical Data This proposal develops novel statistics and machine learning methods for distributed analysis of big data in biomedical studies and precision medicine and for selecting a small group of molecules that are associated with biological and clinical outcomes from high-throughput data such as microarray, proteomic, and next generation sequence from biomedical research, especially for autism studies and Alzheimer’s disease research. It focuses on developing efficient distributed statistical methods for Big Data computing, storage, and communication, and for solving distributed health data collected at different locations that are hard to aggregate in meta-analysis due to privacy and ownership concerns. It develops both computationally and statistically efficient methods and valid statistical tools for exploring heterogeneity of big data in precision medicine, for studying associations of genomics and genetic information with clinical and biological outcomes, and for feature selection and model building in presence of errors-in- variables, endogeneity, and heavy-tail error distributions, and for predicting clinical outcomes and understanding molecular mechanisms. It introduces more robust and powerful statistical tests for selection of significant genes, SNPs, and proteins in presence of dependence of data, valid control of false discovery rate for dependent test statistics, and evaluation of treatment effects on a group of molecules. The strength and weakness of each proposed method will be critically analyzed via theoretical investigations and simulation studies. Related software will be developed for free dissemination. Data sets from ongoing autism research, Alzheimer’s disease, and other biomedical studies will be analyzed by using the newly developed methods and the results will be further biologically confirmed and investigated.

"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9613818,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,188952,0.01291440236613993
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9685036,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2019,50016,0.0039401292950753475
"Measuring post-arrest neurologic injury via nanofluidic assay of brain-derived exosomal RNA Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) strikes over 300,000 people in the US annually. Between 30-50% of OHCA survivors experience some degree of long-term neurologic injury, from mild cognitive defects to severe disability. These injuries are the result of a complex set of ischemia-reperfusion phenomena, known as the post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), that occurs over the first few days after resuscitation. Prognostication during this critical period, and prediction of neurologic disability, remains an enormous challenge. Serologic markers of brain injury, such as nerve-specific enolase or S100-B, have been tested extensively but have limited predictive value. Quantifying PCAS injury during clinical care has remained a key knowledge gap; with more accurate injury measurement, clinicians would be better able to tailor patient care appropriately by adjusting the intensity of brain-protective therapies including targeted temperature management. Our team has developed a novel approach to injury assessment that applies nanofluidic technology to isolate and analyze brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from serum, small circulating bodies that represent their cells of origin and are released into the blood in greater quantity when cells are damaged or die. Exosomes carry a collection of microRNA (miRNA) species that can be measured and sequenced, allowing for precise analysis of a “transcriptome of brain injury”. When we coupled brain-derived exosomal miRNA analysis with machine learning techniques, we demonstrated that exosomal measurement predicted injury severity after traumatic brain injury. We now seek to apply this technology to post-arrest neurologic assessment; we hypothesize that serial EV sampling will allow for more precise measurement of PCAS-related brain injury. We will perform serial blood sampling of adult (age>17 y) non-traumatic resuscitated OHCA patients (0,6,12,24 h post-arrest) as well as from a negative control set of patients with myocardial infarction and positive control set of patients with significant cerebrovascular accident. We will characterize brain-derived miRNA species from both cohorts, first in a “derivation group” (n=10) and then a “validation group” (n=40) for each cohort. We will collect demographic and clinical outcome data, including neurologic status at discharge and at 90 d via modified Rankin Scale (mRS), dichotomized into “good” (mRS 0-2) or “poor” (mRS 3-6) outcome. A machine learning algorithm will be applied to the derivation group to develop an injury predictive tool, which will then be tested in the validation group. We hypothesize that (1) EV-derived miRNA will identify OHCA patients with brain injury at discharge compared to negative controls and (2) miRNA analysis will discriminate between OHCA patients with good or bad outcomes. Finally, we will apply the predictive tool across 4 timepoints in the OHCA cohort, hypothesizing that more injured patients will show a more significant injury miRNA pattern among earlier timepoints. If successful, this strategy could be coupled to post-arrest trials that require real-time neurologic injury evaluation, and could enable clinicians to tailor care to improve long-term neurologic outcomes. NARRATIVE Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest afflicts >300,000 people in the U.S. each year. Many resuscitated victims die before hospital discharge or suffer enduring neurologic disabilities from ischemia-reperfusion injury, yet our ability to quantitatively measure these injuries during critical care are limited. We propose to test a novel diagnostic approach to address this, using nanofluidic technology to isolate and characterize brain-derived microRNAs from a cohort of initial survivors of cardiac arrest, compared to a control cohort of patients with myocardial infarction (negative control) and a cohort of patients with stroke (positive control).",Measuring post-arrest neurologic injury via nanofluidic assay of brain-derived exosomal RNA,9824489,R21NS109763,"['Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'CD81 gene', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'GLAST Protein', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurological status', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resuscitation', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'enolase', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microvesicles', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanofluidic', 'nanoscale', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'serological marker', 'species difference', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,442750,0.0019137684461583977
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies.

"Application of Data Sciences in Traumatic Brain Injury ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and patients with moderate-severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Patients with TBI who have surgery have poor outcomes, attributed to a high (>50%) prevalence of perioperative second insults such as hypotension and hypocarbia, which reduce cerebral perfusion and cause cerebral ischemia. Anesthesiologists provide analgesia, sedation, immobility, and amnesia, and aim to confer physiological stability, expected patient response, real-time physiological data, and professional judgement but are unfortunately unable to accurately predict in real time which patients with TBI will have hypotension and hypocarbia. Yet, avoidance of these second insults increases discharge survival among patients with TBI. Predicting and preventing hypotension and hypocarbia during TBI care is, therefore, vital, and avoidance of hypotension and hypocarbia are key performance indicators for perioperative TBI care. Small data science studies suggest that machine learning (ML) techniques can model and predict TBI pathophysiology and help reduce unwanted second insults after TBI. The project goal is to use ML methods to prevent second insults (hypotension and hypocarbia) during urgent/emergent perioperative TBI care. In response to PA-16-161, we propose 2 Specific Aims: 1) To construct and identify the TBI physiological ML model that most accurately predicts perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia, and 2) To develop ML derived personalized prescriptions for prevention of perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia. This project is innovative and will be impactful because the approach is grounded in strong data science, and acute care, and implementation science frameworks, because it develops ML derived prescriptions to prevent hypotension and hypocarbia, and because we use ML solutions to improve care quality and outcomes after TBI. NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, and patients with moderate- severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Anesthesia care for TBI is high risk and associated with low blood pressure and hypocarbia which can cause cerebral ischemia.

"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden.

"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias. Results from this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations.",Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae,9720953,R01MH110453,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Attention', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Etiology', 'Explosion', 'Family', 'Fire - disasters', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poisoning', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'member', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'protective factors', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'time use', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,325818,-0.0015280512850420886
"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,9871037,K23NS114201,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master of Science', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological Models', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'active comparator', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disorder subtype', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'stroke patient', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2019,200880,-0.06469316682986141
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9606512,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2019,570175,-0.007461391800865657
"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,9767837,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories', 'violence exposure']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2019,138258,-0.003237075603278287
"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",9791705,P01DK043881,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2019,1619137,-0.017727680826534007
"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibody mediated rejection is a major cause of kidney transplant failure. The pathophysiology of antibody mediated rejection is poorly understood and current treatment strategies frequently fail.

"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,9789266,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,621247,0.0036344148429550043
"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9685220,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,166704,-0.011029847515186661
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9783829,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2019,202477,-0.002096742102713094
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9652672,K01HL136687,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'respiratory health', 'risk prediction model']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2019,172087,0.025326369734037735
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9738159,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,763789,-0.011774065357855978

"Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by pancreatic beta destruction with subsequent insulin depletion. The alterations in glucose dynamics are incredibly difficult to manage and are confounded by meals, exercise, menstruation, and stress. Although automated insulin delivery systems are becoming commercially available, the large majority of people with T1D are treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). Dangerous complications of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis can occur from failure to dose insulin correctly, however vigilant adherence to tedious insulin dosing strategies are difficult for MDI users maintain. This difficulty is magnified during exercise, which is critical to ameliorating long-term complications of diabetes; even when guidelines for insulin dosage adjustments are followed, acute hypoglycemia during exercise and night-time hypoglycemia can occur. In our recent survey of 1400 subjects living with T1D, the majority of subjects on MDI therapy were not confident in managing their glucose during exercise and felt they lacked tools to do so. In aggregate, difficult treatment schedules and bolus calculations, associated acute complications from daily activities, and the emotional and psychological toll of this chronic disease can result in treatment non-adherence and poor glycemic outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for decision support tools designed for MDI users to improve glycemic control surrounding meals, daily activities and exercise. The goal of this proposal to develop a decision support tool for patients with type 1 diabetes who utilize continuous glucose monitoring systems and multiple daily injection therapy. This tool will be called miTREAT, the multiple injection treatment recommender system for exercise-aware therapies. We hypothesize that use of a novel decision support tool equipped with content-based collaborative filtering methods and dynamic exercise hypoglycemia prediction algorithms will improve overall euglycemia and reduce time spent in hypoglycemia for patients on MDI therapy. In our first aim, we will leverage decades of research in computer science recommender systems and machine learning optimization strategies to develop a novel decision support system that identifies issues in glycemic control and recommends appropriate insulin dose and behavioral modifications. In our second aim, we will develop a new exercise model that reflects both the dynamics of rapid-uptake of glucose through GLUT-4 channels and the longitudinal biphasic insulin sensitivity profile. This new model structure will be used to predict hypoglycemia during and after the exercise period. In our third aim, we will explore the performance of our decision support engine in an in-vivo clinical trial. This clinical trial will assess the usability of a new smart-phone app designed to assist MDI users that we have developed at OHSU. In achieving these goals, we will develop the first decision support system that provides treatment and behavioral recommendations to patients on CGM-augmented MDI therapy. This system will improve overall time in euglycemia, and reduce the occurrence of acute complications surrounding exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 Diabetes is difficult to manage through multiple daily injections, and there is a paucity of tools available to assist patients with treatment decisions. In this proposal, the fields of computer science, machine learning, constrained optimization and clinical science are united to develop a novel decision support tool for multiple daily injection users. This is accomplished in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,9758549,F31DK121436,"['Acute', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Assimilations', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical Technology', 'Menstruation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Running', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Study Subject', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'computer science', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'dosage', 'e-commerce', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'glucose disposal', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insulin sensitivity', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,50016,-0.003773519014394021
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9733206,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2019,194368,0.003948021771442194
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9613245,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,352125,0.040682559766377774
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9747350,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'platelet function', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,199098,0.0005640122044605493
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,9781491,R01HL140362,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Height', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intensive Care Units', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nurses', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'community setting', 'computer science', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'learning strategy', 'lung injury', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'research data dissemination', 'respiratory', 'response', 'theories']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2019,747700,0.018316096647745108
"The CRIT-ICU Biomarker Panel for Stratification of Mortality Risk in ARDS Patients PROJECT SUMMARY: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that annually afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. Substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity within ARDS phenotypes has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to reduce mortality. All therapies currently employed in ARDS management are ge- neric. The critical care community suffers from a lack of tools that allow identification of ARDS sub-phenotypes and individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. Recently, the hyperinflammatory and low inflammatory ARDS sub-phenotypes were identified that markedly differ in natural histories, clinical and biological character- istics, biomarker profiles, responses to positive end-expiratory pressure, ventilator- and organ failure-free days and mortality. ARDS severity (PaO2/FiO2 ratio), the severity of renal or hepatic failure, or the extent of leukocy- tosis failed to distinguish the two phenotypes. As the mortality of the hyperinflammatory phenotype is 3-5 times greater than low inflammatory phenotype, this Phase I STTR will leverage substantial complementary expertise to: i) establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that stratifies subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes; and ii) develop a quantitative platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon patient entry into the ER or ICU. Our preliminary biomarker data are strong and include 11 ARDS-relevant plasma biomarkers in >250 well-phenotyped ARDS subjects and 70 controls. The targeted biomarkers include cytokine-chemokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1b, IL-RA), dual-functioning cytozymes i.e. cy- tokine/intracellular enzymes (macrophage migration inhibitory factor, NAMPT), vascular injury markers (VEGF- A, S1PR3, angiopoietin 2), and the advanced glycosylation end product pathway (HMGB1, soluble RAGE). Spe- cific Aim #1 will apply standard biostatistical approaches as well as novel neural network artificial intelligence analysis of this existing dataset to identify an optimal plasma-derived CRIT-ICU Panel which predicts ICU mor- tality in patients with sepsis or trauma who are at risk for development of respiratory failure and ARDS. Specific Aim #2 will develop an optimized and highly standardized Predictive Platform for the CRIT-ICU biomarkers iden- tified to be used in the clinical care setting. Finally, Specific Aim #3 will conduct retrospective validation studies of the optimized CRIT-ICU Panel in biobanked samples from 2 large cohorts: an emergency room-ARDS cohort (PETAL Clinical Network, n=800) and a Spanish sepsis-ARDS cohort (n=200). We speculate that unique exper- tise within Aqualung Therapeutics Corp., PAI Life Sciences Inc., InBios International Inc. and the University of Arizona Health Sciences will drive future prospective validation of the CRIT-ICU Panel in patients at risk for ARDS (Phase II STTR) and lead to development of a true Point of Care test to accelerate clinical trial stratification strategies, and development of innovative ARDS therapeutics to reduce mortality in this devastating syndrome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastatingly intense lung inflammatory disorder that afflicts more than 1 million individuals world-wide each year (200,000 cases/year in the U.S.) with an unacceptable mortality rate of 30-40%. The tremendous heterogeneity of ARDS has greatly impeded therapeutic developments to address ARDS mortality and all therapies currently employed in ARDS management are generic. The critical care community suffers from a lack of empirical data and tools that would allow identification of ARDS sub- phenotypes and potentially identify individuals most likely to benefit from novel therapies. This Phase I STTR leverages substantial complementary expertise to establish a novel panel of ARDS biomarkers (CRIT-ICU Panel) that will be used to stratify subjects at risk for ARDS into high and low mortality sub-phenotypes and develop a predictive platform to allow assessment of these validated biomarkers upon entry into the ER or ICU.

"TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS PROJECT SUMMARY With an associated mortality of 35%, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) contributes to the morbidity and mortality seen in many acute conditions such as pneumonia, influenza, sepsis, trauma and aspiration. Yet studies consistently show that ARDS is under-recognized in up to 40% of patients with generally low and variable adoption of practices shown to improve mortality in ARDS. The overall goal of this proposed project is to improve care delivered to ARDS patients by promoting accurate identification of patients with ARDS and increasing adoption of evidence-based interventions shown to improve outcomes in ARDS. With the recent publication of a multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS, this proposal specifically aims: 1) To increase identification of ARDS patients with an automated electronic tool (ARDS Sniffer 2.0) powered by the predictive analytics of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. 2) To translate the recently published multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS into an evidence-based, context-appropriate, Electronic Clinical decision support system in ARDS (ECARDS) for the management of ARDS. This process will be informed by an expert panel from the CPG committee as well as a semi-qualitative analysis of the cognitive decision making process, data needs and workflow of users in a series of Think-Aloud studies and focus group interviews. ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ECARDS and an ARDS Dashboard to show near real-time data on the incidence of ARDS and rate of utilization of best care will then be incorporated within the hospital EMR for useability testing with another series of Think-Aloud and semi-qualitative studies. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ARDS Dashboard, and ECARDS in a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized control trial of 3 hospitals within the Montefiore Healthcare System to increase utilization of recommended interventions in ARDS and improve outcomes. 4) To promote the dissemination of the clinical decision support system through our partner professional organizations of American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and American Association of Respiratory Care and Program for Emergency Preparedness. Because of the high pressure, high acuity, and rapidly changing status of the acutely ill ARDS patient, clinical decision making often defaults to the automated, pattern-driven cognitive processes which are particularly prone to unconscious biases and errors and cognitive overload from large volumes of shifting data. As such, this proposal is the ideal research demonstration project to develop a new clinical decision support tool that will harness the power of big data and predictive analytics to identify ARDS in the hospital and deliver an evidenced-based, expert and user informed clinical decision support tool to clinicians at the right point during their clinical interaction and workflow with these patients in order to promote the right interventions to the right patients at the right time. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome constitutes the most severe form of respiratory failure in the hospital with an associated mortality of 35%, it is consistently under-recognized and proven treatments are underutilized. This proposal aims to harness the power of big data in the hospital information system to identify patients with ARDS and prompt clinicians with the evidence-based best management of this condition. By developing a computerized decision support system whose design is informed by the experts and the clinicians themselves, this proposal aims to bring the right care to the right patient at the right time to save lives and promote recovery from this devastating condition.",TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS,9763432,R18HS026188,[' '],AHRQ,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R18,2019,397898,0.030889403939112485
"Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction to the exposure to severe psychological stress, including trauma re-experiencing, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. Our group has conducted seminal work to establish PTSD as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and autonomic dysfunction. A major concern, based on these findings, is that PTSD could increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) through autonomic dysregulation. This has important clinical implications on management of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. Two important metrics that are potentially useful for risk stratification are T-wave alternans (TWA) and Morphological Beat Variability (MVB). We have found in preliminary investigations that TWA may be linked to acute stress and PTSD, but additional study is needed. In this R03 application, we seek to collaborate with Dr. Gari Clifford in Biomedical Informatics to create a custom program that measures TWA and MVB with state-of- the-art signal processing in a recently recruited cohort of male veteran twins with high-resolution ECG data. We will also study for genetic influences with twin modeling and the effects of acute stress with laboratory- based trauma reminder challenges. Our aims are to 1) Examine the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA a) over 24 hours, and b) during trauma recall challenge; 2) Evaluate the potential role for familial and genetic factors by comparing the within-pair difference in MVB and TWA between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD. We hypothesize that MVB and TWA will be higher, on average, during a 24 hour period, and will increase during trauma recall challenge in PTSD subjects compared to those without PTSD. In addition, we hypothesize that the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA will be stronger within DZ pairs than MZ pairs, implying that there is a common genetic pathway linking PTSD and SCD risk. The development of methods to measure these factors, as well as the study of these important mechanisms, will accelerate Dr. Shah’s progress towards research independence, and help to establish him as an expert in the field of mental stress and SCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Posttraumatic stress disorder is a common and debilitating psychiatric condition that is associated with increased heart disease risk. Whether or not this means that it increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia is not known, but important for clinical management. To study this, we aim to examine the risk of PTSD and its symptoms on electrocardiographic markers of sudden cardiac death.",Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study,9723857,R03HL146879,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Arrhythmia', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional Stress', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Veterans', 'Viola', 'Visit', 'War', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'heart disease risk', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'method development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'programs', 'recruit', 'signal processing', 'sudden cardiac death', 'traumatic event', 'vector']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2019,78000,-0.019982848532925427
"Role of the Snail1-Twist-p21 axis on cell cycle arrest and renal fibrosis development Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) such as kidney fibrosis are global health challenges. In the US alone CKD cost Medicare an estimated 50 billion dollars for patients with CKD age 65 and older in 2013. Recent studies revealed that after AKI renal epithelial cells undergo a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) and G2/M cell cycle arrest through a Snail1-Twist1-p21 axis; these cells secrete profibrotic factors and contribute to fibrosis progression. Therefore these three factors become promising potential drug targets for treating fibrosis, but further development requires addressing several outstanding open questions. The temporal sequence and causal relation between pEMT and cell cycle arrest is controversial, and the respective roles of Snail1, Twist1, and p21 on regulating pEMT and cell cycle arrest is unclear. Addressing these questions requires quantitative systems biology approaches beyond cell biology methods traditionally used in the field. In recent years my lab has made progression on deep learning based image automated analysis for live cell images, CRISPR-based gene editing, and mathematical modeling and other quantitative biology tools. These technological developments position us to tackle the above-mentioned challenging questions related to kidney fibrosis. Based on existing studies and our preliminary results, we hypothesize that there is a temporal order of the three factors, with p21 initializing G2/M arrest, which is reinforced by subsequent upregulation of Snail1; Snail1 also activates, and Twist1 further maintains the pEMT program; due to their temporally varying roles, effectiveness of targeting these factors depends on the timing of treatment. We will test the hypothesis with quantitative imaging studies using established cell lines and primary renal epithelial cells and mathematical analysis of competing models. In Aim 1, we will perform multi-color flow cytometry studies and time-lapse imaging studies on progression of cell cycle, EMT, and other cell fates of cells under stimulation. The two types of studies will provide complementary information on whether pEMT and cell cycle are tightly coupled, and will map out the temporal sequence of events of various cell fate change as well as correlation to expression levels of the three factors. In Aim 2, we will monitor the temporal profiles of these factors through fluorescence protein tagging in single cells, and use the data to evaluate an ensemble of models to identify one or a set of minimal network regulating EMT and G2/M arrest. We will then further examine the roles of individual factors through model analysis and a series of inhibition experiments. Success of the proposed research will provide mechanistic understanding of the regulatory network of cell cycle arrest and EMT in renal epithelial cells. The proposed research is our starting point for an emerging field of quantitative systems biology on kidney fibrosis. We expect that introducing quantitative approaches will greatly accelerate future development of treatment strategies on the increasing global health challenge imposed by progression of fibrosis, which currently lacks effective treatment. Kidney fibrosis is global health challenge with no effective treatment currently. Our proposed research will examine how two fibrosis contributing processes, cell cycle arrest and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, are coupled. The research will lay foundation for developing novel dynamic strategies to treat kidney fibrosis through rescuing cells from cell cycle arrest.",Role of the Snail1-Twist-p21 axis on cell cycle arrest and renal fibrosis development,9638719,R01DK119232,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Color', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibrosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'G2/M Arrest', 'Genes', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Label', 'M cell', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tubular formation', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial to mesenchymal transition', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging study', 'kidney epithelial cell', 'kidney fibrosis', 'live cell imaging', 'loss of function', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2019,341955,0.016608051453488957
"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),9675348,UG3NS106899,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Drug Targeting', 'FAIR principles', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'bench to bedside', 'biobehavior', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'productivity loss', 'repository', 'response to injury', 'spinal cord and brain injury', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UG3,2019,240508,-0.0026713825497205078
"Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers PROJECT SUMMARY As a computational biologist, my long-term goal is to develop methods and tools to discover new or better therapeutics for cancers. In the past few years, I have identified drug-repositioning candidates for a number of primary cancers using Big Data approaches. These candidates have been validated successfully in preclinical mouse models. To maximize the utility of Big Data, I plan to translate the findings into therapeutics; therefore, I propose to develop methods to utilize transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers. Current preclinical and clinical approaches including the NCI MATCH trial select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations, yet patients may have no actionable mutations or multiple actionable mutations that are hard to prioritize, suggesting the need for other different types of molecular biomarkers. The recent efforts have enabled the large-scale identification of various types of molecular biomarkers through correlating drug sensitivity with molecular profiles of pre-treatment cancer cell lines. Computational methods to match these biomarkers to individual patients to inform therapy in the clinic are thus in high demand. The objective of this award is therefore to develop computational approaches to identify therapeutics for individual patients by leveraging large-scale biomarkers identified from cancer cell lines. Through conducing this research, I expect to expand my knowledge in cancer clinical trials, cancer genomics, cancer biology, and statistics. To achieve the goal, I have gathered seven renowned experts from different fields related to Big Data Science as mentors/advisors/collaborators: Primary Mentor Dr. Atul Butte in translational bioinformatics from UCSF, Co-mentor Dr. Samuel So in cancer biology from Stanford University, Co-mentor Dr. Mark Segal in statistics from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Andrei Goga in cancer biology from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Laura Esserman in breast cancer trials from UCSF, Collaborator Dr. John Gordan in liver cancer trials from UCSF and Collaborator Dr. Xin Chen in cancer biology from UCSF. With the support from my world- class mentors, advisors and collaborators, this award will prepare me to be a leader in developing big data methods that are broadly impactful. PROJECT NARRATIVE One goal of the precision medicine initiative is to select optimal therapies for individual cancer patients based on their molecular and clinical profiles. Current preclinical and clinical approaches select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations. This work is expected to employ the protein/gene expression based biomarkers computed from public databases to inform individualized cancer therapy.","Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers",9741127,K01ES028047,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Award', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Non-Malignant', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'data sharing', 'drug candidate', 'drug efficacy', 'drug sensitivity', 'efficacy testing', 'genetic signature', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'protein expression', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,170187,-0.03235079440162732
"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,9672412,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'kidney biopsy', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2019,169110,0.011519641326074373
"A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias BCR-ABL1 positive leukemias account for a substantial portion of adult leukemia. Tyrosine kinase  inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically changed survival outlook. However, current protocols recommend  patients receive TKI chemotherapy agents indefinitely, causing long-term toxicity and substantive  quality of life deficits, leading to decreased TKI compliance. Moreover, >50% of patients who stop  TKIs ultimately relapse and are not as responsive to post-relapse treatment; additionally, mutation  resistance is becoming an increasing issue with TKIs as patients live longer. It is hypothesized  patient heterogeneity within BCR-ABL1 leukemias are a major driving factor on outcome and strongly  influences optimal TKI selection and cessation. However, small cohort size and disease rarity has  impacted large, pragmatic clinical trials, necessitating a big data approach. The overall goal is  to quilt together individual studies to produce a comprehensive view of BCR-ABL1 leukemias that  includes epidemiology, etiology, assessment, and therapy, as well their inter-relationships. With  a comprehensive view, personalized, predictive medicine becomes possible. This project utilizes  literature mining and “big data” techniques to analyze four major categories: epidemiology (who  gets BCR-ABL1 leukemias, how response correlates to patient characteristics, etc.); etiology (what  factors trigger mutation, mechanisms to improve TKI specificity, preclinical model metrics,  prognostic indicators of recurrence/relapse, etc.); assessment (identifying new  diagnostic/prognostic metrics, improving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols, objective  staging criteria); and treatment (aggregate effect sizes among different therapies, short and  long-term side effect profiles, TKI selection protocols, adjunctive and combination therapies,  criteria for TKI cessation, etc.). The specific aims of the project include: 1) prototype a data  path and construct infrastructure for BCR-ABL1 data curation from literature and/or clinical  sources; 2) construct literature ontological field map to quantify topic depth, aggregate data, and  identify relationships within and between categories; 3) perform exploratory analysis to assess  aggregate statistical power and prototype predictive models for TKI optimization. In summary, the  present project delivers a 21st century, big data approach for BCR-ABL1 leukemia to optimize  clinical management and expedite basic preclinical research. This project is highly relevant to public health as it enables a comprehensive view of BCR ABL  positive leukemia(s) that can optimize clinical management and expedite preclinical research.",A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias,9728205,R21CA232249,"['ABL1 gene', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dimensions', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sample Size', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'Universities', 'Wheelchairs', 'adult leukemia', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'compliance behavior', 'data mining', 'database schema', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'drug intolerance', 'drug intolerant', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'lexical', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'rare cancer', 'relational database', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'side effect', 'text searching', 'treatment duration']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,167262,-0.003093359592556546
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9785527,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2019,192917,-0.010290692873497063
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered  collaborative decision making and using big data to accurately predict and quantify wound healing outcomes.           ",Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research

"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9703894,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2019,642740,0.014777501721100903
"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9649217,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organizational Models', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Violence', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'automated reasoning', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2019,116529,0.01944132164662546

"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns. Fully automatic kidney ultrasound image segmentation and quantification methods will be developed using deep convolutional neural networks for early predicting chronic kidney disease progression",Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children,9669438,R21DK117297,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'End stage renal failure', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Bone Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Urinary tract', 'Urodynamics', 'age group', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'boys', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'kidney preservation', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized predictions', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'secondary analysis']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,262171,-0.016020601923483813
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9784742,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data pipeline', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2019,533529,0.01828911238562244
"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials.

"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9747912,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2019,168896,0.009697334459711389
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,9782929,K01DK110136,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2019,154915,0.006288594393864587
"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,9573854,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2018,388750,0.008769978916610823
"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving but is limited by a shortage of organ donors and an unacceptably high donor organ discard rate. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on manual quantitation of key microscopic findings by pathologists. A major limitation of this microscopic examination is human variability and inefficiency in interpreting the findings, resulting in potentially healthy organs being deemed unsuitable for transplantation or potentially damaged organs being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model capable of automatically quantifying percent global glomerulosclerosis in whole slide images of donor kidney frozen section wedge biopsies. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, diminished health care costs, and improved patient outcomes. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated quantitative evaluation as the standard practice of donor kidney evaluation prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert kidney pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the computerized approach to quantifying percent global glomerulosclerosis and compare these results with current standard of care pathologist evaluation. The feasibility of deploying the Deep Learning model to analyze whole slide images on the cloud will also be examined. The end product of this STTR will be a web-based platform to securely deploy Deep Learning image analysis as a tool to assist pathologists with donor kidney biopsy evaluation. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Before a kidney can be transplanted, the tissue must be assessed under a microscope to ensure the organ is healthy enough for transplant. A major limitation of microscopic examination is human variability in interpreting the findings, resulting in healthy organs being deemed unsuitable for transplantation. This funding will support developing computer algorithms to assist pathologists in microscopic examination of donor kidney tissues, resulting in more consistent and objective biopsy interpretations, minimizing discard of potentially usable kidneys and optimizing organ placement for transplant.",A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies,9678574,R41DK120253,"['Address', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data Set', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Freezing', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Organ Donor', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Speed', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'computerized', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'meetings', 'power analysis', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NIDDK,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R41,2018,214009,-0.0011165566156395997
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Modern digital pathology departments produce a tremendous amount of whole slide image data, which is quickly growing to petabyte scale. This plethora of data presents an unprecedented treasure chest for all kinds of medical machine learning tasks, including improvements in precision medicine.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of digital slides are not annotated on the image level, so histological points of interest are not integrated with the clinical notes or genetics associated with a patient. In contrast to other disciplines, manual labeling is not only cumbersome and time-consuming, but given the decades-long training of a pathologist, it is exorbitantly expensive and, due to clinical time constraints, impractical. Moreover, the time- dependent relationship between a patient's histology and genotype is not quantitatively leveraged to recommend combination therapies. Genetics informs us of important driver mutations, but how multiple cell types interact with these mutants over time in the tumor microenvironment to become histologically evident is less clear.  Deep learning synthesizes generations of pathologist knowledge as accurate quantitative models. Given a picture of a patient's morphology, I provide a tool that in four seconds finds the top ten most similar patients with their diagnoses, to support a pathologist's diagnosis decisions under the time pressures of active surgery. Recording the pathologist inspecting a slide at the microscope automatically annotates observed slide regions with time. Not only amenable for learning models that predict whether or not a region is salient to a pathologist making a diagnosis, this also allows all slides in a hospital to be annotated to identical criteria with only a representative sample of slides. I have submitted a manuscript reporting 85.15% accuracy in this saliency pre- diction task. This annotation greatly simplifies machine learning tasks, which can now focus on a non-redundant set of diagnostic regions in the slide, whether the application is to (a) find similar patients by morphology for diagnosis or (b) relate diagnostic morphology to the genetics.  Statistically modeling the relationship of the genotype to the histological phenotype in cancer opens promising new avenues in precision medicine. Taking a Big Data approach, I will leverage over 18,244 paired genome-histology samples to learn this model, using transfer learning techniques to maximize the value of all 18,244 samples for each tissue type. Genotype-phenotype model in hand, I will simulate the molecular clock in cancer, incrementally mutating the genome and predicting corresponding histology at each molecular time step. Through similar Q-learning that powers Google's champion artificial intelligence ``AlphaGo'', I will learn an agent that inhibits expression of a small set of mutant genes to maximize cancer progression-free survival time, by molecular time in the simulator. This not only measures the therapy's evolutionary durability, but also leads directly to experimentally testable hypotheses in 3D cell culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Digitized whole slide images of cancer tissue are a ``dark matter'' in the clinic, data that are often collected but rarely used quantitatively to model cancer or personalize medicine. I will, through close collaborations with practicing pathologists at globally leading cancer research hospitals, form statistical models of the histology evident in whole slides to (i) create clinical decision support tools that find similar patients by morphology alone to disambiguate cases that are difficult for a pathologist to diagnose under the time pressures of ongoing surgery, (ii) create a tool that learns which parts of a whole slide image are salient for a pathologist at the microscope to make a diagnosis, which greatly facilitates the deep learning techniques underlying [i] and [iii] by discarding redundant histological image data, and (iii) create a system that relates genotype to histological phenotype in cancer and learns an agent which leverages this system to determine the optimal multistage combination therapy to drive the histology towards health such that cancer progression-free survival time is maximized in the patient of interest. In this way, my statistical models will transform the vast dark matter of diagnosed histology data, representing generations of pathologist knowledge at these leading hospitals, into an indispensable resource for surgery, pathology, genetics, and precision medicine.","Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization.",9416817,F31CA214029,"['Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'CDH1 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Cells', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Drug Combinations', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'FGFR3 gene', 'Farming environment', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Medicine', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Second Opinions', 'Slide', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer imaging', 'cell type', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'improved', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mutant', 'overexpression', 'personalized medicine', 'petabyte', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'support tools', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F31,2018,44524,-0.010792569756567241
"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages. The application of the methodology developed will be illustrated using data from the NIH dbGAP repository, thereby further promoting the use of open access data sources. Optimal risk models are essential to realize the promise of precision medicine. This project develops novel machine learning methods for time-to-event and continuous longitudinal data to enhance risk model performance by exploiting correlations between large numbers of predictors and genetic data.

"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9459930,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cardiovascular insufficiency', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual response', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2018,601883,0.007661977563789747
"Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project we propose to develop Previse, a novel, software-based clinical decision support (CDS) system for predicting acute kidney injury (AKI), and attributing AKI to one of several causal mechanisms (etiologies). Previse will use machine learning methods and information drawn from the electronic health record (EHR) to identify the early signs of acute kidney injury. By doing so before the clinical syndrome of AKI is fully developed, Previse will give clinicians the time to intervene with the goals of preventing further kidney damage, and decreasing the sequelae of AKI. Combining this prediction module with a second module that suggests the underlying causes responsible for an incipient or full AKI, Previse will enable clinicians to make earlier and better-informed treatment decisions for AKI patients. Research Question: Can a machine- learning-based CDS predict the development and progression of AKI in hospitalized patients 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3, with performance providing an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of at least 0.85? Is it possible to use a Bayesian model to infer the cause of AKI with high accuracy (AUROC ≥ 0.75)? Prior work: We have developed a prototype version of the Previse system which predicts AKI up to 72 hours in advance of KDIGO stage 2 or 3 criteria, with an AUROC near 0.70. We have previously developed machine-learning-based predictive tools for sepsis, in-hospital mortality, and other adverse patient events with performance significantly improved over commonly used rules-based scoring systems. Specific Aims: To predict the onset of chart-abstracted KDIGO stage 2 or 3 AKI in retrospective data, 72 hours in advance (Aim 1); to use data drawn from the EHR to identify the cause of AKI at time of onset with high accuracy, and to present this causal inference, its likelihood, and relevant evidence supporting it in a human-interpretable fashion (Aim 2). Methods: We will predict the onset of AKI using a deep, recurrent neural network (RNN). This expressive, nonlinear classifier will incorporate time-series information in the qualitative portions of the EHR and will also incorporate features derived from text components, such as radiology reports. Labeling AUROC of 0.85 or higher at 72 hours pre-KDIGO AKI will constitute success in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we will train a dynamic Bayesian network to identify the cause of AKI. We will train this system using semi-supervised methods, where the causes of a set of AKI examples will be hand-annotated by clinician experts; these examples will be split into two groups, with some used for training and the remainder for testing. Aim 2 will be successful if this training results in etiology identification accuracy of at least 0.75 in the test set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the combined Previse system will be deployed for prospective studies at partner hospitals. Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects approximately 7% of all hospitalized patients each year in the United States, causing short-term and lasting harm, including increased risk of mortality. However, the existing tools for acute kidney injury detection have failed to offer significant anticipation of full-blown AKI, or to provide the insight into the AKI’s root cause, which are needed to make an impact on patient outcomes. We will develop Previse, a machine-learning-based prediction system that continuously monitors for incipient AKI and offers clinicians probable root causes of AKI.","Early Identification of Acute Kidney Injury Using Deep Recurrent Neural Nets, Presented with Probable Etiology",9621546,R43AA027674,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Head Start Program', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Plant Roots', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'computer based statistical methods', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool', 'trend']",NIAAA,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,349320,0.002477321905621367
"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,9486120,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,321839,-0.036640708623114235
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,9582115,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2018,120139,0.0038539597902712964
"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",9505095,K99HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'survivorship', 'tenure track']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K99,2018,105743,-0.008204114003374346
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9418599,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2018,336980,-0.006754053504651251
"Adapting the Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack to Genomics and Health Project Summary We propose building a computational platform based on the high performance Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack (BDAS) to support a new ecosystem of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) applications. This platform will make it faster, easier, and less expensive to develop molecular Clinical Decision Support Systems. These systems require real-time queries of globally distributed data, efficient machine learning on large genomic datasets, and must be secure, fault-tolerant and scalable. BDAS and associated technologies are designed to help us meet these challenges and are therefore ideal building blocks to help us create our computational platform. To encourage the adoption of standards for the querying and sharing of large genomic datasets, we will adapt the BDAS stack to support the standards of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). Project Narrative Funding this work will help establish a production quality FOSS implementation of the important Global Alliance for Genomics and Health standards. Without such open-source implementations, a fragmented and proprietary platform ecosystem would slow down innovation as well as divert resources away from the practice of medicine.",Adapting the Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack to Genomics and Health,9566212,R44GM119858,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Apache', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contractor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Distributed Systems', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Ingestion', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Leadership', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Molecular', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cloud platform', 'cluster computing', 'commercialization', 'design', 'distributed data', 'genomic data', 'health care delivery', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'open source', 'operation', 'petabyte', 'precision medicine', 'symposium', 'web services', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,"CUROVERSE INNOVATIONS, INC.",R44,2018,1069680,0.024871750055462792
"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9574149,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,579883,-0.05134838298596642
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9640372,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347584,-0.00312934034702087
"Statistical Methods for Ultrahigh-dimensional Biomedical Data This proposal develops novel statistics and machine learning methods for distributed analysis of big data in biomedical studies and precision medicine and for selecting a small group of molecules that are associated with biological and clinical outcomes from high-throughput data such as microarray, proteomic, and next generation sequence from biomedical research, especially for autism studies and Alzheimer’s disease research. It focuses on developing efficient distributed statistical methods for Big Data computing, storage, and communication, and for solving distributed health data collected at different locations that are hard to aggregate in meta-analysis due to privacy and ownership concerns. It develops both computationally and statistically efficient methods and valid statistical tools for exploring heterogeneity of big data in precision medicine, for studying associations of genomics and genetic information with clinical and biological outcomes, and for feature selection and model building in presence of errors-in- variables, endogeneity, and heavy-tail error distributions, and for predicting clinical outcomes and understanding molecular mechanisms. It introduces more robust and powerful statistical tests for selection of significant genes, SNPs, and proteins in presence of dependence of data, valid control of false discovery rate for dependent test statistics, and evaluation of treatment effects on a group of molecules. The strength and weakness of each proposed method will be critically analyzed via theoretical investigations and simulation studies. Related software will be developed for free dissemination. Data sets from ongoing autism research, Alzheimer’s disease, and other biomedical studies will be analyzed by using the newly developed methods and the results will be further biologically confirmed and investigated. The research findings will have strong impact on statistical analysis of high throughput big data for biomedical research and on understanding heterogeneity for precision medicine and molecular mechanisms of autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases. This proposal develops novel statistical machine learning methods and bioinformatic tools for finding genes, proteins, and SNPs that are associated with clinical outcomes and discovering heterogeneity for precision medicine.

"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization.

"QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a combination of innovative statistical and data visualization approaches using patient-generated health data, including mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable devices and smartphones, and patient-reported outcomes, to improve outcomes for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). This research will offer new insights into how to process and transform patient-generated health data into precise lifestyle recommendations to help achieve remission of symptoms. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To develop new preprocessing methods for publicly available, heterogeneous, time-varied mHealth data to develop a high quality mHealth dataset; 2) To develop and apply novel machine learning methods to obtain accurate predictions and formal statistical inference for the influence of lifestyle features on disease activity in IBDs; and 3) To design and develop innovative, interactive data visualization tools for knowledge discovery. The methods developed in the areas of preprocessing of mHealth data, calibration for mHealth devices, machine learning, and interactive data visualization will be broadly applicable to other mHealth data, chronic conditions beyond IBDs, and other fields in which the data streams are highly variable, intermittent, and periodic. This work is highly relevant to the mission of the NIH BD2K initiative which supports the development of innovative and transformative approaches and tools to accelerate the integration of Big Data and data science into biomedical research.

"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,9630167,R21MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,206809,-0.0028249697282688993
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9463552,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,694555,-0.001876433843743926
"Application of Data Sciences in Traumatic Brain Injury ABSTRACT Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and patients with moderate-severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care. Patients with TBI who have surgery have poor outcomes, attributed to a high (>50%) prevalence of perioperative second insults such as hypotension and hypocarbia, which reduce cerebral perfusion and cause cerebral ischemia. Anesthesiologists provide analgesia, sedation, immobility, and amnesia, and aim to confer physiological stability, expected patient response, real-time physiological data, and professional judgement but are unfortunately unable to accurately predict in real time which patients with TBI will have hypotension and hypocarbia. Yet, avoidance of these second insults increases discharge survival among patients with TBI. Predicting and preventing hypotension and hypocarbia during TBI care is, therefore, vital, and avoidance of hypotension and hypocarbia are key performance indicators for perioperative TBI care. Small data science studies suggest that machine learning (ML) techniques can model and predict TBI pathophysiology and help reduce unwanted second insults after TBI. The project goal is to use ML methods to prevent second insults (hypotension and hypocarbia) during urgent/emergent perioperative TBI care. In response to PA-16-161, we propose 2 Specific Aims: 1) To construct and identify the TBI physiological ML model that most accurately predicts perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia, and 2) To develop ML derived personalized prescriptions for prevention of perioperative hypotension and hypocarbia. This project is innovative and will be impactful because the approach is grounded in strong data science, and acute care, and implementation science frameworks, because it develops ML derived prescriptions to prevent hypotension and hypocarbia, and because we use ML solutions to improve care quality and outcomes after TBI. NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, and patients with moderate- severe traumatic brain TBI often require urgent/emergent surgical and anesthesia care.

"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9503781,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2018,675630,0.0010073585939949987
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network II ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to certain immunosuppressive medications, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of over 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage novel analysis tools to analyze the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify subgroups of patients with shared expression profiles. And, to combine this data with clinical characteristics and kidney biopsy pathology features to predict response to immunosuppressive therapy. It will utilize advanced analysis techniques which are ideal for rare disease when traditional statistical methods are not well equipped to identify relevant predictors from the large number of potential parameters across the genotype-phenotype continuum. The aims are: Aim 1: To utilize consensus non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on glomerular and tubular genome wide mRNA expression data to identify functional subclasses of NEPTUNE participants. Aim 2: To utilize machine learning algorithms to identify predictors of response to initial immunosuppressive therapy from clinical characteristics, kidney biopsy pathology features and gene expression clusters. The objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by identifying novel, biologically-relevant predictors of treatment response. Risk stratification is useful not only to inform patients and clinicians who are making treatment decisions, but also allows stratification of patients at high risk of treatment failure into clinical trials of novel agents. LAY NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the significant toxicity from the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use clinical characteristics, gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue and pathology features from the kidney biopsy to quantify the likelihood that an individual person will fail to respond to immunosuppressive medications. This approach, if validated, may help to inform patients and clinicians about the risk of treatment failure.",Nephrotic Syndrome Rare Disease Clinical Research Network II,9716867,U54DK083912,"['Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease remission', 'Edema', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Gene Expression', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individual response', 'mRNA Expression', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U54,2018,71580,0.01869128808272606
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond.

"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9428444,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'molecular imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,188952,0.01291440236613993
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9470490,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2018,554686,-0.007461391800865657
"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9468973,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2018,34421,0.0039401292950753475

"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9393346,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency research', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinical implementation', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2018,163944,-0.018165017216047963
"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,9569278,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories', 'violence exposure']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2018,139005,-0.003237075603278287
"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,9691740,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,591323,0.0036344148429550043
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9774474,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biomarker development', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2018,200616,-0.002096742102713094
"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9505590,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,163291,-0.011029847515186661
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9461433,K01HL136687,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'design', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'respiratory health']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2018,172087,0.025326369734037735
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9513528,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2018,194368,0.003948021771442194
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads.

"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9536120,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2018,198669,0.0005640122044605493
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,9594103,R01HL140362,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Environment', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Height', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intensive Care Units', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nurses', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'community setting', 'computer science', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'learning strategy', 'lung injury', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'research data dissemination', 'respiratory', 'response', 'theories']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2018,793267,0.018316096647745108
"TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS PROJECT SUMMARY With an associated mortality of 35%, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) contributes to the morbidity and mortality seen in many acute conditions such as pneumonia, influenza, sepsis, trauma and aspiration. Yet studies consistently show that ARDS is under-recognized in up to 40% of patients with generally low and variable adoption of practices shown to improve mortality in ARDS. The overall goal of this proposed project is to improve care delivered to ARDS patients by promoting accurate identification of patients with ARDS and increasing adoption of evidence-based interventions shown to improve outcomes in ARDS. With the recent publication of a multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS, this proposal specifically aims: 1) To increase identification of ARDS patients with an automated electronic tool (ARDS Sniffer 2.0) powered by the predictive analytics of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. 2) To translate the recently published multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS into an evidence-based, context-appropriate, Electronic Clinical decision support system in ARDS (ECARDS) for the management of ARDS. This process will be informed by an expert panel from the CPG committee as well as a semi-qualitative analysis of the cognitive decision making process, data needs and workflow of users in a series of Think-Aloud studies and focus group interviews. ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ECARDS and an ARDS Dashboard to show near real-time data on the incidence of ARDS and rate of utilization of best care will then be incorporated within the hospital EMR for useability testing with another series of Think-Aloud and semi-qualitative studies. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ARDS Dashboard, and ECARDS in a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized control trial of 3 hospitals within the Montefiore Healthcare System to increase utilization of recommended interventions in ARDS and improve outcomes. 4) To promote the dissemination of the clinical decision support system through our partner professional organizations of American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and American Association of Respiratory Care and Program for Emergency Preparedness. Because of the high pressure, high acuity, and rapidly changing status of the acutely ill ARDS patient, clinical decision making often defaults to the automated, pattern-driven cognitive processes which are particularly prone to unconscious biases and errors and cognitive overload from large volumes of shifting data. As such, this proposal is the ideal research demonstration project to develop a new clinical decision support tool that will harness the power of big data and predictive analytics to identify ARDS in the hospital and deliver an evidenced-based, expert and user informed clinical decision support tool to clinicians at the right point during their clinical interaction and workflow with these patients in order to promote the right interventions to the right patients at the right time. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome constitutes the most severe form of respiratory failure in the hospital with an associated mortality of 35%, it is consistently under-recognized and proven treatments are underutilized. This proposal aims to harness the power of big data in the hospital information system to identify patients with ARDS and prompt clinicians with the evidence-based best management of this condition. By developing a computerized decision support system whose design is informed by the experts and the clinicians themselves, this proposal aims to bring the right care to the right patient at the right time to save lives and promote recovery from this devastating condition.",TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS,9571335,R18HS026188,[' '],AHRQ,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R18,2018,397326,0.030889403939112485
"A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients Abstract Septic shock is a severe condition resulting in a critical reduction of organ perfusion with consequential and common stage 2 and 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in as many as 60% of patients and with an alarmingly high in-hospital co-morbid mortality rate of up to 70%. Current Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend early aggressive fluid resuscitation targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP≥ 65 mmHg); however aggressive resuscitation commonly results in hypervolemia. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), which occurs frequently in critically ill patients, is recognized as a vital parameter reflecting venous outflow that has wide-ranging physiologic effects including an association with AKI. Thus, abdominal perfusion pressure (APP=MAP-IAP) may provide the optimal target to guide hemodynamic support as it reflects both inflow (MAP) and outflow (IAP) perfusion. However, current methods of IAP measurement limit the validation of APP as a hemodynamic target as they are prone to (1) human error, limiting the reproducibility of measurements and (2) contamination resulting in catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Potrero Medical, Inc. has developed the Accuryn Monitoring System, which accurately, automatically and digitally extracts physiological data in real-time from the bladder, without the need for external equipment or manual manipulation. Accuryn received formal 510(k) clearance from the FDA for measurement of IAP, urine output and core temperature in April of 2016. In combination with MAP acquired through standard of care, Accuryn will enable APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation in septic shock patients. In this grant, the use of Accuryn to improve clinical outcomes in septic shock patients via both IAP monitoring and APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation will be validated. We plan to conduct a 24-month clinical trial with 200 septic shock patients divided among three groups: (1) Monitoring (normal IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), (2) Standard of Care MAP group (elevated IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), and (3) APP group (elevated IAP receiving APP≥ 60 mmHg targeted resuscitation. The primary endpoint for comparison will be incidence or progression (defined by peak severity in creatinine and UO compared to baseline levels) of stage 2 and 3 AKI. Secondary endpoints include ICU- and hospital mortality, frequency and duration of RRT, urinary biomarker data, days on mechanical ventilation, mean duration of vasopressor support, and adverse events. Independent comparisons between these groups will (1) verify that elevated IAP during fluid resuscitation is correlated with AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of stage 2 and 3 AKI in septic shock patients compared to MAP-guided resuscitation. With this clinical study, we will validate the need for the Accuryn device to continuously measure IAP and target APP during resuscitation. The data collected from this grant will enable the design of a pivotal phase III clinical study defining APP- targeted hemodynamic support as the new standard of care for septic shock. Narrative Improving the resuscitation procedures in septic shock by (1) better gauging the patient’s volume status and (2) guiding hemodynamic support to individualized patient needs by a balanced, precision approach involving vasopressor support and targeted fluid expansion, may dramatically improve clinical outcomes including acute kidney injury. Potrero Medical intends use our Accuryn Monitoring System, to continuously measure intra- abdominal pressure (IAP) and apply the measure to target abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) during resuscitation to (1) verify the importance of IAP in the development of AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of AKI in septic shock patients compared to current standard care.",A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients,9554957,R44GM123799,"['Abdomen', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Volume', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consequentialism', 'Creatinine', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Equation', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Fluid overload', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Joints', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Venous', 'Work', 'abdominal pressure', 'catheter associated UTI', 'design', 'digital', 'hemodynamics', 'human error', 'improved', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'pressure', 'primary endpoint', 'prospective', 'secondary endpoint', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'urinary']",NIGMS,"POTRERO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2018,1224065,-0.0016609868209461912
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder(MDD), bipolar disorders(BD) and schizophrenia(SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason lies in that most neuroimaging “prediction” studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple “correlation” relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, or lack of multi-site validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with references, and sparse regression etc. can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, which can be promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers, which goes beyond a more descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain diseases. We will develop 3 novel data- driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment(in SZ) or epigenetic factors (miR-132 dysregulation in MDD) may affect covarying brain function and structure, which uses different clinical measures as reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction model that is able to identify imaging biomarkers for precise, individualized prediction of clinical outcomes, e.g., remission status of MDD patients after Electroconvulsive Treatment(ECT). 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep neural networks(DNN) combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), to classify multiple group of psychiatric disorders by using functional connectivity measures, and to trace back the most predictive functional networks from the black box of deep learning by LRP. All above proposed methods will be applied to the big data containing multimodal imaging and behavioral information(n=5000) pooled from existing studies, to investigate biomarkers that can help solve specific clinical difficulties. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, lead to earlier and more effective interventions, suggesting a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep neural networks, supervised learning and dynamic functional information, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, thus identify replicable and precise biomarkers that are able to predict individual clinical measures and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting a large imaging and behavioral dataset (n~5000) to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9733448,R56MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'CREB1 gene', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized predictions', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response']",NIMH,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R56,2018,453304,-0.0013038239974607678
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9535990,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2018,169112,0.009697334459711389
"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),9547665,UG3NS106899,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Drug Targeting', 'FAIR principles', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'bench to bedside', 'biobehavior', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'innovation', 'insight', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'productivity loss', 'repository', 'response to injury', 'spinal cord and brain injury', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UG3,2018,239813,-0.0026713825497205078
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9542295,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'social', 'social model', 'societal costs', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'visiting scholar', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2018,955747,-0.0041757189184140325
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers PROJECT SUMMARY As a computational biologist, my long-term goal is to develop methods and tools to discover new or better therapeutics for cancers. In the past few years, I have identified drug-repositioning candidates for a number of primary cancers using Big Data approaches. These candidates have been validated successfully in preclinical mouse models. To maximize the utility of Big Data, I plan to translate the findings into therapeutics; therefore, I propose to develop methods to utilize transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers. Current preclinical and clinical approaches including the NCI MATCH trial select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations, yet patients may have no actionable mutations or multiple actionable mutations that are hard to prioritize, suggesting the need for other different types of molecular biomarkers. The recent efforts have enabled the large-scale identification of various types of molecular biomarkers through correlating drug sensitivity with molecular profiles of pre-treatment cancer cell lines. Computational methods to match these biomarkers to individual patients to inform therapy in the clinic are thus in high demand. The objective of this award is therefore to develop computational approaches to identify therapeutics for individual patients by leveraging large-scale biomarkers identified from cancer cell lines. Through conducing this research, I expect to expand my knowledge in cancer clinical trials, cancer genomics, cancer biology, and statistics. To achieve the goal, I have gathered seven renowned experts from different fields related to Big Data Science as mentors/advisors/collaborators: Primary Mentor Dr. Atul Butte in translational bioinformatics from UCSF, Co-mentor Dr. Samuel So in cancer biology from Stanford University, Co-mentor Dr. Mark Segal in statistics from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Andrei Goga in cancer biology from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Laura Esserman in breast cancer trials from UCSF, Collaborator Dr. John Gordan in liver cancer trials from UCSF and Collaborator Dr. Xin Chen in cancer biology from UCSF. With the support from my world- class mentors, advisors and collaborators, this award will prepare me to be a leader in developing big data methods that are broadly impactful. PROJECT NARRATIVE One goal of the precision medicine initiative is to select optimal therapies for individual cancer patients based on their molecular and clinical profiles. Current preclinical and clinical approaches select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations. This work is expected to employ the protein/gene expression based biomarkers computed from public databases to inform individualized cancer therapy.","Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers",9675371,K01ES028047,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Award', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Non-Malignant', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'data sharing', 'drug candidate', 'drug efficacy', 'drug sensitivity', 'efficacy testing', 'genetic signature', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'protein expression', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,171217,-0.03235079440162732
"Big data in acute renal rejection PROJECT SUMMARY  Background: Acute rejection of renal transplant, i.e., the immunological response of the human body to a foreign kidney, is the main cause of dysfunction in renal transplant patients, surpassing acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and immune drug toxicity. Over 650,000 patients in the US have end-stage renal disease and renal transplant offers the best outcome for these patients. However, 15%-27% of renal transplant patients have ARTR within 5 years, which if not detected and treated promptly, causes renal damage and leads to renal failure of the transplanted kidney. Currently, ARTR is initially evaluated using blood tests and urine sampling, e.g., plasma creatinine and creatinine clearance. However, these indices have low sensitivity, since a significant change in creatinine levels is only detectable after the loss of 60% of renal function. ARTR diagnosis requires renal biopsy (gold standard), which is invasive, takes a week for diagnosis, and costs up to $20,000. Further, needle biopsy is prone to over- or under-estimation of inflammation. The proposed study seeks to develop and validate a new noninvasive computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) software system that can provide highly accurate (over 97% accuracy) diagnosis of ARTR at an early stage by integrating laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., creatinine clearance (CrCl) and serum plasma creatinine (SPCr)) with imaging-markers that will be extracted from either dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) or diffusion- weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI).  Objective/Hypotheses: The primary objective of this proposal is to develop and validate a clinically usable system for the early detection of acute renal transplant rejection (ARTR) based on testing the following three hypotheses: (i) The perfusion of the contrast agent in the cortex of the rejected kidney is slower than the perfusion of the contrast agent in the non-rejected kidney; (ii) The estimated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the cortex of the rejected kidney is smaller than the estimated ADC in the cortex of the non-rejected kidney; and (iii) Fusing laboratory-based biomarkers (e.g., CrCl and SPCr) with imaging-markers that will lead to novel fused indices for distinguishing rejected versus non-rejected kidneys in clinical decision-making.  Specific Aims: (i) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological perfusion parameters from DCE-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; (ii) Develop a software CAD system for early detection of acute renal transplant rejection based on integrating/fusing the estimated physiological diffusion parameters from DW-MRI data with laboratory-based biomarkers for both rejected and non-rejected transplanted kidneys; and (iii) Evaluate the accuracy of the proposed image analysis software system with clinical data that will be collected at University of Louisville (Approved IRB # 16.0041), University of Michigan (Approved IRB # HUM00115031), and the collected MRI data at The Kidney transplant center at Mansoura University with local regulatory approval.  Study Design: We will develop the following image analysis techniques to accurately analyze both DCE- MRI and DW-MRI: (i) segmentation of the kidney object from the surrounding abdominal structures for either DCE-MRI or DW-MRI using appearance and prior shape models; (ii) a Laplace-based non-rigid registration approach to handle local deformations in the kidney region caused by physiological effects (e.g., intrinsic pulsatile effects, breathing, or transmitted effects from adjacent structures, such as the bowel) during the data collection; (iii) segmentation of the kidney cortex and generation of either the physiological perfusion parameters (e.g., wash-in slope, wash-out slope, time-to-peak, and peak value) or physiological diffusion parameters (e.g., ADC); (iv) classification of the acute rejection versus non-rejection kidney status and evaluating the method as a diagnostic test; and (v) depiction of parametric maps of the estimated perfusion or diffusion indices to help clinical visual assessment of the transplanted kidney. The MRI and clinical data will be obtained from patients who have undergone kidney transplantation from live donors, and are available to our research team via Dr. Beache and Dr. Dwyer (Radiology Department and The Kidney Transplant Center at the University of Louisville, respectively) and Dr. Samaniego-Picota (Director of the Kidney Transplant Program and the Transplant Ambulatory Care Unit at the University of Michigan). In addition to the data that will be collected at the University of Louisville and the University of Michigan, our group has access to MRI data that had been collected from an additional 100 subjects at Mansoura University Hospital, Egypt. This data is available to our group through Dr. Abou El-Ghar, one of the PI collaborators, and it will be used to test the proposed CAD system on the data collected from another geographical area. Our preliminary diagnostic results, based on analysis of DCE-MRI data from 54 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out approach were 98% accurate (sensitivity = 100.00%, specificity = 96%, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 98%). Moreover, our preliminary results, based on the analysis of DW-MRI data from 75 independent in-vivo cases using leave-one-subject-out were 97% accurate (sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 96%, and DSC = 98%). These results demonstrate the potential of the proposed CAD system to complement current technologies such as nuclear imaging and ultrasonography to determine the type of kidney dysfunction post transplantation.

"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,9431752,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2018,170193,0.011519641326074373
"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing integrated EMR early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early with the intent to ultimately refie the process of care for this group to minimize complication development.",Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data,9530647,K01ES026834,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood coagulation', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deltastab', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'career', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'injured', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'smartphone Application', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2018,221740,0.04926899550355001
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9666625,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2018,194005,-0.010290692873497063
"Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research Unit SUMMARY   Approximately  25%  of  diabetic  patients  experience  diabetic  foot  ulcers  (DFUs).  This  is  a  significant  clinical  problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently  been  FDA-­approved  and  no  therapies  that  are  widely  effective  in  treatment.  The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  2014  with  the  sole  purpose  of  facilitating  clinical  trials,  conducting  translational  research  and  providing  care  for  patients  with  chronic  wounds.  Stanford  AWCC  receives  patients  from the University Healthcare Alliance, which spans 60 clinics and 2.5 million people in the San Francisco Bay  Area.  Despite  being  in  a  relatively  prosperous  area,  Stanford  AWCC  treats  patients  from  diverse  socio-­ demographics. In the past two years, Stanford has treated 6000 patients with wounds, of whom 705 had DFUs.  50%  of  the  patients  enroll  in  clinical  trials  and  there  is  a  very  low  dropout  rate  (less  than  5%).  Under  Dr.  Geoffrey  Gurtner’s  leadership,  the  Stanford  AWCC  has  conducted  over  25  clinical  trials,  where  we  have  measured biomarkers and tested novel therapeutic interventions (Aim 1).     It is known that wound healing trials experience a significantly higher failure rate in Phase III studies compared  to  any  other  drug  trial.  This  is  primarily  due  to  the  poorly  controlled  procedural  component  of  wound  care.  At  Stanford,  we  address  these  issues  by  (i)  practicing  a  multi-­disciplinary  approach  overseen  by  physicians,  (ii)  standardizing  the  measuring  and  reporting  of  healing  outcomes,  (iii)  emphasizing  rigorous  and  efficient  operational  processes  during  clinical  trial  conduct  and  (iv)  collaborating  with  other  major  academic  centers  (Aim  2).  Looking  forward,  it  is  critical  to  optimize  patient  engagement  during  their  treatment  regimens  and  inculcate  a  shared  decision-­making  process.  Clinical  studies  in  medical  fields  such  as  cancer  have  indicated  that  such  patient-­centered  approaches  lead  to  the  adherence  of  treatment  regimens  and  clinical  trials.  This  is  currently  lacking  in  with  patients  with  DFUs.  With  Dr.  Arden  Morris’s  expertise,  the  Stanford  AWCC  practices  new approaches that centers around the patient, with a focus on improvement in their quality of life (Aim 3).     Dr.  Nigam  Shah,  the  Director  of  Bioinformatics  at  Spectrum,  Stanford’s  Clinical  and  Translational  Sciences  Award  has  worked  with  the  Stanford  AWCC  and  developed  computational  tools  that  predict  wound  healing  outcomes. These models have been developed using data from the Healogics database, the country’s largest  network  of  wound  care  clinics  and  a  Stanford  AWCC  operational  partner.  Dr.  Shah  also  has  expertise  in  analyzing electronic health records of patients from large databases such as TRUVEN and OPTUM, which will  allow  for  the  determination  of  unique  biomarkers  for  wound  healing  through  computational  modeling.  These  models can be executed across the entire Diabetic Foot Consortium (Aim 4).    Narrative    The  Stanford  Advanced  Wound  Care  Center  (AWCC)  was  opened  in  October  2014  to  fill  both  a  clinical  and  academic  need  by  integrating  clinical  trials  and  research  in  wound  care.  Since  its  launch,  the  number  of  patients  with  DFUs  at  Stanford  AWCC  has  doubled  in  each  of  the  past  two  years  and  the  unit  has  been  financially  successful,  ensuring  its  long-­term  viability.  Here,  we  demonstrate  the  ability  of  Stanford  AWCC  to  serve  as  a  Clinical  Research  Unit  (CRU)  by  displaying  access  to  patients  with  DFUs  from  a  wide  sociodemographic, emphasizing quality of clinical research conducted, demonstrating ways of patient-­centered  collaborative decision making and using big data to accurately predict and quantify wound healing outcomes.           ",Stanford Advanced Wound Care Center Clinical Research

"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9422711,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organizational Models', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Violence', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2018,253856,0.01944132164662546
"Clinical practice patterns and healthcare resource utilization in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: using real world data to bridge the evidence gap PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This F32 fellowship award will provide Dr. Erica Farrand with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented clinical research in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); (2) to develop a unique skill set in collecting, analyzing and interpreting real-world data; (3) to gain advanced skills in epidemiology, biostatistics and data science methods to conduct clinical research; (4) to advance the IPF field by improving our understanding of the clinical impact of acute exacerbation of IPF. To achieve these goals, Dr. Farrand will conduct clinical investigations in two distinct healthcare systems, the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Health and Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). IPF is a progressive fibrotic lung disease associated with high morbidity and mortality and over $1 billion in healthcare cost annually. Acute exacerbation of IPF, is an acute respiratory deterioration and arguably the most clinically significant event in the natural history of the disease. The fundamental aim of this NRSA proposal is to leverage the electronic health records of UCSF Health and KPNC to generate real-world evidence regarding the epidemiology of acute exacerbation of IPF, the nature and variability of its clinical management and health care utilization across settings, and the impact of common management strategies on clinical outcomes. Research in this fellowship will utilize electronic health record data to define the acute exacerbation population using a case-validated diagnostic algorithm (Aim 1), document the scope and impact of acute exacerbation on clinical practice and healthcare resource utilization, comparing the UCSF and KPNC systems (Aim 2), and determine the association of common management approaches with hospital based and short-term patient-outcomes (Aim 3). This project will demonstrate the power of leveraging high-quality electronic health record data to both advance our understanding of a clinical condition and document the association of treatment interventions with patient and system level outcomes NARRATIVE Episodes of acute respiratory deterioration known as acute exacerbations are the most clinically significant events in the natural history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and limited data exist to guide the management of acute exacerbations of IPF. The impact of acute exacerbations on health care resource utilization across health care settings has not been characterized. Leveraging high-quality real-world data from the electronic health records of two large medical systems, we will address this knowledge gap by defining the clinical impact of acute exacerbation of IPF on the patient and healthcare system level; this work will demonstrate the power of real-world data for clinical research, and lay the foundation for future pragmatic studies of IPF.",Clinical practice patterns and healthcare resource utilization in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: using real world data to bridge the evidence gap,9610527,F32HL143920,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulation', 'Award', 'Bilateral', 'Biometry', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Intensive Care', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Lung diseases', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Management', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'System', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventilator', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'comparative effectiveness', 'day length', 'disease natural history', 'effectiveness trial', 'electronic data', 'evidence based guidelines', 'health care service utilization', 'health care settings', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'pragmatic trial', 'prognostic', 'prospective test', 'respiratory', 'skills', 'survival outcome']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2018,71077,-0.020016768975478674
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9548627,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2018,573677,0.01828911238562244
"Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury No abstract available PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis has been shown to be a key contributing factor for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). To date, there are no available targeted therapies for sepsis-associated AKI besides supportive care with antibiotics and fluids. The long-term goal of this project is to find new therapeutics for sepsis-associated AKI by first identifying sub-phenotypes based on clinical and biomarker profiles that may inform the molecular pathways of injury and then determining their association with adverse outcomes.",Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury,9611100,F32DK118870,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Acute Kidney Tubular Necrosis', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Allergic', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibiotics', 'Apoptotic', 'Aspirin', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Failure', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Fluid Balance', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Oliguria', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary to', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Urine', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cell injury', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lung injury', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'renal ischemia', 'research study', 'response', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'tubular necrosis']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2018,81158,-0.0019478533573917107
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,9566167,K01DK110136,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2018,154915,0.006288594393864587
"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data.

"Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represent a major global public health problem, with an ICU incidence of 10.4% and an associated mortality rate of 35-45%. Early detection of ARDS is essential for appropriate application of Lung Protective Ventilation, the only therapeutic intervention demonstrated to improve mortality in mechanically ventilated patients with established ARDS. In response to this need, tools that electronically monitor ABG results and interpret radiology reports of CXR findings for evidence of ARDS criteria in mechanically ventilated patients have been developed and deployed in critical care settings. Although these tools have been sufficiently accurate to detect ARDS, they fail to detect early stages of disease progression, prior to full-blown ARDS development, in at risk patients. Recent initiatives are focused on tools to identify patients in very early stages of ARDS before wide-spread alveolar damage has occurred, enabling strategies focused on prevention of ARDS development. Among efforts to use EMR data to reliably identify patients at high risk of developing ARDS, the most notable are the Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) and the “early acute lung injury” score (EALI). Validation studies show these promising tools have discriminating performance with an area under ROC curve (AUC) in the .7-.8 range, and demonstrate risk detection early in the course of illness, well in advance of frank respiratory failure. Our vision is to build on these efforts, and derive a highly automated early identification algorithm based on routinely captured medical record data that reliably and accurately identifies trajectories associated with post-exposure to specific classes of risk factors that predicts patients at risk for development of ARDS with an AUC discrimination in excess of .95. We believe the predictive performance of existing ARDS screening tools can be significantly improved by: 1) combined use of highly specific/sensitive cognitive/explanatory models to help guide machine learning by reducing “label noise” and identifying specific risk-induced trajectories associated with progression to ARDS; 2) exploring a full constellation of predictive risk factors not yet addressed by earlier efforts; 3) use of advanced natural language processing technology to extract ARDS risk information from free text clinical reports, and 4) use of enhanced machine learning algorithms that are label noise tolerant and combine the predictive power of nonparametric algorithms with the feature interpretability associated with parametric techniques. Despite advances in critical care medicine, mortality among patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) remains high, up to 45% for severe cases. There is no proven pharmacological treatment for ARDS; current treatment approaches focus on providing supportive care. Consequently, there is great community interest in targeted prevention of ARDS. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a highly predictive real-time ARDS surveillance software system that can be routinely used in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome, enabling interventions that can reduce the progression to full-blown disease. Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning, machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable ARDS mortality in hospitalized patients.",Rule Based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Early Identification of Patients at Risk of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS),9345675,R43HL135909,"['Acute Lung Injury', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Berlin', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Environmental air flow', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'ICD-9', 'Immune response', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Onset of illness', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Physiological', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary to', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'base', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'lung injury', 'mortality', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'response', 'screening', 'software systems', 'syndromic surveillance', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,149470,0.003119141518032199
"Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization. PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Modern digital pathology departments produce a tremendous amount of whole slide image data, which is quickly growing to petabyte scale. This plethora of data presents an unprecedented treasure chest for all kinds of medical machine learning tasks, including improvements in precision medicine.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of digital slides are not annotated on the image level, so histological points of interest are not integrated with the clinical notes or genetics associated with a patient. In contrast to other disciplines, manual labeling is not only cumbersome and time-consuming, but given the decades-long training of a pathologist, it is exorbitantly expensive and, due to clinical time constraints, impractical. Moreover, the time- dependent relationship between a patient's histology and genotype is not quantitatively leveraged to recommend combination therapies. Genetics informs us of important driver mutations, but how multiple cell types interact with these mutants over time in the tumor microenvironment to become histologically evident is less clear.  Deep learning synthesizes generations of pathologist knowledge as accurate quantitative models. Given a picture of a patient's morphology, I provide a tool that in four seconds finds the top ten most similar patients with their diagnoses, to support a pathologist's diagnosis decisions under the time pressures of active surgery. Recording the pathologist inspecting a slide at the microscope automatically annotates observed slide regions with time. Not only amenable for learning models that predict whether or not a region is salient to a pathologist making a diagnosis, this also allows all slides in a hospital to be annotated to identical criteria with only a representative sample of slides. I have submitted a manuscript reporting 85.15% accuracy in this saliency pre- diction task. This annotation greatly simplifies machine learning tasks, which can now focus on a non-redundant set of diagnostic regions in the slide, whether the application is to (a) find similar patients by morphology for diagnosis or (b) relate diagnostic morphology to the genetics.  Statistically modeling the relationship of the genotype to the histological phenotype in cancer opens promising new avenues in precision medicine. Taking a Big Data approach, I will leverage over 18,244 paired genome-histology samples to learn this model, using transfer learning techniques to maximize the value of all 18,244 samples for each tissue type. Genotype-phenotype model in hand, I will simulate the molecular clock in cancer, incrementally mutating the genome and predicting corresponding histology at each molecular time step. Through similar Q-learning that powers Google's champion artificial intelligence ``AlphaGo'', I will learn an agent that inhibits expression of a small set of mutant genes to maximize cancer progression-free survival time, by molecular time in the simulator. This not only measures the therapy's evolutionary durability, but also leads directly to experimentally testable hypotheses in 3D cell culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Digitized whole slide images of cancer tissue are a ``dark matter'' in the clinic, data that are often collected but rarely used quantitatively to model cancer or personalize medicine. I will, through close collaborations with practicing pathologists at globally leading cancer research hospitals, form statistical models of the histology evident in whole slides to (i) create clinical decision support tools that find similar patients by morphology alone to disambiguate cases that are difficult for a pathologist to diagnose under the time pressures of ongoing surgery, (ii) create a tool that learns which parts of a whole slide image are salient for a pathologist at the microscope to make a diagnosis, which greatly facilitates the deep learning techniques underlying [i] and [iii] by discarding redundant histological image data, and (iii) create a system that relates genotype to histological phenotype in cancer and learns an agent which leverages this system to determine the optimal multistage combination therapy to drive the histology towards health such that cancer progression-free survival time is maximized in the patient of interest. In this way, my statistical models will transform the vast dark matter of diagnosed histology data, representing generations of pathologist knowledge at these leading hospitals, into an indispensable resource for surgery, pathology, genetics, and precision medicine.","Genotype and Histological Phenotype Relationships in Cancer, with Automated Therapy Optimization.",9258847,F31CA214029,"['Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'CDH1 gene', 'Cancer Model', 'Cells', 'Chest', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Drug Combinations', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'FGFR3 gene', 'Farming environment', 'Freezing', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Medicine', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Second Opinions', 'Slide', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Suppressor Genes', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'actionable mutation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer imaging', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'dark matter', 'digital', 'histological image', 'histological specimens', 'improved', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'molecular marker', 'mutant', 'overexpression', 'personalized medicine', 'petabyte', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'support tools', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F31,2017,44044,-0.010792569756567241
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9247214,R01GM117622,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,598066,0.007661977563789747
"QuBBD: Deep Poisson Methods for Biomedical Time-to-Event and Longitude Data  The proposed research directly addresses the mission of NIH's BD2K initiative by developing appropriate tools to derive novel insights from available Big Data and by adapting sophisticated machine learning methodology to a framework familiar to biomedical researchers. This new methodology will be one of the first to enable use of machine learning techniques with time-to-event and continuous longitudinal outcome data, and will be the first such extension of the deep Poisson model. In essence, this undertaking builds the missing bridge between the need for advanced prognostic and predictive techniques among biomedical and clinical researchers and the unrealized potential of deep learning methods in the context of biomedical data collected longitudinally. To facilitate smooth adoption in clinical research, the results will be translated into terms familiar to applied practitioners through publications and well-described software packages. The application of the methodology developed will be illustrated using data from the NIH dbGAP repository, thereby further promoting the use of open access data sources. Optimal risk models are essential to realize the promise of precision medicine. This project develops novel machine learning methods for time-to-event and continuous longitudinal data to enhance risk model performance by exploiting correlations between large numbers of predictors and genetic data.

"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio) statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offer and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from four different departments within four different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts, and Information Science in the School of Information. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high-dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and response for our pilot offering in 2015 with 153 applications for 20 positions and a yield rate of 80% from the offers we extended. We plan to build on the success of this initial offering in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2016-2018). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a no-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 30 undergraduates nationally and expose them to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by UM researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world.

"Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Patient Level Decision Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Organ Acceptance Decision Making Only 15,652 of nearly 109,000 waitlisted patients for kidney transplant (KT) received one in 2014. More than six thousand died while waiting for a KT and more than two thousand became too sick to be transplanted. Patient survival, quality of life, and morbidity is significantly worse for those who remain on dialysis. The majority of kidneys that are transplanted are recovered from deceased donors. In 2014, while 12,664 kidneys were recovered for KT, 2,272 were discarded - most frequently due to being of marginal or low quality. Many of the discarded kidneys are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. Previous studies show that the marginal kidneys offer survival benefits with respect to remaining on dialysis, but neglect quantification of these benefits to an individual patient. These studies ignore two major issues: (i) the low c-statistics of one and three year post-transplant patient and graft survival models; and (ii) dynamics of the organ offers and the current point based priority system for the waitlisted patients. Given these facts, from a decision maker's perspective, accepting or rejecting a low quality organ is not necessarily a well informed choice.  The proposed research takes a comprehensive approach in developing a survival model incorporating time on dialysis, recipient characteristics, transplant center characteristics, and donated kidney characteristics. It proposes to apply techniques from biostatistics and machine learning to improve model accuracy. The research further aims to quantify the dynamics of kidney availability of different quality organs, and model future kidney offers as a stochastic decision tree. The proposed computational engine for estimating the survival benefits of accepting or rejecting an offer will be transformative in clinical decision making. Moreover, th successful completion of the proposed research will provide a highly reliable approach to support kidney acceptance/rejection decisions. The research will be carried out by a trans- disciplinary team with expert knowledge in the transplant allocation system, decision methodologies, and clinical decision making. The research team will incorporate input from an external advisory board consisting of leaders and key stakeholders in kidney and pancreas transplant programs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The transplantation system in the United States discards hundreds of recovered kidneys annually. Many of the discarded kidneys are of marginal quality and are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. The proposed research will take a comprehensive approach to accurately quantify patient survival and implications of accepting a kidney towards developing a decision support engine.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder. In this project, we propose to develop a fully automatic image post-processing pipeline and multidimensional big data analyses based on machine learning techniques, with the aim to uncover latent information from complex dataset and with the ultimate goal of setting up a platform for OA precision medicine",Multidimensional MRI-based Big Data Analytics to Study Osteoarthritis,9385849,K99AR070902,"['Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'California', 'Cartilage', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Institutes', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'career development', 'cartilage degradation', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging scientist', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'kinematics', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'parallel processing', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'racial difference', 'repository', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2017,94041,-0.0023232914264110084
"Autonomous system supporting patient-specific transfer and discharge decisions Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to improve the utility of AutoTriage, a machine-learning based clinical decision support (CDS) system, by integrating clinician intervention medical information into its predictions. Despite identified needs for CDS systems in patient transfer and discharge decisions, existing tools do not meet high standards for sensitivity and specificity. This is because current CDS methods are unable to distinguish changes in patient health due to clinician intervention from those arising due to an internal homeostatic mechanism. Thus, for example, existing tools may erroneously suggest discharge for a patient currently undergoing a life-sustaining treatment. Research Question: Can machine learning principles be used to create a classifier which incorporates signs of clinical intervention to inform transfer and discharge decision support, ultimately leading to higher quality predictions? In addition, will such a tool be able to maintain its performance when tested on a different patient population or one for which the data quality is much poorer? Prior Work: We have developed AutoTriage, a machine learning-based CDSS for 12-hour mortality prediction. On the publicly available MIMIC-III retrospective data set, this system attains an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88, which is superior to commonly used triage scores MEWS (AUROC = 0.75), SOFA (0.71), and SAPS-II (0.72) on the same data set. Specific Aims: To integrate clinician intervention information into existing AutoTriage software (Aim 1), and to test the robustness of this modified tool to changes in patient population and data quality (Aim 2). Methods: We will create gold standards for periods of clinician intervention, using chart events and keywords from clinician notes. Then, we will train a binary classifier for identifying these periods and, ultimately, use the classifier to modify AutoTriage scores. Robustness studies will be performed on the retrospective UC ReX and sparse MIMIC III databases. Successful completion of Aim 1will be demonstrated if 75% of all hours of clinician intervention are correctly classified, if the test-set area under the ROC curve improves by 5% over its current value, and if 30-day readmission predictions are 10% more accurate for patients treated within the last hour. Aim 2 will be completed if AutoTriage ROC area performance is within ± 0.10 of its original value for both UC ReX and sparse MIMIC III sets. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the AutoTriage system will be deployed at the sites of our ongoing clinical implementations. During this study, we project that AutoTriage will assess mortality risk for 25,000 ICU patients per year, helping clinicians more effectively allocate interventions totaling $15 million. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems aid medical professionals by presenting them with information needed to make better decisions about patient care, often in the form of alerts. To be of practical benefit, CDS tools must provide recommendations which accurately reflect the ongoing treatment provided by the clinician. We propose to incorporate knowledge of a clinician’s actions, like the administration of fluids or of antibiotics, into a CDS tool in order to improve the assessment of a patient’s ability to be discharged or transferred safely.",Autonomous system supporting patient-specific transfer and discharge decisions,9256278,R43NR015945,"['Address', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deterioration', 'Event', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'high standard', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend']",NINR,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2017,347772,-0.01038523173542363
"Adapting the Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack to Genomics and Health Project Summary We propose building a computational platform based on the high performance Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack (BDAS) to support a new ecosystem of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) applications. This platform will make it faster, easier, and less expensive to develop molecular Clinical Decision Support Systems. These systems require real-time queries of globally distributed data, efficient machine learning on large genomic datasets, and must be secure, fault-tolerant and scalable. BDAS and associated technologies are designed to help us meet these challenges and are therefore ideal building blocks to help us create our computational platform. To encourage the adoption of standards for the querying and sharing of large genomic datasets, we will adapt the BDAS stack to support the standards of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). Project Narrative Funding this work will help establish a production quality FOSS implementation of the important Global Alliance for Genomics and Health standards.

"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9306637,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'forest', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2017,340545,-0.006754053504651251
"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates belo 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,9278178,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data archive', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,543819,-0.021978490766083932
"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

UC Irvine is ideally suited to host a short course to address this thematic training deficit on account of the synergistic colocalization between multiple facilities, renowned for development of numerous advanced imaging techniques, and the outstanding instructional environment provided by faculty with collaborative expertise in biological image processing and computer vision, bioinformatics and high performance computational approaches.  Specifically, our BigDIPA proposal assembles an interdisciplinary alliance of faculty experts that can leverage the preeminent imaging resource facilities, such as the Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) and the Beckman Laser Institute, and fuse these to ongoing campus big data initiatives, e.g. UCI's Data Science Initiative, to create a top-rated training course designed for senior graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty and industry scientists from diverse scientific disciplines who have nascent interests and needs to handle BIG DATA sources beyond their current level of competency.  The course theme is focused to utilize discreet examples drawn from the analysis of complex data acquired from different microscopy imaging modalities employed to investigate dynamics in cellular and tissue processes, including signal transduction networks, development, neuroscience and biomedical applications, and that hereto where hidden or inaccessible to standard methods of analysis. Participants will be guided along the complete acquisition- processing-analysis pipeline through exposure to a coherent progression of topics and issues typically encountered when handling BIG DATA. We believe this training approach will therefore be attractive to a broad and significant untapped pool of researchers from the biological disciplines, biomedical engineering, systems biology, math, biophysics, computer science, bioinformatics and statistics who possess some, but not all, of the requisite competencies to effectively traverse the BD2K landscape. We have designed the course such that skills and experience gained by trainees will be transferable to their own research interests.  The BigDIPA course format will combine didactic lectures on the theory and foundational frameworks that underpin each step, with practical instruction on implementation and hands-on tutorials in image acquisition, large data handling, basic scripting of computational tools, image processing on high performance computing architectures, as well as feature extraction, evaluation and visualization of results. The course is designed to offer an intense learning experience delivered in a compact time frame, and opportunities to foster interdisciplinary interactions through small team exercises. Participants will also be encouraged to take advantage of pre-courses - separate and distinct training opportunities not funded by this proposal - that will be coordinated to directly precede our course. This unique format provides multiple benefits: it provides an efficient mechanism to address individual participant training deficiencies to permit a more productive experience in the BigDIPA course, adds no-cost mutual benefits to independent but synergistic programs, and facilitates recruitment of applicants who frequently feel interested but intimidated due to a perceived lack of prior adequate training.  Beyond providing an intensive on-site training course, all course materials (lecture notes, video lectures and tutorials), tutorial exercises, open source software resources and sample datasets will be made freely available through on-line distribution to maximize outreach and encourage additional contributions of curated training resources solicited from the community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to train and expand the cadre of researchers capable of effectively using the deluge of complex BIG DATA being generated by advanced biomedical imaging approaches. These data sources represent a rich source of complex information relevant to many scientific areas of inquiry, and are informative at multiple scales ranging from fundamental biological processes at the cellular level to patient diagnostics for diseases such as cancer or neurological disorders.",The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis,9295026,R25EB022366,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biophysics', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Systems Biology', 'Talents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'big biomedical data', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'biomedical scientist', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'course implementation', 'data acquisition', 'data format', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning materials', 'lecture notes', 'lectures', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'open source', 'outreach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'training opportunity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R25,2017,161997,0.046912017100647393

"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,9278954,R25MH112480,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Habits', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'design', 'e-science', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'lectures', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'project-based learning', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer institute', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2017,205185,0.020061471702435475
"QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a combination of innovative statistical and data visualization approaches using patient-generated health data, including mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable devices and smartphones, and patient-reported outcomes, to improve outcomes for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). This research will offer new insights into how to process and transform patient-generated health data into precise lifestyle recommendations to help achieve remission of symptoms. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To develop new preprocessing methods for publicly available, heterogeneous, time-varied mHealth data to develop a high quality mHealth dataset; 2) To develop and apply novel machine learning methods to obtain accurate predictions and formal statistical inference for the influence of lifestyle features on disease activity in IBDs; and 3) To design and develop innovative, interactive data visualization tools for knowledge discovery. The methods developed in the areas of preprocessing of mHealth data, calibration for mHealth devices, machine learning, and interactive data visualization will be broadly applicable to other mHealth data, chronic conditions beyond IBDs, and other fields in which the data streams are highly variable, intermittent, and periodic. This work is highly relevant to the mission of the NIH BD2K initiative which supports the development of innovative and transformative approaches and tools to accelerate the integration of Big Data and data science into biomedical research. This project will also enhance training in the development and use of methods for biomedical Big Data science and mentor the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists. The proposed research is relevant to public health by seeking to improve symptoms for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, which are chronic, life-long conditions with waxing and waning symptoms.

"Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Big data"" such as those arising from sequencing, imaging, genomics and other emerging technologies are playing a critical role in modern biology and medicine. The generation of hypotheses about biological processes and disease mechanisms is now increasingly being driven by the production and analysis of large and complex datasets. Advanced computational methods have been developed for the robust analysis of these datasets, and the growth in number and sophistication of these methods has closely tracked the growth in volume and complexity of biomedical data. In such a crowded environment of diverse computational methods and data, it is difficult to judge how generalizable the performance of these methods is from one setting to another. Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have now become popular mechanisms for the rigorous, blinded and unbiased evaluation of the performance of these methods and the identification of best-performing methods for biomedical problems. However, despite the benefits of these challenges to the biomedical research enterprise, the impact of their findings has been remarkably limited in laboratory and clinical settings. This is likely due to two important aspects of current challenges: (i) their over-emphasis on identifying the ""best"" solutions rather than tryig to comprehensively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submitted solutions, and (ii) the absence of a stable channel of communication and collaboration between problem and solution providers due to a lack of sufficient incentives to do so. The aim of this project is to boost the translational impact of scientific challenges through a combination of novel machine learning methods, development of novel scalable software and unique collaborations with disease experts to ensure the effective translation of knowledge accrued in challenges to real clinical settings and practice. These novel methods and software are designed to effectively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submissions to challenges into ""ensemble"" solutions. In a first of its kind effort, the ensemble solutions derived from disease-focused challenges under the DREAM project will be brought directly to scientists and clinicians that are experts in these disease areas. Initial effort in this project will focus on active DREAM challenges aiming at the accurate prediction of drug response and clinical outcomes respectively in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Both these diseases are difficult to treat and thus they pose major medical and public health concerns. In collaboration with RA and AML experts, the ensemble solutions learnt in these challenges will be validated in independent patient cohorts and carefully designed clinical studies. This second-level validation is essential to judge the clinical applicability of any method, but is rarely done As the methodology is general, similar efforts will be made for other diseases in later stages of the project. Overall, using a smart combination of crowdsourcing-based challenges and computational methods and software, we aim to demonstrate a unique pathway for studying and treating disease by truly leveraging the ""wisdom of the crowds"". PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have become a popular mechanism to identify innovative solutions to complex biomedical problems. However, the collective effort of all the challenge participants has been under utilized, and the overall impact on actual clinical and laboratory practice has been remarkably limited. Using novel computational methods and novel ""big data""-friendly software implementation, we plan to demonstrate how biomedical challenges, combined with our approach, can influence clinical practice in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Rheumatoid Arthritis, as well as rigorously validate our approach.",Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning,9251828,R01GM114434,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'innovation', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge translation', 'learning progression', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stem', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2017,428512,0.01465082703672705
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9405530,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2017,680002,0.0010073585939949987
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9207492,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749226,-0.001876433843743926
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9323604,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'pediatric department', 'performance tests', 'portability', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2017,1500000,0.010031322987278329
"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9147605,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'molecular imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'response biomarker', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,188952,0.01291440236613993
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias. Results from this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations.",Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae,9309288,R01MH110453,"['Accidents', 'Address', 'Attention', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Denmark', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Etiology', 'Explosion', 'Family', 'Fire - disasters', 'Future', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Opiates', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personality Disorders', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poisoning', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pregnancy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Steroids', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Variant', 'Work', 'assault', 'base', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'member', 'novel', 'population based', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'sexual assault', 'social', 'time use', 'tool', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2017,319091,-0.0015280512850420886
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9310000,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,144298,-0.026207722593500522
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9198041,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency research', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2017,163944,-0.018165017216047963
"A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inception of the BD2K Initiative is a testament to the foresight of NIH and our community. Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data. Capitalizing on our investigators' complementary strengths in computational biology and cardiovascular medicine, we will present a fusion of cutting-edge innovations that are grounded in a cardiovascular research focus, encompassing: (i) on-the-cloud data processing, (ii) crowd sourcing and text-mining data annotation, (iii) protein spatiotemporal dynamics, (iv) multi-omic integration, and (v) multiscale clinical data modeling. Drawing from our decade of experience in creating and refining bioinformatics tools, we propose to amalgamate established Big Data resources into a generalizable model for data annotation and collaborative research, through a new query system and cloud infrastructure for accessing multiple omics repositories, and through computational-supported crowdsourcing initiatives for mining the biomedical literature. We propose to interweave diverse data types for revealing biological networks that coalesce from molecular entities at multiple scales, through machine learning methods for structuring molecular data and defining relationships with drugs and diseases, and through novel algorithms for on-the-cloud integration and pathway visualization of multi-dimensional molecular data. Moreover, we propose to innovate advanced modeling tools to resolve protein dynamics and spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms, through mechanistic modeling of protein properties and 3D protein expression maps, and through Bayesian algorithms that correlate patient phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles. The utility and customizability o our tools to the broader research population is clearly demonstrated using three archetypical workflows that enable annotations of large lists of genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites; powerful analysis of complex protein datasets acquired over time; and seamless aQoregation of diverse molecular, textual and literature data. These workflows will be rigorously validated using data from two significant clinical cohorts, the Jackson Heart Study and the Healthy Elderly Longevity (Wellderly). In parallel, a multifaceted strategy will be implemented to educate and train biomedical investigators, and to engage the public for promoting the overall BD2K initiative. We are convinced that a community-driven BD2K initiative will best realize its scientific potential and transform the research culture in a sustainable manner, exhibiting lasting success beyond the current funding period.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The challenges of biomedical Big Data are multifaceted. Biomedical investigators face daunting tasks of storing, analyzing, and distributing large-scale omics data, and aggregating all information to discern mechanistic insights. A coherent effort is required to harness disarrayed Big Data and transform them into intelligible scientific facts, whil engaging the global community via education and outreach programs. This Big Data Science Research proposal is designed to address these challenges by formulating a federated architecture of community-supported tools for enhancing data management, integration and analysis.            ",A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform,9298691,U54GM114833,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Intuition', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population Research', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'big biomedical data', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'data resource', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'molecular scale', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'protein complex', 'protein expression', 'protein metabolite', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'support tools', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U54,2017,168436,0.03906528819463109
"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,9431875,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Rearing', 'Child health care', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependency', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2017,139492,-0.003237075603278287
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments. High-resolution electronic health data may provide a clear picture of evolving ARDS; leveraging this data to develop automated systems for ARDS diagnosis will help ensure patients with ARDS are recognized early and receive timely, evidence-based treatments.",Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,9292908,K01HL136687,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'design', 'digital', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'health data', 'high risk', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'respiratory health']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2017,172444,0.025326369734037735
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",9321191,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Sociology', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predicting response', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2017,165886,0.0004982319516755734
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9306838,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2017,194400,0.003948021771442194
"High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs ABSTRACT In this application we will perform high throughput, high content, screening for small molecules that improve kidney regeneration after acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI presents a dire unmet medical need because of its high prevalence with long-term adverse health effects and life-threatening sequelae. Mortality is high and the only effective treatments are renal replacement therapies. The onset of the precipitating event is unpredictable, and in many instances once patients are admitted to the hospital, injury has already occurred. Improving recovery from injury therefore presents an attractive opportunity for intervention, but to date, no therapies are available that are effective if administered post injury. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate and follows a well-defined cellular mechanism that encompasses dedifferentiation of surviving renal tubule cells, proliferation of resulting progenitors, and repopulation of the denuded tubule. This sequence of events, together with their respective molecular markers, is conserved between humans, mouse, and zebrafish. During regeneration, transcription factors normally expressed during organogenesis (e.g.,lhx1a, pax2, and pax8) are reactivated. We previously demonstrated that small molecule-mediated augmentation of endogenous Lhx1a expression can ameliorate recovery in zebrafish and mouse models of AKI. Together these data support the overall hypothesis that augmentation by small molecules of cellular programs that drive kidney repair after injury represents a novel pharmacologic approach for the treatment of AKI and associated sequelae. Using a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses Lhx1a-EGFP we have developed an artificial intelligence-based, high-content assay to quantify lhx1a expression in the living embryo. Using multivariate analysis, the assay met accepted HTS assay performance standards and was validated in three-day variability studies and a small pilot library screen. We will perform a primary HTS of 50,000 compounds from the MLPCN collection. Prioritized hits will be subjected to a fully implemented, rigorous secondary assay paradigm encompassing kidney organ development, metabolic stability, in vivo efficacy, and activity profiling in a pathophysiological relevant AKI model. At the end of these studies we will have identified functionally and mechanistically characterized in vivo chemical probes to investigate the biology of kidney injury and regeneration, some of which are expected to have features that make them suitable for development into preclinical leads. NARRATIVE Acute kidney injury (AKI) presents a dire unmet medical need with unacceptably high mortality rates and a lack of therapeutic modalities. The vertebrate kidney has an innate ability to regenerate that can be enhanced by small molecules. In this proposal we will perform high-content, high throughput screening for kidney regeneration in zebrafish to discover novel chemical probes to investigate mechanisms of augmented kidney regeneration after injury.",High content in vivo screening for acute kidney injury ameliorating drugs,9262478,R01DK112652,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Breeding', 'Carboxylic Acids', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Ensure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fibrosis', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Microsomes', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Bank', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Organogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Prodrugs', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Renal tubule structure', 'Reproducibility', 'Specificity', 'Stem cells', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic effect', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tubular formation', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'kidney repair', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'organ growth', 'organ regeneration', 'pre-clinical', 'progenitor', 'programs', 'repository', 'response', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2017,348188,0.040682559766377774
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9324356,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2017,198838,0.0005640122044605493
"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,9297324,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,404000,-0.027125259127336064

"A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients Abstract Septic shock is a severe condition resulting in a critical reduction of organ perfusion with consequential and common stage 2 and 3 acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in as many as 60% of patients and with an alarmingly high in-hospital co-morbid mortality rate of up to 70%. Current Surviving Sepsis Guidelines recommend early aggressive fluid resuscitation targeting mean arterial pressure (MAP≥ 65 mmHg); however aggressive resuscitation commonly results in hypervolemia. Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), which occurs frequently in critically ill patients, is recognized as a vital parameter reflecting venous outflow that has wide-ranging physiologic effects including an association with AKI. Thus, abdominal perfusion pressure (APP=MAP-IAP) may provide the optimal target to guide hemodynamic support as it reflects both inflow (MAP) and outflow (IAP) perfusion. However, current methods of IAP measurement limit the validation of APP as a hemodynamic target as they are prone to (1) human error, limiting the reproducibility of measurements and (2) contamination resulting in catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Potrero Medical, Inc. has developed the Accuryn Monitoring System, which accurately, automatically and digitally extracts physiological data in real-time from the bladder, without the need for external equipment or manual manipulation. Accuryn received formal 510(k) clearance from the FDA for measurement of IAP, urine output and core temperature in April of 2016. In combination with MAP acquired through standard of care, Accuryn will enable APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation in septic shock patients. In this grant, the use of Accuryn to improve clinical outcomes in septic shock patients via both IAP monitoring and APP-targeted hemodynamic resuscitation will be validated. We plan to conduct a 24-month clinical trial with 200 septic shock patients divided among three groups: (1) Monitoring (normal IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), (2) Standard of Care MAP group (elevated IAP receiving MAP-targeted resuscitation), and (3) APP group (elevated IAP receiving APP≥ 60 mmHg targeted resuscitation. The primary endpoint for comparison will be incidence or progression (defined by peak severity in creatinine and UO compared to baseline levels) of stage 2 and 3 AKI. Secondary endpoints include ICU- and hospital mortality, frequency and duration of RRT, urinary biomarker data, days on mechanical ventilation, mean duration of vasopressor support, and adverse events. Independent comparisons between these groups will (1) verify that elevated IAP during fluid resuscitation is correlated with AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of stage 2 and 3 AKI in septic shock patients compared to MAP-guided resuscitation. With this clinical study, we will validate the need for the Accuryn device to continuously measure IAP and target APP during resuscitation. The data collected from this grant will enable the design of a pivotal phase III clinical study defining APP- targeted hemodynamic support as the new standard of care for septic shock. Narrative Improving the resuscitation procedures in septic shock by (1) better gauging the patient’s volume status and (2) guiding hemodynamic support to individualized patient needs by a balanced, precision approach involving vasopressor support and targeted fluid expansion, may dramatically improve clinical outcomes including acute kidney injury. Potrero Medical intends use our Accuryn Monitoring System, to continuously measure intra- abdominal pressure (IAP) and apply the measure to target abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) during resuscitation to (1) verify the importance of IAP in the development of AKI in septic shock patients and (2) validate that APP-guided fluid resuscitation reduces the incidence or progression of AKI in septic shock patients compared to current standard care.",A Novel Device for Optimal and Personalized Fluid Therapy in Septic Shock Patients,9348493,R44GM123799,"['Abdomen', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Volume', 'Catheters', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consequentialism', 'Creatinine', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Employee Strikes', 'Equation', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Fluid overload', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Intra-abdominal', 'Joints', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mississippi', 'Monitor', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Venous', 'Work', 'abdominal pressure', 'catheter associated UTI', 'design', 'digital', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'urinary']",NIGMS,"POTRERO MEDICAL, INC.",R44,2017,1685221,-0.0016609868209461912
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9333122,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2017,401742,-0.0041757189184140325
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing integrated EMR early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early with the intent to ultimately refie the process of care for this group to minimize complication development.",Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data,9320947,K01ES026834,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood coagulation', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deltastab', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'care systems', 'career', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'injured', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2017,221780,0.04926899550355001

Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9369218,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2017,170466,0.009697334459711389
"Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers PROJECT SUMMARY As a computational biologist, my long-term goal is to develop methods and tools to discover new or better therapeutics for cancers. In the past few years, I have identified drug-repositioning candidates for a number of primary cancers using Big Data approaches. These candidates have been validated successfully in preclinical mouse models. To maximize the utility of Big Data, I plan to translate the findings into therapeutics; therefore, I propose to develop methods to utilize transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers. Current preclinical and clinical approaches including the NCI MATCH trial select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations, yet patients may have no actionable mutations or multiple actionable mutations that are hard to prioritize, suggesting the need for other different types of molecular biomarkers. The recent efforts have enabled the large-scale identification of various types of molecular biomarkers through correlating drug sensitivity with molecular profiles of pre-treatment cancer cell lines. Computational methods to match these biomarkers to individual patients to inform therapy in the clinic are thus in high demand. The objective of this award is therefore to develop computational approaches to identify therapeutics for individual patients by leveraging large-scale biomarkers identified from cancer cell lines. Through conducing this research, I expect to expand my knowledge in cancer clinical trials, cancer genomics, cancer biology, and statistics. To achieve the goal, I have gathered seven renowned experts from different fields related to Big Data Science as mentors/advisors/collaborators: Primary Mentor Dr. Atul Butte in translational bioinformatics from UCSF, Co-mentor Dr. Samuel So in cancer biology from Stanford University, Co-mentor Dr. Mark Segal in statistics from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Andrei Goga in cancer biology from UCSF, Advisor Dr. Laura Esserman in breast cancer trials from UCSF, Collaborator Dr. John Gordan in liver cancer trials from UCSF and Collaborator Dr. Xin Chen in cancer biology from UCSF. With the support from my world- class mentors, advisors and collaborators, this award will prepare me to be a leader in developing big data methods that are broadly impactful. PROJECT NARRATIVE One goal of the precision medicine initiative is to select optimal therapies for individual cancer patients based on their molecular and clinical profiles. Current preclinical and clinical approaches select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations. This work is expected to employ the protein/gene expression based biomarkers computed from public databases to inform individualized cancer therapy.","Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers",9324471,K01ES028047,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Alpha Cell', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Award', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genomic Data Commons', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Non-Malignant', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer clinical trial', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer therapy', 'data sharing', 'drug candidate', 'drug efficacy', 'drug sensitivity', 'efficacy testing', 'genetic signature', 'individual patient', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'protein expression', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2017,171216,-0.03235079440162732
"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9307982,R21HL133891,"['Acute', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effector Cell', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Four-dimensional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'design', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2017,180249,0.003097048495025073
"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9231462,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Injury', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Organizational Models', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Trauma Research', 'Violence', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'data resource', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2017,253856,0.01944132164662546
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9341177,U24CA199374,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Felis catus', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'analytical tool', 'annotation  system', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2017,579791,0.01828911238562244
"Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability Project Summary/Abstract: If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop cardiorespiratory instability (CRI), then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and better use care resources. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established and patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters and coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also showed that advanced HR variability analysis (sample entropy) identified SDU patients at CRI risk within 2 minutes, and if monitored for 5 minutes differentiated between patients who would develop CRI or remain stable over the next 48 hours. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable and invasively monitored ICU patients. We will develop multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques such as regression, Fourier and principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, random forest classification, etc. as well as more novel approaches (temporal rule learning developed by our team; Bayesian Aggregation) to predict CRI in ICU patients. We will first use our existing annotated high fidelity waveform MIMIC II clinical data set (4200 patients) to develop predictive models and differential signatures for various CRI drivers. We will also use our high-density data collection and processing platform (Bernoulli) to prospectively collect data from ICUs in three institutions: Univ. Pittsburgh (PITT), Univ. California (UC) Irvine and UC San Diego (initial algorithm development conducted at PITT and validated in the UC systems). We will identify the number and type of independent measures, sampling frequency, and lead time necessary to create robust algorithms to: 1) predict impending CRI, 2) select the most effective treatments, 3) monitor treatment response, and 4) determine when treatment has restored physiologic stability and can be stopped. We will also determine the smallest number and types of parameters coupled to the longest CRI lead time to achieve the above four targets with the best sensitivity and specificity (a concept we call Monitoring Parsimony).We will simultaneously iteratively design and test a graphical user interface (GUI) and clinical decision support system (CDSS) driven by these parsimoniously derived predictive smart alerts and functional hemodynamic monitoring treatment approaches in two human simulation environments (PITT & UC Irvine).We envision a basic monitoring surveillance that identifies patients most likely to develop CRI to apply focused clinician attention and targeted treatments to deliver highly personalized medical care. Public Health Narrative If one could accurately predict who, when and why patients develop shock then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve outcome and more effectively use healthcare resources. But signs of shock often occur late once organ injury is already present. The purpose of this study is to first develop multivariable models through data-driven classification techniques to parsimoniously predict cardiovascular insufficiency, etiology and response to treatment. We will do this first in our existing MIMIC II clinical data sets of 4200 ICU patients as to timing and types of instability. Then we will prospectively collect real time high- density data on patients admitted to our trauma intensive care units of University of Pittsburgh, UC Irvine and UC San Diego. We will create and test in simulators of ICU care bedside user interfaces to drive recognition and treatment algorithms based on these models in all three medical centers.",Machine learning of physiological variables to predict diagnose and treat cardiorespiratory instability,9029396,R01GM117622,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'California', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Homeostasis', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal Range', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'fitness', 'forest', 'graphical user interface', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'simulation', 'support tools', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,662537,0.007661977563789747
"Administrative Supplement Request for Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio) statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offer and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from four different departments within four different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts, and Information Science in the School of Information. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high-dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and response for our pilot offering in 2015 with 153 applications for 20 positions and a yield rate of 80% from the offers we extended. We plan to build on the success of this initial offering in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2016-2018). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a no-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 30 undergraduates nationally and expose them to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by UM researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world.

"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio) statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offer and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from four different departments within four different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts, and Information Science in the School of Information. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high-dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and response for our pilot offering in 2015 with 153 applications for 20 positions and a yield rate of 80% from the offers we extended. We plan to build on the success of this initial offering in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2016-2018). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a no-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 30 undergraduates nationally and expose them to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by UM researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school.

"Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Patient Level Decision Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Organ Acceptance Decision Making Only 15,652 of nearly 109,000 waitlisted patients for kidney transplant (KT) received one in 2014. More than six thousand died while waiting for a KT and more than two thousand became too sick to be transplanted. Patient survival, quality of life, and morbidity is significantly worse for those who remain on dialysis. The majority of kidneys that are transplanted are recovered from deceased donors. In 2014, while 12,664 kidneys were recovered for KT, 2,272 were discarded - most frequently due to being of marginal or low quality. Many of the discarded kidneys are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. Previous studies show that the marginal kidneys offer survival benefits with respect to remaining on dialysis, but neglect quantification of these benefits to an individual patient. These studies ignore two major issues: (i) the low c-statistics of one and three year post-transplant patient and graft survival models; and (ii) dynamics of the organ offers and the current point based priority system for the waitlisted patients. Given these facts, from a decision maker's perspective, accepting or rejecting a low quality organ is not necessarily a well informed choice.  The proposed research takes a comprehensive approach in developing a survival model incorporating time on dialysis, recipient characteristics, transplant center characteristics, and donated kidney characteristics. It proposes to apply techniques from biostatistics and machine learning to improve model accuracy. The research further aims to quantify the dynamics of kidney availability of different quality organs, and model future kidney offers as a stochastic decision tree. The proposed computational engine for estimating the survival benefits of accepting or rejecting an offer will be transformative in clinical decision making. Moreover, th successful completion of the proposed research will provide a highly reliable approach to support kidney acceptance/rejection decisions. The research will be carried out by a trans- disciplinary team with expert knowledge in the transplant allocation system, decision methodologies, and clinical decision making. The research team will incorporate input from an external advisory board consisting of leaders and key stakeholders in kidney and pancreas transplant programs.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The transplantation system in the United States discards hundreds of recovered kidneys annually. Many of the discarded kidneys are of marginal quality and are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. The proposed research will take a comprehensive approach to accurately quantify patient survival and implications of accepting a kidney towards developing a decision support engine.

"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis. The proposed work will be tested on human and cancer genome data, contributing to health IT, one of the National Priority Domain Areas.

"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates belo 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,9095389,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'data archive', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2016,548500,-0.021978490766083932
"Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data DESCRIPTION:  Funding is sought for the Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data (SISBID) at the University of Washington. This program will provide workshops on the statistical and computational skills needed to access, process, manage, and analyze large biomedical data sets. It will be co-directed by Ali Shojaie and Daniela Witten, faculty in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Washington.  The SISBID program will consist of five 2.5-day in-person courses, or modules, taught at the University of Washington each July. An individual participant can register for whichever set of modules he or she chooses. The five modules are as follows: (1) Accessing Biomedical Big Data; (2) Data Visualization; (3) Supervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (4) Unsupervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (5) Reproducible Research for Biomedical Big Data. Each module will consist of a combination of formal lectures and hands-on computing labs. Participants will work together in teams in order to apply the skills that they develop in each module to important problems drawn from relevant case studies.  The primary audience for SISBID will consist of biomedical scientists who would like to develop the statistical and computational training needed to make use of Biomedical Big Data. The secondary audience will consist of individuals with stronger statistical or computational backgrounds but little exposure to biology, who will learn how to apply their skills to problems associated with Biomedical Big Data. Participants will include advanced undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and researchers, and will be drawn from industry, government, and academia. In order to ensure that all participants are able to fully engage in the program, participants will be expected to already have some prior background in R programming and statistical inference, which can be obtained by taking two free online courses before the program begins.  Each of the five modules will be co-taught by two instructors. The ten instructors will be drawn from top universities and research centers across the U.S., such as the University of Washington, Rice University, University of Iowa, Johns Hopkins University, MD Anderson Cancer Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and University of North Carolina. They have been selected based on research expertise and excellence in teaching.  Lecture videos and slides will be made freely available online so that individuals who are unable to attend SISBID in person can still benefit from the program.  This proposal specifically requests funds for 55 student / postdoctoral fellow travel scholarships per year, 130 student / postdoctoral fellow registration scholarships per year, instructor travel and stipends, teaching assistant stipends, and PI salary support. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   In recent years, the biomedical sciences have been inundated by Big Data, such as DNA sequence data and electronic medical records. In principle, it should be possible to use such data for a variety of tasks, such as predicting an individual's risk of developing diabetes or cancer, and tailoring therapies to an individual should he or she become ill.

"The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to establish a national short course in Big Data Image Processing & Analysis (BigDIPA) intended to increase the number and overall skills of competent research scientists now encountering large, complex image data sources derived from cutting edge biological/biomedical research approaches. Extraction of knowledge from these imaging sources requires specialized skills and an interdisciplinary mindset. Yet effective training opportunities of this sector of the ""Big Data"" science community are glaringly underappreciated and underserved compared to other big data fields such as omics. UC Irvine is ideally suited to host a short course to address this thematic training deficit on account of the synergistic colocalization between multiple facilities, renowned for development of numerous advanced imaging techniques, and the outstanding instructional environment provided by faculty with collaborative expertise in biological image processing and computer vision, bioinformatics and high performance computational approaches.  Specifically, our BigDIPA proposal assembles an interdisciplinary alliance of faculty experts that can leverage the preeminent imaging resource facilities, such as the Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) and the Beckman Laser Institute, and fuse these to ongoing campus big data initiatives, e.g. UCI's Data Science Initiative, to create a top-rated training course designed for senior graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty and industry scientists from diverse scientific disciplines who have nascent interests and needs to handle BIG DATA sources beyond their current level of competency.  The course theme is focused to utilize discreet examples drawn from the analysis of complex data acquired from different microscopy imaging modalities employed to investigate dynamics in cellular and tissue processes, including signal transduction networks, development, neuroscience and biomedical applications, and that hereto where hidden or inaccessible to standard methods of analysis. Participants will be guided along the complete acquisition- processing-analysis pipeline through exposure to a coherent progression of topics and issues typically encountered when handling BIG DATA. We believe this training approach will therefore be attractive to a broad and significant untapped pool of researchers from the biological disciplines, biomedical engineering, systems biology, math, biophysics, computer science, bioinformatics and statistics who possess some, but not all, of the requisite competencies to effectively traverse the BD2K landscape. We have designed the course such that skills and experience gained by trainees will be transferable to their own research interests.  The BigDIPA course format will combine didactic lectures on the theory and foundational frameworks that underpin each step, with practical instruction on implementation and hands-on tutorials in image acquisition, large data handling, basic scripting of computational tools, image processing on high performance computing architectures, as well as feature extraction, evaluation and visualization of results. The course is designed to offer an intense learning experience delivered in a compact time frame, and opportunities to foster interdisciplinary interactions through small team exercises. Participants will also be encouraged to take advantage of pre-courses - separate and distinct training opportunities not funded by this proposal - that will be coordinated to directly precede our course. This unique format provides multiple benefits: it provides an efficient mechanism to address individual participant training deficiencies to permit a more productive experience in the BigDIPA course, adds no-cost mutual benefits to independent but synergistic programs, and facilitates recruitment of applicants who frequently feel interested but intimidated due to a perceived lack of prior adequate training.  Beyond providing an intensive on-site training course, all course materials (lecture notes, video lectures and tutorials), tutorial exercises, open source software resources and sample datasets will be made freely available through on-line distribution to maximize outreach and encourage additional contributions of curated training resources solicited from the community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to train and expand the cadre of researchers capable of effectively using the deluge of complex BIG DATA being generated by advanced biomedical imaging approaches. These data sources represent a rich source of complex information relevant to many scientific areas of inquiry, and are informative at multiple scales ranging from fundamental biological processes at the cellular level to patient diagnostics for diseases such as cancer or neurological disorders.",The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis,9150564,R25EB022366,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skills Development', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'biomedical scientist', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'course implementation', 'data acquisition', 'data format', 'demographics', 'design', 'education research', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning materials', 'lecture notes', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'open source', 'outreach', 'programs', 'repository', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tissue processing', 'training opportunity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R25,2016,161997,0.046912017100647393

"Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Big data"" such as those arising from sequencing, imaging, genomics and other emerging technologies are playing a critical role in modern biology and medicine. The generation of hypotheses about biological processes and disease mechanisms is now increasingly being driven by the production and analysis of large and complex datasets. Advanced computational methods have been developed for the robust analysis of these datasets, and the growth in number and sophistication of these methods has closely tracked the growth in volume and complexity of biomedical data. In such a crowded environment of diverse computational methods and data, it is difficult to judge how generalizable the performance of these methods is from one setting to another. Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have now become popular mechanisms for the rigorous, blinded and unbiased evaluation of the performance of these methods and the identification of best-performing methods for biomedical problems. However, despite the benefits of these challenges to the biomedical research enterprise, the impact of their findings has been remarkably limited in laboratory and clinical settings. This is likely due to two important aspects of current challenges: (i) their over-emphasis on identifying the ""best"" solutions rather than tryig to comprehensively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submitted solutions, and (ii) the absence of a stable channel of communication and collaboration between problem and solution providers due to a lack of sufficient incentives to do so. The aim of this project is to boost the translational impact of scientific challenges through a combination of novel machine learning methods, development of novel scalable software and unique collaborations with disease experts to ensure the effective translation of knowledge accrued in challenges to real clinical settings and practice. These novel methods and software are designed to effectively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submissions to challenges into ""ensemble"" solutions. In a first of its kind effort, the ensemble solutions derived from disease-focused challenges under the DREAM project will be brought directly to scientists and clinicians that are experts in these disease areas. Initial effort in this project will focus on active DREAM challenges aiming at the accurate prediction of drug response and clinical outcomes respectively in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Both these diseases are difficult to treat and thus they pose major medical and public health concerns. In collaboration with RA and AML experts, the ensemble solutions learnt in these challenges will be validated in independent patient cohorts and carefully designed clinical studies. This second-level validation is essential to judge the clinical applicability of any method, but is rarely done As the methodology is general, similar efforts will be made for other diseases in later stages of the project. Overall, using a smart combination of crowdsourcing-based challenges and computational methods and software, we aim to demonstrate a unique pathway for studying and treating disease by truly leveraging the ""wisdom of the crowds"". PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have become a popular mechanism to identify innovative solutions to complex biomedical problems. However, the collective effort of all the challenge participants has been under utilized, and the overall impact on actual clinical and laboratory practice has been remarkably limited. Using novel computational methods and novel ""big data""-friendly software implementation, we plan to demonstrate how biomedical challenges, combined with our approach, can influence clinical practice in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Rheumatoid Arthritis, as well as rigorously validate our approach.",Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning,9049511,R01GM114434,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge translation', 'learning progression', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'tool']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2016,428512,0.01465082703672705
"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's. n/a",BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO),9066173,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'learning strategy', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'predict clinical outcome', 'processing speed', 'reference genome', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'search engine', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2016,507805,-0.014618261809038084
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9260326,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'meetings', 'memory process', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2016,773219,0.0010073585939949987
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,9121614,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Mobility', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker panel', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2016,135270,0.018012035741614012
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9099840,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,144298,-0.026207722593500522
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8984911,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2016,163944,-0.018165017216047963
"Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination Project Summary / Abstract Between 1.6 and 3.8 million people each year suffer a mild TBI in the US alone. Reliable diagnosis and prompt treatments are vital to managing the often-serious short and long-term sequelae resulting from mild TBI. However, a reliable objective and accurate method for mild TBI diagnosis outside of a hospital setting, and in particular for determining RTP readiness, has eluded the clinical community. Current diagnosis and RTP assessments are based on patient symptoms, neurocognitive evaluations, and / or physical performance testing. Use of symptom scales are problematic for several reasons including subjectivity and reliability. Neurocognitive evaluations and physical tests (such as balance tests), although less subjective, require pre- injury baseline testing of subjects due to inherently large subject-to-subject variations in evaluation performances. Due to these reasons, current mild TBI diagnostic methods have limited applications and are not suitable for a significant majority of patients who suffer mild TBI. This project is aimed at developing an objective diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (mild TBI) based on physiologic changes in a patient after injury and providing a platform capable of RTP guidance. The method is based on quantification of well-known physiologic changes after a concussion, i.e. the impairment of autonomic function and altered cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured with transcranial Doppler (TCD). The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a recently-developed analytical machine learning framework for the analysis of the CBF velocity (CBFV) waveforms. In contrast to previous methods used before, the proposed approach utilizes the entire shape of the complex CBFV waveform, thus obtaining subtle changes in blood flow that are lost in other analysis methods. Additionally, comprehensive verification between our platform and MRI will be performed following injury resulting in the first scientific experiments of this kind. The ultimate goal of this Phase II SBIR is to commercialize an objective and accurate software algorithm for reliable diagnosis and management of sports concussions which does not currently exist. The outcome will be a software suite integrated into existing TCD and will be marketed to emergency departments, neurology clinics, and other healthcare providers involved in mild TBI diagnosis and RTP management. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health problem in the United States contributing to a substantial number of deaths and cases of permanent disability. Mild TBI concussions account for over 80% of all TBIs sustained and a major problem is the high rate of mis-diagnosis due to lack of objective measures and delayed onset of symptoms. This project aims to develop the first objective concussion evaluation method using a novel analysis platform that can obtain subtle, physiologic changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Successful completion of this project will result in a portable diagnostic device suitable for use in many scenarios where concussion diagnosis is inaccurate or unavailable today.",Advanced morphological analysis of cerebral blood flow for acute concussion diagnosis and return-to-play determination,9202982,R44NS092209,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area Under Curve', 'Assessment tool', 'Blood Flow Velocity', 'Blood flow', 'Brain Concussion', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Controlled Study', 'Core-Binding Factor', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neurology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Spin Labels', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'balance testing', 'base', 'brain health', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'hemodynamics', 'high school', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'success', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEURAL ANALYTICS, INC.",R44,2016,1500000,0.010031322987278329
"A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inception of the BD2K Initiative is a testament to the foresight of NIH and our community. Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data. Capitalizing on our investigators' complementary strengths in computational biology and cardiovascular medicine, we will present a fusion of cutting-edge innovations that are grounded in a cardiovascular research focus, encompassing: (i) on-the-cloud data processing, (ii) crowd sourcing and text-mining data annotation, (iii) protein spatiotemporal dynamics, (iv) multi-omic integration, and (v) multiscale clinical data modeling. Drawing from our decade of experience in creating and refining bioinformatics tools, we propose to amalgamate established Big Data resources into a generalizable model for data annotation and collaborative research, through a new query system and cloud infrastructure for accessing multiple omics repositories, and through computational-supported crowdsourcing initiatives for mining the biomedical literature. We propose to interweave diverse data types for revealing biological networks that coalesce from molecular entities at multiple scales, through machine learning methods for structuring molecular data and defining relationships with drugs and diseases, and through novel algorithms for on-the-cloud integration and pathway visualization of multi-dimensional molecular data. Moreover, we propose to innovate advanced modeling tools to resolve protein dynamics and spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms, through mechanistic modeling of protein properties and 3D protein expression maps, and through Bayesian algorithms that correlate patient phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles. The utility and customizability o our tools to the broader research population is clearly demonstrated using three archetypical workflows that enable annotations of large lists of genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites; powerful analysis of complex protein datasets acquired over time; and seamless aQoregation of diverse molecular, textual and literature data. These workflows will be rigorously validated using data from two significant clinical cohorts, the Jackson Heart Study and the Healthy Elderly Longevity (Wellderly). In parallel, a multifaceted strategy will be implemented to educate and train biomedical investigators, and to engage the public for promoting the overall BD2K initiative. We are convinced that a community-driven BD2K initiative will best realize its scientific potential and transform the research culture in a sustainable manner, exhibiting lasting success beyond the current funding period.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The challenges of biomedical Big Data are multifaceted. Biomedical investigators face daunting tasks of storing, analyzing, and distributing large-scale omics data, and aggregating all information to discern mechanistic insights. A coherent effort is required to harness disarrayed Big Data and transform them into intelligible scientific facts, whil engaging the global community via education and outreach programs. This Big Data Science Research proposal is designed to address these challenges by formulating a federated architecture of community-supported tools for enhancing data management, integration and analysis.            ",A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform,9087292,U54GM114833,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population Research', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'big biomedical data', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'protein complex', 'protein expression', 'protein metabolite', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'support tools', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U54,2016,133604,0.03906528819463109
"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",9123674,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'data to knowledge', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2016,165886,0.0004982319516755734
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9119811,K23DK101687,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2016,180360,0.003948021771442194
"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor � (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,9070599,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'translational genetics', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2016,169572,-0.017720820833945907
"Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine DESCRIPTION:  As the era of ""Big Data"" is dawning on biomedical research, multiple types of biomedical data, including phenotypic, molecular (including -omics), clinical, imaging, behavioral, and environmental data is being generated on an unprecedented scale with high volume, variety and velocity. These datasets are increasingly large and complex, challenging our current abilities for data representation, integration and analysis for improving outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. It is well-recognized that the greatest challenge to leveraging the significant potentials of Big Data is in educating and recruiting future computational and data scientists who have the background, training and experience to master fundamental opportunities in biomedical sciences. This demands interdisciplinary education and hands-on practicum training on understanding the application, analysis, limitations, and value of the Big Data. To bridge this knowledge gap for the U.S. biomedical workforce, we propose to develop a research educational program-Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine (BDC4CM)-that will instruct students, fellows and scientists in the use of specific new methods and tools fo Big Data by providing tailored, in-depth instruction, hands-on laboratory modules, and case studies on Big Data access, integration, processing and analysis. Offered by highly interdisciplinary and experienced faculty from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota, this program will provide a short- term training opportunity on Big Data methods and approaches for: 1) data and knowledge representation standards; 2) information extraction and natural language processing; 3) visualization analytics; 4) data mining and predictive modeling; 5) privacy and ethics; and 6) applications in comparative effectiveness research and population health research and improvement.

"Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine DESCRIPTION:  As the era of ""Big Data"" is dawning on biomedical research, multiple types of biomedical data, including phenotypic, molecular (including -omics), clinical, imaging, behavioral, and environmental data is being generated on an unprecedented scale with high volume, variety and velocity. These datasets are increasingly large and complex, challenging our current abilities for data representation, integration and analysis for improving outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. It is well-recognized that the greatest challenge to leveraging the significant potentials of Big Data is in educating and recruiting future computational and data scientists who have the background, training and experience to master fundamental opportunities in biomedical sciences. This demands interdisciplinary education and hands-on practicum training on understanding the application, analysis, limitations, and value of the Big Data. To bridge this knowledge gap for the U.S. biomedical workforce, we propose to develop a research educational program-Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine (BDC4CM)-that will instruct students, fellows and scientists in the use of specific new methods and tools fo Big Data by providing tailored, in-depth instruction, hands-on laboratory modules, and case studies on Big Data access, integration, processing and analysis. Offered by highly interdisciplinary and experienced faculty from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota, this program will provide a short- term training opportunity on Big Data methods and approaches for: 1) data and knowledge representation standards; 2) information extraction and natural language processing; 3) visualization analytics; 4) data mining and predictive modeling; 5) privacy and ethics; and 6) applications in comparative effectiveness research and population health research and improvement.

"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9164389,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2016,198612,0.0005640122044605493
"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,9081248,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,404000,-0.027125259127336064

"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing integrated EMR early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early with the intent to ultimately refie the process of care for this group to minimize complication development.",Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data,9147595,K01ES026834,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood coagulation', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Aging', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'care systems', 'career', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'injured', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'professor', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2016,222942,0.04926899550355001
"Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Biomedical science, higher education, software and technology are simultaneously undergoing tectonic shifts. The amazing pace of software and technological development are driving equally amazing advances in the ability to acquire massive data sets in the biomedical sciences. These new Big Biomedical data sets come in the form of complex measurements, such as that of the brain, genome, proteome and human biome or massive databases, such as with electronic health records. Big Data issues, such as reproducibility of processing, measurement and analysis techniques, are increasingly complex, and crucial. Across all domains there is a knowledge gap of researchers to analyze and interpret these new data sets and the current higher education model cannot meet the insatiable demand for this training. We propose to make substantial progress on these issues in two domains. Specifically, we propose to use Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to create two series, one in neuroimaging and one in genomics. These series will allow for flexible, student paced, low cost scalable training for tens of thousands of students. Along with these series, we propose the creation of modular Big Data biostatistical content that can be used by students as well as teachers. This effort will be parallel to work on an intelligent tutoring syste called swirl. This application proposes to use swirl to create rich, gamified learning environments for students. All of the material created from this grant will be open access and free. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Project narrative: We propose two Massive Open Online Course series in neuroimaging and genomic Big Data analysis as well as the creation of modular Big Data statistics content and content creation for an intelligent tutoring system.","Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems",9061684,R25EB020378,"['Adopted', 'Amaze', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Models', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Sets', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Nurses', 'Public Health Nursing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'big biomedical data', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'course module', 'density', 'educational atmosphere', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'higher education', 'instructor', 'learning materials', 'lectures', 'massive open online courses', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'process repeatability', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'tutoring']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R25,2016,209444,0.036183394251858146
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9103879,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2016,401742,-0.0041757189184140325
"Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill Thrombocytopenia is extremely frequent in critically ill patients. However, the role of acute platelet responses in critically ill patients is not well studied, and the multifactorial etiology of thrombocytopenia in the ICU makes it difficult to understand, or understand whether or not to treat it. In several situations such as traumatic injury or sepsis, very low platelet counts have been to bleeding, thrombosis and end-organ injury. Platelets have been extensively studied as a key component of hemostasis, but a rapidly emerging concept is that platelets are also key effector cells in systemic inflammatory processes as both instigators of local and systemic inflammatory reactions and also participants in the inflammation that contributes to tissue injury. The link between platelets and inflammation is complex and bidirectional, as inflammatory ligands have been shown to regulate platelet function and activated platelets induce inflammatory responses in other cell types. The overarching theme of this proposal is to study platelet dynamics in critically ill patients, construct clinical endotypes of thrombocytopenia in this population, and to relate these endotypes to underlying mesoscale mechanisms through computational modeling. We will use a large electronic health record-based database and a tri-state trauma database as source data to construct these endotypes. We define endotype as clinical patterns defined along four dimensions: (1) baseline information (demographic, chronic disease burden, severity of illness and admitting diagnosis), (2) features of the platelet count time series (rate of decrease, nadir, etc.), (3) concurrent interventions, and (4) outcome. The computational approach will attempt to root clinical endotypes in mechanistic interpretations (or collections of alternative interpretations), contributing to focus basic science investiagtions, and to close key knowledge gaps preventing the design and use of targeted anti-platelet-inflammatory therapies in the critically ill. Computational models will be developed at different levels of complexity, with a specific attention to tie underlying mechanisms to functional assays routinely performed in thrombocytopenic patients, such as prothrombin time, activated coagulation time, and thromboelastogram. Platelets is a blood component playing a central role in coagulation and the inflammatory response. A low platelet counts is seen extremely often in acutely ill patients. This proposal will use large databases to find patterns associated with low platelets, how decreasing or low platelet counts are associated with disease and outcome, and use computer model to link the time evolution of platelet counts to mechanisms of disease. Hopefully, the research will lead to more focused therapeutic approaches targeting platelets in critically ill patients.",Endotypes of thrombocytopenia in the critically ill,9168282,R21HL133891,"['Acute', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Factor', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effector Cell', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Formulation', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Platelet Activation', 'Platelet Count measurement', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prothrombin time assay', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sentinel', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Thromboembolism', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Venous', 'attenuation', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'density', 'design', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'prevent', 'response', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2016,217444,0.003097048495025073
"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients. In providing these services, our framework will collect data on the organization trauma care environments, and our framework will make that data available for researchers interested in comparative studies.",Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care,9026622,R01GM111324,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Housing', 'Imagery', 'Impact evaluation', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Systems', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Names', 'Online Systems', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rights', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Assessment', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Violent injury', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'data access', 'design', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'organizational structure', 'prevent', 'public health research', 'tool', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'web services']",NIGMS,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,R01,2016,257217,0.01944132164662546
"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",9145647,U24CA199374,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Professional Organizations', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'drug discovery', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'support tools', 'symposium', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2016,605366,0.01828911238562244
"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio) statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offer and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from four different departments within four different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts, and Information Science in the School of Information. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high-dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and response for our pilot offering in 2015 with 153 applications for 20 positions and a yield rate of 80% from the offers we extended. We plan to build on the success of this initial offering in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2016-2018). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a no-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 30 undergraduates nationally and expose them to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by UM researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a six week long summer institute: ""Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data"" to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 30 undergraduates recruited nationally, from 2016-2018.

"Analytical Approaches to Massive Data Computation with Applications to Genomics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to design and test mathematically well founded algorithmic and statistical tectonics for analyzing large scale, heterogeneous and noisy data. We focus on fully analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and rigorous statistical guarantees on the analysis results. This project will leverage on the PIs' recent work on cancer genomics data analysis and rigorous data mining techniques. Those works were driven by specific applications, while in the current project we aim at developing general principles and techniques that will apply to a broad sets of applications. The proposed research is transformative in its emphasis on rigorous analytical evaluation of algorithms' performance and statistical measures of output uncertainty, in contrast to the primarily heuristic approaches currently used in data ming and machine learning. While we cannot expect full mathematical analysis of all data mining and machine learning techniques, any progress in that direction will have significant contribution to the reliability and scientific impact of this discipline. While ou work is motivated by molecular biology data, we expect the techniques to be useful for other scientific communities with massive multi-variate data analysis challenges. Molecular biology provides an excellent source of data for testing advance data analysis techniques: specifically, DNA/RNA sequence data repositories are growing at a super-exponential rate. The data is typically large and noisy, and it includes both genotype and phenotype features that permit experimental validation of the analysis. One such data repository is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which we will use for initial testing of the proposed approaches. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This project will advocate a responsible approach to data analysis, based on well-founded mathematical and Statistical concepts. Such an approach enhances the effectiveness of evidence based medicine and other policy and social applications of big data analysis.

"Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data DESCRIPTION:  Funding is sought for the Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data (SISBID) at the University of Washington. This program will provide workshops on the statistical and computational skills needed to access, process, manage, and analyze large biomedical data sets. It will be co-directed by Ali Shojaie and Daniela Witten, faculty in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Washington.  The SISBID program will consist of five 2.5-day in-person courses, or modules, taught at the University of Washington each July. An individual participant can register for whichever set of modules he or she chooses. The five modules are as follows: (1) Accessing Biomedical Big Data; (2) Data Visualization; (3) Supervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (4) Unsupervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (5) Reproducible Research for Biomedical Big Data. Each module will consist of a combination of formal lectures and hands-on computing labs. Participants will work together in teams in order to apply the skills that they develop in each module to important problems drawn from relevant case studies.  The primary audience for SISBID will consist of biomedical scientists who would like to develop the statistical and computational training needed to make use of Biomedical Big Data. The secondary audience will consist of individuals with stronger statistical or computational backgrounds but little exposure to biology, who will learn how to apply their skills to problems associated with Biomedical Big Data. Participants will include advanced undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and researchers, and will be drawn from industry, government, and academia. In order to ensure that all participants are able to fully engage in the program, participants will be expected to already have some prior background in R programming and statistical inference, which can be obtained by taking two free online courses before the program begins.  Each of the five modules will be co-taught by two instructors. The ten instructors will be drawn from top universities and research centers across the U.S., such as the University of Washington, Rice University, University of Iowa, Johns Hopkins University, MD Anderson Cancer Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and University of North Carolina.

PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   In recent years, the biomedical sciences have been inundated by Big Data, such as DNA sequence data and electronic medical records. In principle, it should be possible to use such data for a variety of tasks, such as predicting an individual's risk of developing diabetes or cancer, and tailoring therapies to an individual should he or she become ill.

"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates belo 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,8912480,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'design', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2015,583203,-0.021978490766083932
"The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to establish a national short course in Big Data Image Processing & Analysis (BigDIPA) intended to increase the number and overall skills of competent research scientists now encountering large, complex image data sources derived from cutting edge biological/biomedical research approaches. Extraction of knowledge from these imaging sources requires specialized skills and an interdisciplinary mindset. Yet effective training opportunities of this sector of the ""Big Data"" science community are glaringly underappreciated and underserved compared to other big data fields such as omics. UC Irvine is ideally suited to host a short course to address this thematic training deficit on account of the synergistic colocalization between multiple facilities, renowned for development of numerous advanced imaging techniques, and the outstanding instructional environment provided by faculty with collaborative expertise in biological image processing and computer vision, bioinformatics and high performance computational approaches.  Specifically, our BigDIPA proposal assembles an interdisciplinary alliance of faculty experts that can leverage the preeminent imaging resource facilities, such as the Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) and the Beckman Laser Institute, and fuse these to ongoing campus big data initiatives, e.g. UCI's Data Science Initiative, to create a top-rated training course designed for senior graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty and industry scientists from diverse scientific disciplines who have nascent interests and needs to handle BIG DATA sources beyond their current level of competency.  The course theme is focused to utilize discreet examples drawn from the analysis of complex data acquired from different microscopy imaging modalities employed to investigate dynamics in cellular and tissue processes, including signal transduction networks, development, neuroscience and biomedical applications, and that hereto where hidden or inaccessible to standard methods of analysis. Participants will be guided along the complete acquisition- processing-analysis pipeline through exposure to a coherent progression of topics and issues typically encountered when handling BIG DATA. We believe this training approach will therefore be attractive to a broad and significant untapped pool of researchers from the biological disciplines, biomedical engineering, systems biology, math, biophysics, computer science, bioinformatics and statistics who possess some, but not all, of the requisite competencies to effectively traverse the BD2K landscape. We have designed the course such that skills and experience gained by trainees will be transferable to their own research interests.  The BigDIPA course format will combine didactic lectures on the theory and foundational frameworks that underpin each step, with practical instruction on implementation and hands-on tutorials in image acquisition, large data handling, basic scripting of computational tools, image processing on high performance computing architectures, as well as feature extraction, evaluation and visualization of results. The course is designed to offer an intense learning experience delivered in a compact time frame, and opportunities to foster interdisciplinary interactions through small team exercises. Participants will also be encouraged to take advantage of pre-courses - separate and distinct training opportunities not funded by this proposal - that will be coordinated to directly precede our course. This unique format provides multiple benefits: it provides an efficient mechanism to address individual participant training deficiencies to permit a more productive experience in the BigDIPA course, adds no-cost mutual benefits to independent but synergistic programs, and facilitates recruitment of applicants who frequently feel interested but intimidated due to a perceived lack of prior adequate training.  Beyond providing an intensive on-site training course, all course materials (lecture notes, video lectures and tutorials), tutorial exercises, open source software resources and sample datasets will be made freely available through on-line distribution to maximize outreach and encourage additional contributions of curated training resources solicited from the community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to train and expand the cadre of researchers capable of effectively using the deluge of complex BIG DATA being generated by advanced biomedical imaging approaches. These data sources represent a rich source of complex information relevant to many scientific areas of inquiry, and are informative at multiple scales ranging from fundamental biological processes at the cellular level to patient diagnostics for diseases such as cancer or neurological disorders.            ",The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis,9044533,R25EB022366,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'biomedical scientist', 'citizen science', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data format', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'lecture notes', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'open source', 'outreach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tissue processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R25,2015,161997,0.046912017100647393

"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.                ",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9044512,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Family', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'forging', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'model building', 'molecular imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'oncology', 'predictive marker', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,198952,0.01291440236613993
"Developing Cloud-based tools for Big Neural Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Big data has the potential to dramatically advance the electrophysiology biodata sciences in similar ways that it has transformed Genetics. Differences between these two areas dictate separate approaches to apply Big Data tools, and methods in order to provide successful assets to the research community. For one, neural datasets are very heterogeneous by nature. The data is difficult to interpret without knowing specifics about the data acquisition protocol, the experimental paradigm and the physiological state of the recorded subject. Many neural datasets are complemented with complex meta-data sets, which should be an integral component in any effort to integrate and share these data with other researchers. The goal of this project is to develop novel, generalizable Big Data tools to facilitate cloud-base analysis of complex multi-scale neural data. Epilepsy research will be used as a specific use case to guide the development of the tools. A cohort of established senior investigators performing epilepsy research will use and validate these tools in their laboratories. Epilepsy research is currently limited by its narrow focus on single models (animal or human) in individual centers and laboratories. Just as Genetics was revolutionized through Big Data techniques, so too can Epilepsy research be transformed through novel approaches to standardize, share, and mine data across groups of investigators. Over the past several years I have co-developed a NINDS funded cloud-based data platform, ://ieeg.org, giving me a central role in developing Big Data solutions for neural data, such as customized data sharing, large-scale cloud-based data analysis, and search and interrogation techniques for complex data and metadata. My scientific objectives for this project are: (1) to develop generalizable tools to curate, analyze, and interrogate multi-scale neural data, and (2) to create a platform that will galvanize a research community focused on sharing data, and methods to advance Big Data research in the basic and translational neurosciences. Equally important to this proposal, I present a training plan to prepare me for an academic career focused on Big Data in the neurosciences. This plan supplements my background in bioengineering and statistical modeling of neural data with broader data-science expertise in data integration and machine learning, and deeper domain knowledge of the clinical neurosciences. I have assembled a group of collaborators, basic investigators and clinician scientists, who will use the tools developed in this project to analyze and validate their data and methods. I will use the results of this project as the foundation for a R01 Grant application, in which I will expand the developed platform and tools to target other research domains (TBI, Emergency Care, Cardiac), as well as integrate other data-modalities such as Imaging, and Genomics.

"BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's.              n/a",BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: DA: Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictions of Outcomes (C3PO),8840825,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NIGMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2015,529458,-0.014618261809038084
"Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ""Big data"" such as those arising from sequencing, imaging, genomics and other emerging technologies are playing a critical role in modern biology and medicine. The generation of hypotheses about biological processes and disease mechanisms is now increasingly being driven by the production and analysis of large and complex datasets. Advanced computational methods have been developed for the robust analysis of these datasets, and the growth in number and sophistication of these methods has closely tracked the growth in volume and complexity of biomedical data. In such a crowded environment of diverse computational methods and data, it is difficult to judge how generalizable the performance of these methods is from one setting to another. Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have now become popular mechanisms for the rigorous, blinded and unbiased evaluation of the performance of these methods and the identification of best-performing methods for biomedical problems. However, despite the benefits of these challenges to the biomedical research enterprise, the impact of their findings has been remarkably limited in laboratory and clinical settings. This is likely due to two important aspects of current challenges: (i) their over-emphasis on identifying the ""best"" solutions rather than tryig to comprehensively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submitted solutions, and (ii) the absence of a stable channel of communication and collaboration between problem and solution providers due to a lack of sufficient incentives to do so. The aim of this project is to boost the translational impact of scientific challenges through a combination of novel machine learning methods, development of novel scalable software and unique collaborations with disease experts to ensure the effective translation of knowledge accrued in challenges to real clinical settings and practice. These novel methods and software are designed to effectively assimilate the knowledge embedded in all the submissions to challenges into ""ensemble"" solutions. In a first of its kind effort, the ensemble solutions derived from disease-focused challenges under the DREAM project will be brought directly to scientists and clinicians that are experts in these disease areas. Initial effort in this project will focus on active DREAM challenges aiming at the accurate prediction of drug response and clinical outcomes respectively in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Both these diseases are difficult to treat and thus they pose major medical and public health concerns. In collaboration with RA and AML experts, the ensemble solutions learnt in these challenges will be validated in independent patient cohorts and carefully designed clinical studies. This second-level validation is essential to judge the clinical applicability of any method, but is rarely done As the methodology is general, similar efforts will be made for other diseases in later stages of the project. Overall, using a smart combination of crowdsourcing-based challenges and computational methods and software, we aim to demonstrate a unique pathway for studying and treating disease by truly leveraging the ""wisdom of the crowds"".         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Crowdsourcing-based scientific competitions, or challenges, have become a popular mechanism to identify innovative solutions to complex biomedical problems. However, the collective effort of all the challenge participants has been under utilized, and the overall impact on actual clinical and laboratory practice has been remarkably limited. Using novel computational methods and novel ""big data""-friendly software implementation, we plan to demonstrate how biomedical challenges, combined with our approach, can influence clinical practice in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Rheumatoid Arthritis, as well as rigorously validate our approach.                 ",Boosting the Translational Impact of Scientific Competitions by Ensemble Learning,8864679,R01GM114434,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Advanced Development', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blinded', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Incentives', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Production', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Role', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Design', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge translation', 'meetings', 'method development', 'novel', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'stem', 'tool']",NIGMS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2015,445887,0.01465082703672705
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8788442,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2015,129546,-0.018165017216047963
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8929292,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2015,132348,0.018012035741614012
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8935820,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,146944,-0.026207722593500522
"A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inception of the BD2K Initiative is a testament to the foresight of NIH and our community. Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data. Capitalizing on our investigators' complementary strengths in computational biology and cardiovascular medicine, we will present a fusion of cutting-edge innovations that are grounded in a cardiovascular research focus, encompassing: (i) on-the-cloud data processing, (ii) crowd sourcing and text-mining data annotation, (iii) protein spatiotemporal dynamics, (iv) multi-omic integration, and (v) multiscale clinical data modeling. Drawing from our decade of experience in creating and refining bioinformatics tools, we propose to amalgamate established Big Data resources into a generalizable model for data annotation and collaborative research, through a new query system and cloud infrastructure for accessing multiple omics repositories, and through computational-supported crowdsourcing initiatives for mining the biomedical literature. We propose to interweave diverse data types for revealing biological networks that coalesce from molecular entities at multiple scales, through machine learning methods for structuring molecular data and defining relationships with drugs and diseases, and through novel algorithms for on-the-cloud integration and pathway visualization of multi-dimensional molecular data. Moreover, we propose to innovate advanced modeling tools to resolve protein dynamics and spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms, through mechanistic modeling of protein properties and 3D protein expression maps, and through Bayesian algorithms that correlate patient phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles. The utility and customizability o our tools to the broader research population is clearly demonstrated using three archetypical workflows that enable annotations of large lists of genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites; powerful analysis of complex protein datasets acquired over time; and seamless aQoregation of diverse molecular, textual and literature data.

"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology.

"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",8922958,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'CNR2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'traumatic event', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2015,166237,0.0004982319516755734
"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor � (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8852606,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2015,169572,-0.017720820833945907
"Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine DESCRIPTION:  As the era of ""Big Data"" is dawning on biomedical research, multiple types of biomedical data, including phenotypic, molecular (including -omics), clinical, imaging, behavioral, and environmental data is being generated on an unprecedented scale with high volume, variety and velocity. These datasets are increasingly large and complex, challenging our current abilities for data representation, integration and analysis for improving outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. It is well-recognized that the greatest challenge to leveraging the significant potentials of Big Data is in educating and recruiting future computational and data scientists who have the background, training and experience to master fundamental opportunities in biomedical sciences. This demands interdisciplinary education and hands-on practicum training on understanding the application, analysis, limitations, and value of the Big Data. To bridge this knowledge gap for the U.S. biomedical workforce, we propose to develop a research educational program-Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine (BDC4CM)-that will instruct students, fellows and scientists in the use of specific new methods and tools fo Big Data by providing tailored, in-depth instruction, hands-on laboratory modules, and case studies on Big Data access, integration, processing and analysis. Offered by highly interdisciplinary and experienced faculty from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota, this program will provide a short- term training opportunity on Big Data methods and approaches for: 1) data and knowledge representation standards; 2) information extraction and natural language processing; 3) visualization analytics; 4) data mining and predictive modeling; 5) privacy and ethics; and 6) applications in comparative effectiveness research and population health research and improvement. Our primary educational goal is to prepare the next generation of innovators and visionaries in the emerging, multidimensional field of Big Data Science in healthcare, as well as to develop a future workforce that fulfills industry needs and increases U.S. competitiveness in healthcare technologies and applications.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs. Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation. Rigorous human factor engineering principles and techniques will be adopted in developing this system and we will further leverage this real-time alerting system to investigate the principal physiological abnormalities that are associated with accurate ICP elevation.",ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform,8789794,R01NS076738,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intensive Care', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Plumbing', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'interest', 'model building', 'open source', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'usability']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2015,442019,0.014508036718816794
"Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Biomedical science, higher education, software and technology are simultaneously undergoing tectonic shifts. The amazing pace of software and technological development are driving equally amazing advances in the ability to acquire massive data sets in the biomedical sciences. These new Big Biomedical data sets come in the form of complex measurements, such as that of the brain, genome, proteome and human biome or massive databases, such as with electronic health records. Big Data issues, such as reproducibility of processing, measurement and analysis techniques, are increasingly complex, and crucial. Across all domains there is a knowledge gap of researchers to analyze and interpret these new data sets and the current higher education model cannot meet the insatiable demand for this training. We propose to make substantial progress on these issues in two domains. Specifically, we propose to use Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to create two series, one in neuroimaging and one in genomics. These series will allow for flexible, student paced, low cost scalable training for tens of thousands of students. Along with these series, we propose the creation of modular Big Data biostatistical content that can be used by students as well as teachers. This effort will be parallel to work on an intelligent tutoring syste called swirl. This application proposes to use swirl to create rich, gamified learning environments for students. All of the material created from this grant will be open access and free.

"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,8915740,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,397940,-0.027125259127336064
"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing integrated EMR early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early with the intent to ultimately refie the process of care for this group to minimize complication development.                ",Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data,9043721,K01ES026834,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood coagulation', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Aging', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'care systems', 'career', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'injured', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2015,222898,0.04926899550355001
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,8935802,U54EB020405,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2015,401742,-0.0041757189184140325
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization Genomic data is big and getting ever bigger, but current analysis methods will not scale to the analysis of thousands or millions of genomes. Consequently, a critical technical challenge is to develop new methods that can analyze these enormous data sets. In this proposal, we describe a new computational framework for drawing inferences from massive genomic data sets. Our approach leverages submodular summarization methods that have been developed for analyzing text corpora. We will apply these methods to five big data problems in genomics: 1) identifying functional elements characteristic o f a given human cell type; 2) identifying genomic features associated with a particular subclass of cancer; 3-4) identifying genomic variants representative of ancestrally or phenotypically defined human populations; and 5) finding a set of microbial genes that characterize a given site on the human body. This project will advance discovery and understanding on two fronts. First, we will develop novel methods for summarizing genomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data sets. Indeed, to our knowledge, this grant proposes the first application of summarization methods to genomic data of any kind. The proposed research will significantly advance our ability to apply submodularity to these summarization tasks, particularly with respect to identifying and creating a library of distance functions that have bee validated with respect to the five tasks outlined in the proposal. Second, we will apply our novel methods to problems of profound importance. Indeed, significant progress toward any one of our five tasks would represent an important advance in our scientific understanding of human history, biology or disease. The impact of this project will grow as the big data problem grows, even after the project is complete. The results of this project, both the software that we develop and the summaries that we produce, will be useful for answering a wide array of questions in any field that must cope with big data. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to an explosion of genomic data. This data contains valuable knowledge about human biology and human disease, but few existing computational methods are designed to scale to the joint analysis of tens of thousands of human genomes. This proposal adapts and extends recent advances from the field of natural language processing to characterize cancer subtvoesdiscover ofinetic variants associated with disease and characterize human microbial populations.",BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization,8840551,R01CA180777,"['Bees', 'Big Data', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Explosion', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Human body', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Population', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Variant', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'coping', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'genetic variant', 'human disease', 'microbial', 'novel', 'software development']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,219004,-0.004032285089535548
"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8897359,K23DK090304,"['Academy', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,37402,0.019484170439912414
"Comparative Assessment Framework for Environments of Trauma Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop a semantically driven, web-based IT framework that will (a) allow comparison of organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems and (b) collect data about the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems. Our first goal is to enable representatives of trauma care environments and verification/consultation bodies to use our framework for computer-assisted assessment of trauma care organizations. Our second goal is to support public health researchers by providing them access to the knowledge accumulated through verification and consultation processes. Currently, little is known about which structures and processes of trauma systems and trauma centers lead to optimal care for the injured patient, yet the role of structure in influencing performance has been widely recognized in the healthcare industry. One reason for this gap in knowledge is that, despite a strong regulatory framework, we lack unified, machine- interpretable models of the organization of trauma centers and trauma systems to foster comparability between different instances of each type of organization. Our proposed web services will be based on such a machine- interpretable model, which we propose to develop as an ontology of trauma center and trauma system organization under Aim 1. Within the domain of biomedicine, issues related to comparability have already been successfully addressed with ontologies-logical models of the components of a domain and their interrelations that are coded in a machine-interpretable language. Under Aim 2 we will develop the technical means to integrate the ontology in a web service infrastructure. Aim 3 is to create the infrastructure to be used by those seeking and those providing trauma care assessment and to enable comparison of organizational structures of trauma care environments. In the process of comparing organizational structures of trauma centers and trauma systems, data will be collected from the user and stored in our data repository. Thus, while running the service, we will also be creating a data source about organization of trauma centers and trauma systems, which we will make available to those conducting comparative research on the impact of organizational structures of trauma care facilities on patient outcomes under Aim 4. The interrelation between organizational structures and patient outcome is known in the public health literature, but we lack tools to explore its effects on trauma care environments in a computer-assisted manner; our project will provide an IT framework resolving this lack. It will contribute to information and knowledge processing, advanced information retrieval, and incorporation of machine intelligence into decision processes. By providing a common schema, it will also contribute to the integration of heterogeneous data types. Our project will impact the work of organizations that assess, verify, or designate trauma care environments, as well as organizations interested in self-assessing their own organization. Supporting comparison of these organizations will not only affect assessment or certification but also add to the comparability of patient outcome data by linking it to specific organizational components.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We will develop an IT framework accessible on the Internet that facilitates and optimizes verification of trauma centers and consultation of trauma systems and fosters comparability between trauma care environments with different organizational structures and under different legislations. Making these structures more comparable will not only benefit those who provide verification or consultation to trauma care environments, it will also allow organizations unable to acquire assessment through third parties to do in-house assessments based on data collected through best-practice assessments for the benefits of the patients.

"Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the advent of whole slide digital scanners, histopathology slides can be digitized into very high-resolution digital images, realizing a new ""big data"" stream that can potentially rival ""omics data"" in size and complexity. Just as with the analysis of high-throughput genetic and expression data, the application of sophisticated image analytic tools and data pipelines can render the often passive data of digital pathology (DP) archives into a powerful source for: (a) rich quantitative insights into cancer biology and (b) companion diagnostic decision support tools for precision medicine. Digital pathology enabled companion diagnostic tests could yield predictions of cancer risk and aggressiveness in a manner similar to molecular diagnostic tests. However, prior to widespread clinical adoption of DP, extensive evaluation of clinical interpretation of DP imaging (DPI) and accompanying decision support tools needs to be undertaken. Wider acceptance of DPI by the cancer community (clinical and research) is hampered by lack of a publicly available, open access image informatics platform for easily viewing, managing, and quantitatively analyzing DPIs. While some commercial platforms exist for viewing and analyzing DPI data, none of these platforms are freely available. Open source image viewing/management platforms that cater to the radiology (e.g. XNAT) and computational biology communities are typically not conducive to handling very large file sizes as encountered with DPI datasets.  This multi-PI U24 proposal seeks to expand on an existing, freely available pathology image viewer (Sedeen Image Viewer) to create a pathology informatics platform (PIIP) for managing, annotating, sharing, and quantitatively analyzing DPI data. Sedeen was designed as a universal platform for DPI (by addressing several proprietary scanner formats and ""big data"" challenges), to provide (1) reliable and useful image annotation tools, and (2) for image registration and analysis of DPI data. Additionally, Sedeen has become an application for cropping large DPIs so that they can be input into programs such as Matlab or ImageJ. Sedeen has been freely available to the public for three years, with over 160 unique users from over 20 countries.  Building on the initial successes of Sedeen and its existing user base, our intent is to massively increase dissemination of DPI and algorithms in the cancer research community and clinical trial efforts, as well as to contribute towards the adoption of a rational and standardized set of DP operational conventions. This unique project will allow end users with different needs and technical backgrounds to seamlessly (a) archive and manage, (b) share, and (c) visualize their DPI data, acquired from different sites, formats, and platforms. The PIIP will provide a unified user interface for third party algorithms (nuclear segmentation, color normalization, biomarker quantification, radiology-pathology fusion) and will allow for algorithmic evaluation upon data arising from a plurality of source sites. By partnering with professional societies, we envision that the PIIP user base will expand to include the oncology, pathology, radiology, and pharmaceutical communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This grant will result in the further development of advanced functionality of the already existing digital pathology image informatics platform (PIIP) with an established user-base for cancer research. Such an enhanced platform will provide the much-needed foundation for advancing (a) routine clinical adoption of digital pathology for primary diagnosis and (b) training and validation of companion diagnostic decision support systems based off histopathology. Thus, the project is aligned with the NCI's goal to foster innovative research strategies and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving human health.                ","Pathology Image Informatics Platform for visualization, analysis and management",8970326,U24CA199374,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Community Clinical Oncology Program', 'Community Trial', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'International', 'Language', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Students', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Ontology', 'Optics', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'clinical research site', 'companion diagnostics', 'computer human interaction', 'data exchange', 'data integration', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high throughput analysis', 'image archival system', 'image registration', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'oncology', 'open source', 'photonics', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'research clinical testing', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user friendly software', 'validation studies']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U24,2015,606305,0.01828911238562244

This program will provide workshops on the statistical and computational skills needed to access, process, manage, and analyze large biomedical data sets. It will be co-directed by Ali Shojaie and Daniela Witten, faculty in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Washington.  The SISBID program will consist of five 2.5-day in-person courses, or modules, taught at the University of Washington each July. An individual participant can register for whichever set of modules he or she chooses. The five modules are as follows: (1) Accessing Biomedical Big Data; (2) Data Visualization; (3) Supervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (4) Unsupervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (5) Reproducible Research for Biomedical Big Data. Each module will consist of a combination of formal lectures and hands-on computing labs. Participants will work together in teams in order to apply the skills that they develop in each module to important problems drawn from relevant case studies.  The primary audience for SISBID will consist of biomedical scientists who would like to develop the statistical and computational training needed to make use of Biomedical Big Data. The secondary audience will consist of individuals with stronger statistical or computational backgrounds but little exposure to biology, who will learn how to apply their skills to problems associated with Biomedical Big Data. Participants will include advanced undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and researchers, and will be drawn from industry, government, and academia. In order to ensure that all participants are able to fully engage in the program, participants will be expected to already have some prior background in R programming and statistical inference, which can be obtained by taking two free online courses before the program begins.

"Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams  PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our previous studies provide support that such deviations indicate clinically important events at false alert rates below 50%, which is very promising. We propose to further improve the new methodology, and build a real-time monitoring and alerting system integrated with production electronic medical records. We propose an evaluation of the system using physicians' assessment of alerts raised by our real-time system for intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in the intensive care unit (ICU). This project develops and evaluates a new clinical monitoring and alerting framework that uses electronic medical records and machine-learning methods to send alerts concerning clinical decisions in the ICU that are unexpected given the clinical context and may represent medical errors.                ",Real-time detection of deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams,8641014,R01GM088224,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electronics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Information Systems', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Production', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'design', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'liver transplantation', 'multidisciplinary', 'prototype', 'public health relevance']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2014,580180,-0.021978490766083932

"Developing Cloud-based tools for Big Neural Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Big data has the potential to dramatically advance the electrophysiology biodata sciences in similar ways that it has transformed Genetics. Differences between these two areas dictate separate approaches to apply Big Data tools, and methods in order to provide successful assets to the research community. For one, neural datasets are very heterogeneous by nature. The data is difficult to interpret without knowing specifics about the data acquisition protocol, the experimental paradigm and the physiological state of the recorded subject. Many neural datasets are complemented with complex meta-data sets, which should be an integral component in any effort to integrate and share these data with other researchers. The goal of this project is to develop novel, generalizable Big Data tools to facilitate cloud-base analysis of complex multi-scale neural data. Epilepsy research will be used as a specific use case to guide the development of the tools. A cohort of established senior investigators performing epilepsy research will use and validate these tools in their laboratories. Epilepsy research is currently limited by its narrow focus on single models (animal or human) in individual centers and laboratories. Just as Genetics was revolutionized through Big Data techniques, so too can Epilepsy research be transformed through novel approaches to standardize, share, and mine data across groups of investigators. Over the past several years I have co-developed a NINDS funded cloud-based data platform, ://ieeg.org, giving me a central role in developing Big Data solutions for neural data, such as customized data sharing, large-scale cloud-based data analysis, and search and interrogation techniques for complex data and metadata. My scientific objectives for this project are: (1) to develop generalizable tools to curate, analyze, and interrogate multi-scale neural data, and (2) to create a platform that will galvanize a research community focused on sharing data, and methods to advance Big Data research in the basic and translational neurosciences. Equally important to this proposal, I present a training plan to prepare me for an academic career focused on Big Data in the neurosciences. This plan supplements my background in bioengineering and statistical modeling of neural data with broader data-science expertise in data integration and machine learning, and deeper domain knowledge of the clinical neurosciences. I have assembled a group of collaborators, basic investigators and clinician scientists, who will use the tools developed in this project to analyze and validate their data and methods. I will use the results of this project as the foundation for a R01 Grant application, in which I will expand the developed platform and tools to target other research domains (TBI, Emergency Care, Cardiac), as well as integrate other data-modalities such as Imaging, and Genomics.

"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications.              PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8700987,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2014,132121,0.018012035741614012
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.            ",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8617518,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2014,129546,-0.018165017216047963
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.            ",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8830000,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2014,151804,-0.026207722593500522
"A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inception of the BD2K Initiative is a testament to the foresight of NIH and our community. Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data. Capitalizing on our investigators' complementary strengths in computational biology and cardiovascular medicine, we will present a fusion of cutting-edge innovations that are grounded in a cardiovascular research focus, encompassing: (i) on-the-cloud data processing, (ii) crowd sourcing and text-mining data annotation, (iii) protein spatiotemporal dynamics, (iv) multi-omic integration, and (v) multiscale clinical data modeling. Drawing from our decade of experience in creating and refining bioinformatics tools, we propose to amalgamate established Big Data resources into a generalizable model for data annotation and collaborative research, through a new query system and cloud infrastructure for accessing multiple omics repositories, and through computational-supported crowdsourcing initiatives for mining the biomedical literature. We propose to interweave diverse data types for revealing biological networks that coalesce from molecular entities at multiple scales, through machine learning methods for structuring molecular data and defining relationships with drugs and diseases, and through novel algorithms for on-the-cloud integration and pathway visualization of multi-dimensional molecular data. Moreover, we propose to innovate advanced modeling tools to resolve protein dynamics and spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms, through mechanistic modeling of protein properties and 3D protein expression maps, and through Bayesian algorithms that correlate patient phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles. The utility and customizability o our tools to the broader research population is clearly demonstrated using three archetypical workflows that enable annotations of large lists of genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites; powerful analysis of complex protein datasets acquired over time; and seamless aQoregation of diverse molecular, textual and literature data. These workflows will be rigorously validated using data from two significant clinical cohorts, the Jackson Heart Study and the Healthy Elderly Longevity (Wellderly). In parallel, a multifaceted strategy will be implemented to educate and train biomedical investigators, and to engage the public for promoting the overall BD2K initiative. We are convinced that a community-driven BD2K initiative will best realize its scientific potential and transform the research culture in a sustainable manner, exhibiting lasting success beyond the current funding period.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The challenges of biomedical Big Data are multifaceted. Biomedical investigators face daunting tasks of storing, analyzing, and distributing large-scale omics data, and aggregating all information to discern mechanistic insights. A coherent effort is required to harness disarrayed Big Data and transform them into intelligible scientific facts, whil engaging the global community via education and outreach programs.

"Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of my proposed K01 application is to receive training and conduct research that will lead to the development of a new methodology for the early identification of posttraumatic stress outcomes. This proposal capitalizes on my previous research to identify empirically derived outcomes of posttraumatic stress and resilience that are agnostic to DSM-based diagnostic criteria. This work has identified a limited number of common patterns of response including resilience, slow recovery, and chronic posttraumatic stress. Further, the proposal capitalizes on training I have received in the neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder. My training throughout the K01 will focus on learning a new set of modeling techniques (Machine Learning) that will allow me to predict an individual's likely course following trauma exposure based on neuroendocrine abnormalities and cognitive and emotional characteristics in the acute phase, genetic polymorphisms, and demographic characteristics. Further, my training will focus on greatly increasing my theoretical understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of symptom responses, as well as alterations in cognition and emotion in response to stress and traumatic stress, providing the theoretical basis for the predictive models. I have selected mentors, sponsors, and advisors who have the specific backgrounds and knowledge to aid me in achieving these goals and with whom I am currently collaborating on preliminary research in this area. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop new methods for the early identification of individuals in need of therapeutic intervention following trauma exposure. A second but equally important goal is the identification of new treatment targets based on abnormal characteristics that present early on in individuals who will later develop long-term posttraumatic stress outcomes. This K01 proposal is ambitious, but it is also feasible thanks to the intellectual support of my proposed mentors, sponsors, and advisors along with considerable financial and resource support from the NYU Department of Psychiatry. The combined research and training plan will provide me with skills, theoretical knowledge, and data to launch a focused independent career that fills an important public health gap. Currently, there are not suitable methods to identify individuals in need of treatment early on following trauma or methods for identifying individuals specific treatment needs. While this K01 proposal will not achieve these aims directly, it will provide me with the necessary skills to make a significant contribution in this area over the long term.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of the proposed research and training plan is to develop innovative methods for the early identification of posttraumatic stress responses and resilience based on putative cognitive, emotional, and biological characteristics that differentiat healthy from maladaptive responses to trauma. This effort can lead to the early identification of individuals in need of clinical services and the identification of underlying dimensions of dysfunction that can become new treatment targets for alleviating the disease burden of PTSD. This effort has significant public health implications, as it can lead to new treatment targets and result in the accurate allocation of treatment resources to those most in need.            ","Application of Cognitive, Emotional and Biological Dimensions  - Resubmission - 1",8767056,K01MH102415,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Analgesics', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Area', 'Biologic Characteristic', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Corticotropin', 'DRD2 gene', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Disasters', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'New York City', 'Norepinephrine', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathology', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social support', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'demographics', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'functional disability', 'genetic analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'pediatric trauma', 'post-traumatic stress', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'resilience', 'response', 'sexual assault', 'skills', 'social', 'stress resilience', 'urinary']",NIMH,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,K01,2014,167317,0.0004982319516755734
"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                  ",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8676787,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2014,169572,-0.017720820833945907
"Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine     DESCRIPTION:  As the era of ""Big Data"" is dawning on biomedical research, multiple types of biomedical data, including phenotypic, molecular (including -omics), clinical, imaging, behavioral, and environmental data is being generated on an unprecedented scale with high volume, variety and velocity. These datasets are increasingly large and complex, challenging our current abilities for data representation, integration and analysis for improving outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. It is well-recognized that the greatest challenge to leveraging the significant potentials of Big Data is in educating and recruiting future computational and data scientists who have the background, training and experience to master fundamental opportunities in biomedical sciences. This demands interdisciplinary education and hands-on practicum training on understanding the application, analysis, limitations, and value of the Big Data. To bridge this knowledge gap for the U.S. biomedical workforce, we propose to develop a research educational program-Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine (BDC4CM)-that will instruct students, fellows and scientists in the use of specific new methods and tools fo Big Data by providing tailored, in-depth instruction, hands-on laboratory modules, and case studies on Big Data access, integration, processing and analysis. Offered by highly interdisciplinary and experienced faculty from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota, this program will provide a short- term training opportunity on Big Data methods and approaches for: 1) data and knowledge representation standards; 2) information extraction and natural language processing; 3) visualization analytics; 4) data mining and predictive modeling; 5) privacy and ethics; and 6) applications in comparative effectiveness research and population health research and improvement.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs. Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation. Rigorous human factor engineering principles and techniques will be adopted in developing this system and we will further leverage this real-time alerting system to investigate the principal physiological abnormalities that are associated with accurate ICP elevation.",ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform,8732711,R01NS076738,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Intensive Care', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Plumbing', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rest', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'open source', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'usability']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2014,435641,0.014508036718816794
"Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Biomedical science, higher education, software and technology are simultaneously undergoing tectonic shifts. The amazing pace of software and technological development are driving equally amazing advances in the ability to acquire massive data sets in the biomedical sciences. These new Big Biomedical data sets come in the form of complex measurements, such as that of the brain, genome, proteome and human biome or massive databases, such as with electronic health records. Big Data issues, such as reproducibility of processing, measurement and analysis techniques, are increasingly complex, and crucial. Across all domains there is a knowledge gap of researchers to analyze and interpret these new data sets and the current higher education model cannot meet the insatiable demand for this training. We propose to make substantial progress on these issues in two domains. Specifically, we propose to use Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to create two series, one in neuroimaging and one in genomics. These series will allow for flexible, student paced, low cost scalable training for tens of thousands of students. Along with these series, we propose the creation of modular Big Data biostatistical content that can be used by students as well as teachers. This effort will be parallel to work on an intelligent tutoring syste called swirl. This application proposes to use swirl to create rich, gamified learning environments for students. All of the material created from this grant will be open access and free.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Project narrative: We propose two Massive Open Online Course series in neuroimaging and genomic Big Data analysis as well as the creation of modular Big Data statistics content and content creation for an intelligent tutoring system.            ","Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems",8829370,R25EB020378,"['Adopted', 'Amaze', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Models', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Nurses', 'Public Health Nursing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'cost', 'density', 'flexibility', 'instructor', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'process repeatability', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R25,2014,216000,0.036183394251858146
"Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Clinical care and large observational studies are characterized by periods of intense health monitoring during hospital visits followed by long periods of low-intensity or no-monitoring between visits. Data obtained during in-hospital visits come from a host of new technologies, such as very densely sampled biosignal recordings (EEG, ECG, health scores) and high resolution multi-modality imaging (MRI, CT, PET). A major characteristic of this type of data is that it is collected for a period of time that is subject-spcific. Indeed, the in-hospital length and amount of monitoring varies between subjects, and is highly informative both for studying health outcomes in the hospital and after discharge. One among many examples is a recent study of subjects admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). For each subject the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, a commonly- used scoring system to measure organ dysfunction in the ICU, was collected daily for each subject for the duration of their ICU stay. The ICU length of stay is different by subject and likely to be highly informative of current and future health outcomes. In this application, a set of relevant problems are conceptualized and distilled to statistical aims to address specific complexities associated with this type of data sampling. Specifically, the proposal addresses the following fundamental unsolved problems in studies that collect high density biosignals: 1) introducing statistical models for the association between high density biosignals with uneven support and health outcomes; 2) developing functional registration-by-prediction models that transform the support of biosignals to provide best prediction of health outcomes; and 3) developing models for describing the cross-sectional and longitudinal variability of biosignals obtained in studies with rare -but intense- health monitorin. While focus lies on research studies that collect quasi- continuous ultra-high resolution biosignals for subject-specific lengths of time, methods will be generalizable to many other studies with similar data sampling structures. 2         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project provides analytic methods for biological and health signals that are measured often for unequal periods of time (e.g. disease severity scores during hospital stays, EEG data during sleep, reaching hand movement after stroke). Special emphasis is given to the study of the association between these biosignals and health outcomes. 4                ",Statistical methods for biosignals with varying domains,8742367,R01HL123407,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Applications Grants', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Observational Study', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Visit', 'Width', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical care', 'density', 'experience', 'hazard', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'kinematics', 'member', 'new technology', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'statistics', 'ultra high resolution']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,419500,-0.027125259127336064
"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics.

"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,8775015,U54EB020405,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2014,209258,-0.0041757189184140325
"An Integrative Bioinformatics Approach to Study Single Cancer Cell Heterogeneity     DESCRIPTION:  My long term career goal is to become a leading expert in translational bioinformatics who creates, develops and applies computational and statistical methods to reveal landscapes of cancers and to identify strategies to cure cancers. Human cancers are highly heterogeneous. Such heterogeneity is the major source of the ultimate failure of most cancer agents. However, due to the limit of technologies, the intercellular heterogeneity has not been investigated genome wide, at single-cell level until recently. New technologies such as single-cell transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) and exome have revealed new insights and more profound complexity than was previously thought. However, so far these technologies are limited to one assay per cell. It remains a grand challenge to perform multiple, integrative assays from the same single tumor cell, in particular, from those derived from small tumor biopsies. Given the stochasticity at the single cell resolution, reproducibility and sensitivity ar daunting tasks. To overcome this challenge, I have started the single cancer cell sequencing analysis project, in collaboration with Dr. Sherman Weissman at Yale University, who is also my co-mentor of this K01 proposal. My immediate career goal is to identify genome-wide heterogeneity among single cancer cells, using the erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Towards this, I am proposing a research project on an integrative bioinformatics approach to analyze multiple types of genomics data generated from the same single leukemia cells, a timely and critical topic. Specifically, I am interested in studying the following specific aims: (1) buildinga bioinformatics pipeline to study heterogeneity of single-cell RNA-Seq, (2) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study CpG methylome of single cells, (3) building a bioinformatics pipeline to study single-cell Exome-Seq, and (4) integrate the RNA-Seq, methylome and Exome-Seq data generated from the same single cells. These single cells genomic data are provided by Dr. Sherman Weissman's lab from 30 single K562 erythroleukemia cells. I will first construct and validate in parallel, the RNA-Seq, methylome, and Exome-Seq bioinformatics pipelines optimized for single-cell analysis, and then develop and validate an integrative platform to analyze these multiple types of high-throughput data. To accomplish the research project, and to successfully transit from a junior faculty to an expert of the field, I have developed a career plan with my mentoring committee composed of four world-class experts in different fields relevant to Big Data Science: Primary Mentor Dr. Jason Moore in Bioinformatics from Dartmouth College, Co-mentor Dr. Sherman Weissman in Single-cell Genomics and Genetics from Yale University, Co-mentor Dr. Herbert Yu in Cancer Epidemiology from University of Hawaii Cancer Center and Co-mentor Dr. Jason Leigh in Big Data Visualization from the Information and Computer Science Department of University of Hawaii Manoa. I will primarily work with my four co-mentors for planning the development of my career during this award.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this K01 proposal is to integrate multiple types of high-throughput data, in particular, the transcriptome, exome-sequencing and CpG methylome data generated from single cancer cells. The proposed project is designed to address the urgent need for an integrative bioinformatics platform for mega-data generated from next-generation sequencing applications.

"BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization Genomic data is big and getting ever bigger, but current analysis methods will not scale to the analysis of thousands or millions of genomes. Consequently, a critical technical challenge is to develop new methods that can analyze these enormous data sets. In this proposal, we describe a new computational framework for drawing inferences from massive genomic data sets. Our approach leverages submodular summarization methods that have been developed for analyzing text corpora. We will apply these methods to five big data problems in genomics: 1) identifying functional elements characteristic o f a given human cell type; 2) identifying genomic features associated with a particular subclass of cancer; 3-4) identifying genomic variants representative of ancestrally or phenotypically defined human populations; and 5) finding a set of microbial genes that characterize a given site on the human body. This project will advance discovery and understanding on two fronts. First, we will develop novel methods for summarizing genomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data sets. Indeed, to our knowledge, this grant proposes the first application of summarization methods to genomic data of any kind. The proposed research will significantly advance our ability to apply submodularity to these summarization tasks, particularly with respect to identifying and creating a library of distance functions that have bee validated with respect to the five tasks outlined in the proposal. Second, we will apply our novel methods to problems of profound importance. Indeed, significant progress toward any one of our five tasks would represent an important advance in our scientific understanding of human history, biology or disease. The impact of this project will grow as the big data problem grows, even after the project is complete. The results of this project, both the software that we develop and the summaries that we produce, will be useful for answering a wide array of questions in any field that must cope with big data. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to an explosion of genomic data. This data contains valuable knowledge about human biology and human disease, but few existing computational methods are designed to scale to the joint analysis of tens of thousands of human genomes.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8730137,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,172287,0.019484170439912414
"Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): An unsolved problem in health informatics is how to apply the past experiences of patients, stored in large-scale medical records systems, to predict the outcomes of patients and to individualize care. One approach to prediction, heretofore impractical, is rapidly finding a patient cohort ""similar enough"" to an index case that the health experiences and outcomes of this cohort are informative for prediction. This task is formidable because of large variability of the vast numbers of patient attributes with the added complexity of sequences of patient encounters evolving over time. Epidemiological considerations such as confounding by indication for treatment also come into play. The objective of this research effort is to (1) create a modular test bed that uses a ""big data"" systems architecture to support research in rapid individualized prediction of outcomes from large clinical repositories and (2) to  explore various approaches to making ""pragmatic"" near-term predictions of outcomes. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Informatics and Computing Infrastructure database (VINCI), a research database with records of tens of millions of patients, we will explore two synergistic strategies for rapidly finding a cohort of patients that are similar enough to an index  patient to predict near-term treatment response and/or adverse effects in an elastic cloud environment: 1) use of temporal alignment of critical events including use of gene sequence alignment methods to relax requirements for exact temporal matching; and, 2) use of conceptual distance metrics to model the degree of content similarity of case records. The initial domain of application will be treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The approach will apply open source ""big data"" methodologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo, to store and filter ""medical log"" files. The content of these ""logs"" will be processed by a combination with strategies including conceptual markup of events using natural language processing tools, matching of event streams, and statistical data mining methods to rapidly retrieve and identify patients that are sufficiently similar to an index case to be able to make personalized yet pragmatic clinical predictions of outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This proposal studies how to use experience of past patients, stored in electronic medical records systems, to help clinicians make practical decisions on the care of complex patients with type 1 diabetes. Research applies methods adapted from Internet search engines and from studies of the human genome to determine what it means for one patient's disease experiences to be similar to and relevant to another's. n/a",Techniques to Integrate Disparate Data: Clinical Personalized Pragmatic Predictio,8599828,R01GM108346,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse effects', 'Algorithms', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Budgets', 'Caring', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Child health care', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Human Development', 'Human Genome', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Triage', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'Visualization software', 'Vocabulary', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer type', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data mining', 'design', 'emergency service responder', 'experience', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interoperability', 'medical information system', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel processing', 'performance tests', 'processing speed', 'repository', 'research study', 'response', 'sugar', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2013,568249,-0.014618261809038084
"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                  ",Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD,8545840,K23DK097142,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'CD14 gene', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Research', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genetics', 'IL1R1 gene', 'Immune response', 'Immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health Schools', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Structure', 'TNF gene', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'immune function', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient registry', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'response', 'skills', 'tool development', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2013,168632,-0.017720820833945907
"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation. Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs. Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation.

"Next generation risk variant discovery in a highly penetrant OCD subtype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed five-year K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award outlines a program of career development and research activities that will assist the principal investigator to transition to an independent research career and prepare her to tackle the challenges ahead in unraveling the genetic basis of complex psychiatric phenotypes. The innovative research plan details an approach to mapping risk for a strongly genetic subtype of obsessive compulsive (OCD) and comorbid tic disorders by generating and analyzing whole-exome sequence in select families to identify risk alleles. These efforts will be guided by pilot identity-by-descent, homozygosity, and copy number variant data in the comprehensively phenotyped OCD Collaborative Genetic Study (OCGS) multiplex family dataset. The OCD+tic phenotype is an ideal complex disorder for next generation genetic mapping. The clear phenotype, possibly reduced heterogeneity, and strong genetic effects make it an excellent candidate for the application of methodologies recently proven successful in Mendelian disorders. While the principle investigator has a strong background in child psychiatry and molecular genetics, the knowledge and skills required to master emerging genetic technologies such as next generation sequencing (NGS) are novel and complex. The short-term goals of this application are to gain proficiency in the methods that will drive the field over the coming decades, learn the statistical, computational, and informatics tools that will support this research, continue to develop skills in study design and interpretation, and refine and incorporate clinical and phenotyping skills. A program of coursework, supervision, and hands-on application of these approaches will equip the applicant in the long-term to integrate molecular, computational, and phenotypic data to make meaningful contributions to the field of psychiatric genetics.

"BIGDATA: DA: Interpreting massive genomic data sets via summarization Genomic data is big and getting ever bigger, but current analysis methods will not scale to the analysis of thousands or millions of genomes. Consequently, a critical technical challenge is to develop new methods that can analyze these enormous data sets. In this proposal, we describe a new computational framework for drawing inferences from massive genomic data sets. Our approach leverages submodular summarization methods that have been developed for analyzing text corpora. We will apply these methods to five big data problems in genomics: 1) identifying functional elements characteristic o f a given human cell type; 2) identifying genomic features associated with a particular subclass of cancer; 3-4) identifying genomic variants representative of ancestrally or phenotypically defined human populations; and 5) finding a set of microbial genes that characterize a given site on the human body. This project will advance discovery and understanding on two fronts. First, we will develop novel methods for summarizing genomic, epigenomic and metagenomic data sets. Indeed, to our knowledge, this grant proposes the first application of summarization methods to genomic data of any kind. The proposed research will significantly advance our ability to apply submodularity to these summarization tasks, particularly with respect to identifying and creating a library of distance functions that have bee validated with respect to the five tasks outlined in the proposal. Second, we will apply our novel methods to problems of profound importance. Indeed, significant progress toward any one of our five tasks would represent an important advance in our scientific understanding of human history, biology or disease. The impact of this project will grow as the big data problem grows, even after the project is complete. The results of this project, both the software that we develop and the summaries that we produce, will be useful for answering a wide array of questions in any field that must cope with big data. Rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology have led to an explosion of genomic data. This data contains valuable knowledge about human biology and human disease, but few existing computational methods are designed to scale to the joint analysis of tens of thousands of human genomes.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8521270,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,172287,0.019484170439912414
"Mitigating risk in a closed loop system by exercise detection and miniaturization No abstract available PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the US, approximately 1 million people have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputation. Improving blood glucose control with a miniaturized closed loop (automated) system for use within real world situations including those in which patients move about freely and exercise, as proposed here, will decrease the risk of hypoglycemia and the risk of complications that can be debilitating, such as eye disease, and life-threatening, such as heart attacks. Such benefits will improve the quality of life for the individual with diabetes and reduce the cost to society as a whole.            ",Mitigating risk in a closed loop system by exercise detection and miniaturization,8639368,DP3DK101044,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Bicycling', 'Blindness', 'Blood Glucose', 'Car Phone', 'Catheters', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communication', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Eye diseases', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Glucagon', 'Glucose', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Individual', 'Infusion procedures', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Kidney Failure', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Muscle', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Power Sources', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Severities', 'Simulate', 'Societies', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'cost', 'design', 'glucose sensor', 'glucose uptake', 'improved', 'insulin sensitivity', 'miniaturize', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'strength training', 'success', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,DP3,2013,2943303,-0.01824277620125861
"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units  Project Summary  Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.  The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.  We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting the incorporation continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.  If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.  Project Narrative The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorparation of continous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecaststs that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury. Therefore, their successful forecast can lead to a paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and ehance the efficiency in a neurocritical care.",Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units,8256763,R01NS066008,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain scan', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral Ventricles', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Professional', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intensive Care', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interest', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prophylactic', 'time interval']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2012,330138,0.009498096392504726
"Genetic predictors of anti-TNF treatment response and infections in IBD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) affect over 1.4 million Americans. Over the past 15 years, considerable progress has been made in the therapy of CD and UC with monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor ¿ (anti-TNF) representing the most significant therapeutic breakthrough. However, many patients fail to respond adequately. Recent genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have significantly increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of CD and UC. The role of these genetic variants in predicting response to anti-TNF therapy is yet to be defined adequately. In addition, significant safety concerns remain with the use of these agents with serious infections occurring in up to 10% of patients. There is a strong genetic component to susceptibility to infections, in particular involving polymorphisms in innate immunity. Given the key role of innate immunity in IBD pathogenesis, whether such shared polymorphisms also influence risk of infections on anti-TNF therapy has not been examined previously. Thus, the development of tools to define likelihood of treatment response and infections are a key unmet need in the field. Our overarching objective is to identify clinical and genetic predictors of both short-term and long-term response as well as infectious complications of anti-TNF therapy. To achieve these aims, we will utilize the complementary strengths of two large cohorts - a prospective registry cohort of over 1200 patients with CD or UC, and a novel EMR-based cohort of over 11,000 patients with CD or UC linked to a biospecimen repository. This proposal utilizes the mentorship and significant expertise in key areas including analytical genetics, translational immunology, and bioinformatics and allows the candidate to develop fundamental skills in these novel content areas and research methods. The access to expertise at the NIH-funded center Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside, the Center for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the Broad Institute is a key strength of this application. This career development award will be critical in providing training in bioinformatics and genetic epidemiology, thus contributing to the candidate's long-term goal of establishing an independent IBD research career with focus on defining at-risk cohorts and personalizing therapy. The training component of the award includes graduate-level courses in the relevant content areas in genetic epidemiology, and bioinformatics at the Harvard Medical School, School of Public Health, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The candidate will continue to actively engage with an established group of multidisciplinary researchers who have demonstrated the utility of the EMR-based approach to accurately define autoimmune diseases, link it to biospecimen collection, and use it successfully for genotyping-phenotype research. This will help foster collaborative development of future proposals as the work proposed in this application has the potential for applicability in other cohorts.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit. Such work is a step toward developing personalized medicine approaches to tailor therapy based on likelihood of benefit and risk. The methodology developed here will also have applications in other EMR-based cohorts to investigate novel therapeutic agents and disease outcomes.                    The novel information gained from this study regarding genetic predictors of treatment response and infectious complications has the potential to transform clinical practice by leading to clinical trials focused on selected cohorts of patients most likely to respond to therapies with low risk of adverse events, thus preventing unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic therapies with low likelihood of benefit.

"ICP Elevation Alerting Based on a Predictive Model Hosting Platform    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recurring acute ICP elevations occur frequently and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. ICP elevation can cause cerebral ischemia and lead to deadly brain herniation if untreated. Hence, prompt recognition and treatment of rising ICP are critical in managing severe brain injury patients. However, existing protocols in most neurocritical care units are reactive where bedside nurses, in response to simple threshold-crossing alarms, have to check numerical display of ICP on monitors to manually establish whether the alarm is a true one before initiating treatment. Acute ICP elevation is accompanied by distinctive ICP pulse morphological changes. By utilizing ICP pulse morphological metrics as input, we can accurately recognize precursors to ICP elevation to alert nurses and free them from a cognitively demanding process of establishing whether a consistent ICP elevation triggers the alarm. We therefore propose to deploy a previously developed accurate ICP elevation prediction model on an open-source model hosting platform to monitor continuous ICP signals and alert bedside nurses. Using this alerting system, we will further investigate the principal physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation showing different precursory ICP patterns prior to onset of elevation. We will pursue the following three aims: 1) To develop an alerting system for ICP elevation based on a model hosting platform; 2) To investigate whether the ICP alerting system helps nurses more efficiently manage ICP. 3) To detect consistent physiological abnormalities associated with acute ICP elevation.  Our long-term goal is to advance intensive care monitoring so that continuous signals from monitors are fully explored to integrate with the rest of clinical data in an electronic medical record (EMR) system to enhance clinical decision making. This project represents an effort piloting a platform-based approach towards overcoming translational barriers that impede the process of making advanced predictive analytics available at point of care. Therefore, broad impacts from this project are related to future efforts at leveraging this open model hosting platform to facilitate the translation of additional predictive models in other ICUs.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients. These acute ICP elevations needs prompt treatment before they impair blood flow to the brain and cause deadly brain herniation. The present work is built upon our previously developed algorithm of detecting acute ICP elevation and an open software platform for hosting predictive algorithms to further develop and evaluate a real-time ICP elevation alerting system that will provide accurate alerts of impending ICP elevation. Rigorous human factor engineering principles and techniques will be adopted in developing this system and we will further leverage this real-time alerting system to investigate the principal physiological abnormalities that are associated with accurate ICP elevation.              Recurring acute intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation occurs frequently, up to more than 20 in a 12-hour nursing shift, and unpredictably among severe brain injury patients.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8301548,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2012,172287,0.019484170439912414
"Detecting deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient [1]. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our preliminary studies provide support that such deviations often indicate clinically important events for which it is worthwhile to raise an alert. We propose an evaluation based on physician assessment of alerts that are generated from a retrospective set of intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in critical care by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast.

"Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Typical of current large-scale biomedical data is the feature of small number of observed samples and the widely observed sample heterogeneity. Identifying differentially expressed genes related to the sample phenotye (e.g., cancer disease development) and predicting sample phenotype based on the gene expressions are some central research questions in the microarray data analysis. Most existing statistical methods have ignored sample heterogeneity and thus loss power.       This project proposes to develop novel statistical methods that explicitly address the small sample size and sampe heterogeneity issues, and can be applied very generally. The usefulness of these methods will be shown with the large-scale biomedical data originating from the lung and kidney transplant research projects. The transplant projects aimed to improve the molecular diagnosis and therapy of lung/kidney allograft rejection by identifying molecular biomarkers to predict the allograft rejection for critical early treatment and rapid, noninvasive, and economical testing.       The specific aims are 1) Develop novel statistical methods for differential gene expression detection that explicitly model sample heterogeneity. 2) Develop novel statistical methods for classifying high-dimensional biomedical data and incorporating sample heterogeneity. 3) Develop novel statistical methods for jointly analyzing a set of genes (e.g., genes in a pathway). 4) Use the developed models and methods to answer research questions relevant to public health in the lung and kidney transplant projects; and implement and validate the proposed methods in user-friendly and well-documented software, and distribute them to the scientific community at no charge.       It is very important to identify new biomarkers of allograft rejection in lung and kidney transplant recipients. The rapid and reliable detection and prediction of rejection in easily obtainable body fluids may allow the rapid advancement of clinical interventional trials. We propose to study novel methods for analyzing the large-scale biomedical data to realize their full potential of molecular diagnosis and prognosis of transplant rejection prediction for critical early treatment.          n/a",Statistical Model Building for High Dimensional Biomedical Data,8079474,R01GM083345,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Fluids', 'Cations', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Experimental Designs', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Graft Rejection', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Joints', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Oncogene Activation', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'allograft rejection', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer microarray', 'cancer type', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney allograft', 'method development', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'software development', 'sound', 'theories', 'transplant database', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2011,250488,-0.03313463057881825
"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education  with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in  clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic  kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral  funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an  independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD  care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician  (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on  experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research,  and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop  into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the  development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors.  In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and  large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel-  Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and  commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher.   An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his  research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and  the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to  develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum  chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed  logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will  conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model  in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients  for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with  an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care  delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data  mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and  implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher.   In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance  provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is  a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD.  Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of  Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in  predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical  informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a  highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise  in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the  general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and  CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of  disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models.  This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and  expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training.   To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal  coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical  Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational  Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial  implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research  and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses  that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills.   In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a  sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to  use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The  applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the  formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful  independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder.

"Detecting deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient [1]. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our preliminary studies provide support that such deviations often indicate clinically important events for which it is worthwhile to raise an alert. We propose an evaluation based on physician assessment of alerts that are generated from a retrospective set of intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in critical care by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit.

"A web hospital comparison tool for patients considering kidney transplantation an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for objective hospital quality ranking tools that are relevant to patients' experiences and customizable to their individual conditions. This need is created by market changes where patients are increasingly being made aware of differences in quality between providers who will improve their odds at success. Medicare, state governments, insurers and several private companies offer information on hospital quality and cost across many conditions and incorporating a variety of data, process and outcomes quality indicators. However, according to investors, bankers, industry analysts and entrepreneurs, comparison tools are still at an embryonic stage. They suffer from limited specificity, low resolution, conflicts of interest and misfit in the patient information finding process. This leads to patient confusion and perceptions that information is meaningless for decision making. PickCare (tm) is a hospital comparison tool that will address gaps that exist in current hospital ranking systems using advanced statistical and econometric models that have never been applied in this space.

In phase 2 we will expand to Pickcare v3.0 to 1) accommodate user feedback from phase 1, 2) scale to accommodate more treatments beginning with dialysis and 3) further imbed the system in patients' information finding process.

"Detecting deviations in clinical care in ICU data streams    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Timely detection of severe patient conditions or concerning events and their mitigation remains an important problem in clinical practice. This is especially true in the critically ill patient [1]. Typical computer-based detection methods developed for this purpose rely on the use of clinical knowledge, such as expert-derived rules, that are incorporated into monitoring and alerting systems. However, it is often time-consuming, costly, and difficult to extract and implement such knowledge in existing monitoring systems. The research work in this proposal offers computational, rather than expert-based, solutions that build alert systems from data stored in patient data repositories, such as electronic medical records. Briefly, our approach uses advanced machine learning algorithms to identify unusual clinical management patterns in individual patients, relative to patterns associated with comparable patients, and raises an alert signaling this discrepancy. Our preliminary studies provide support that such deviations often indicate clinically important events for which it is worthwhile to raise an alert. We propose an evaluation based on physician assessment of alerts that are generated from a retrospective set of intensive-care unit (ICU) patient cases. The project investigators comprise a multidisciplinary team with expertise in critical care medicine, computer science, biomedical informatics, statistical machine learning, knowledge based systems, and clinical data repositories.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There remain numerous opportunities to reduce medical errors in critical care by sending computer-based reminders and alerts to clinicians.

"Information Systems for Detecting and Managing Acute Kidney Injury    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication among hospitalized patients and heralds a 3-5 fold increase in mortality, increased costs, and potential lifelong dependence on dialysis. While clinical decision support systems (CDSS) have previously assisted with the medical management of chronic kidney disease, there has been no validated approach for a CDSS to identify AKI and facilitate a medical intervention at an early stage. We propose to develop an AKI detection algorithm using laboratory and bedside measurements that are typically available in electronic medical records. We will validate the algorithm against the judgment of an expert nephrology review panel and use the latest published standards for AKI staging. As a second step, we plan to create models (using both traditional and machine learning approaches) that predict progression of AKI by incorporating comorbidities, admission diagnoses, and exposure to nephrotoxic therapies. Once the electronic criteria for early AKI are defined, we will build and evaluate a hospital-wide CDSS for managing early AKI. The goal is to prevent AKI progression and the associated complications of hypokalemia, acidemia, and medication toxicity.           Project Narrative: Hospitalized patients who develop impaired kidney function are at increased risk of dying or developing adverse events.

"Continuous-Signal Driven Predictive Models in Neurological Intensive Care Units    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most medical interventions are primarily prescribed to respond to clinical symptoms or abnormal physiological values under conventional patient management protocols. In contrast, prophylactic or proactive protocols can substantially improve outcomes and decrease escalating costs of healthcare if supported by reliable and actionable forecasts of critical clinical events. However, in most clinical environments, health care professionals are only able to access data that are, at best, up to the present time. Long-term goal of our research is to provide reliable clinical forecasts of individual patient's critical parameters and events by predictive data mining of heterogeneous medical, physiological, and biological data. As a prototypical clinical forecast application in a neurological intensive care environment, the main objective of the proposed project is to demonstrate the efficacy of earlier recognition of two common intracranial secondary insults including acute ventriculomegaly (enlargement of the brain ventricles) and acute elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) based on integrating, under a novel classifier fusion framework, machine learning algorithms and novel quantitative metrics that were recently discovered by our group in processing continuous ICP signals.    The need for forecasting ventriculomegaly and elevated ICP is particularly relevant in a neurological intensive care unit (NICU) where an array of continuously monitored signals are used to support management of patients of complex and severe neurological disorders at their acute phase. These critically ill patients are susceptible to many forms of delayed but treatable secondary injuries. Therefore, an early detection of developing secondary insults prior to clinical symptoms is directly relevant to support the adoption of proactive patient management whose efficacy can be demonstrated in a follow-up randomized clinical trial.    We propose two aims to first build a general framework supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that comprise of a set of classifiers. These classifiers are spaced at different time intervals relative to the time of interest and their results are fused to provide an improved forecast. The second aim includes two sub aims to build two protypical forecasts useful in a neurocritical care environment. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.    If successful, the forecast of ICP elevation and ventriculomegaly can lead to a potential paradigam shift from conventional reactive patient management to a more proactive management protocol and improve patient outcome and enhance the efficiency in neurocritical care.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this project are to first develop a generic framework for supporting incorporation of continuous physiological signals into a predictive model that can be used for providing clinical forecasts. Then we will investigate the performance of two protypical forecasts that are very useful in managing brain injury patients in a neurocritical care unit. The first forecast concerns early detection of ventriculomegaly and the second forecast concerns prediction of acute ICP elevation, both of which are common forms of secondary insult after traumatic and hemorrhagic brain injury.

"A web hospital comparison tool for patients considering kidney transplantation an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for objective hospital quality ranking tools that are relevant to patients' experiences and customizable to their individual conditions. This need is created by market changes where patients are increasingly being made aware of differences in quality between providers who will improve their odds at success. Medicare, state governments, insurers and several private companies offer information on hospital quality and cost across many conditions and incorporating a variety of data, process and outcomes quality indicators. However, according to investors, bankers, industry analysts and entrepreneurs, comparison tools are still at an embryonic stage. They suffer from limited specificity, low resolution, conflicts of interest and misfit in the patient information finding process. This leads to patient confusion and perceptions that information is meaningless for decision making. PickCare (tm) is a hospital comparison tool that will address gaps that exist in current hospital ranking systems using advanced statistical and econometric models that have never been applied in this space. In phase 1 we developed Pickcare v2.0 in kidney transplantation and showed that: 1) these models improve specificity through customization to patient factors that our analysis unearths are most important; 2) our models improve resolution by using an expanded history of risk factors; 3) the user interface tested with patients/ family communicates the system's improved resolution as differences across hospitals that patients can understand, and its specificity as a message of hope and alternatives.

"Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid and accurate triage is essential when dealing with acutely injured persons. To that end, a number of trauma triage decision aids have been proposed. Unfortunately, mistriage rates for trauma patients remain high, due in part to aids that lack precision or discrimination, are not used, or are misused or misapplied. Improving the trauma triage process is an important problem because doing so improves trauma triage outcomes by optimizing access to and utilization of specialized resources as well as reducing morbidity and mortality. A promising method for improving this process is to integrate machine learning algorithms as a rapid and accurate clinical decision support technique. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop rules to diagnosis myocardial infarction and to provide rapid and accurate decision support in nonmedical settings. They have also been used to predict mortality following injury. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms for clinical decision support employs highly accurate predictive models to counter the previously mentioned pitfalls of existing trauma decision aids in the following ways: (1) collecting relevant readily available clinical information, (2) choosing the most accurate predictive model for the situation at hand, and (3) utilizing computational speed and power to optimize predictive accuracy. The goal of this AREA proposal is to test the feasibility of machine learning-based predictive modeling techniques to support trauma triage. We plan to use well-established predictive model development and evaluation techniques to: (1) Compare the existing American College of Surgeons trauma triage decision aid to four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques; (2) Compare the performance of four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques with and without a novel measure of change in physiological status; and (3) Compare the performance of full machine learning models to those derived using information gathered as a byproduct of the workflow. Models will predict persons with severe injury or need for specialized trauma resources. Successful integration of machine learning algorithms is a first step toward developing an adaptive computer assisted trauma triage system that not only helps clinicians make better decisions but also facilitates rapid access to specialized resources.           n/a",Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT),7252385,R15GM080697,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Records', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Numbers', 'Operating Rooms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Speed', 'Support of Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'disability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'injured', 'innovation', 'model development', 'mortality', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R15,2007,216300,0.018447139587363028
"Sedation Management in Pediatric Patients supported on * DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this two-year project is to pilot test an intervention to change sedation management in pediatric patients supported on mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). While ensuring patient comfort is an integral part of pediatric critical care, analgesic and sedative use in this patient population can be associated with iatrogenic injury; specifically, comfort medications may depress spontaneous ventilation and prolong the duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation. Additionally, drug tolerance develops over time and may precipitate iatrogenic abstinence syndrome when the patient no longer requires sedation. Alternatively, suboptimal comfort management contributes to ventilator dysynchrony and unplanned endotracheal extubation. Our group has developed and validated a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications that may optimize patient comfort and reduce the risk of under-medication, but this algorithm needs to be evaluated further. We will pilot test the sedation algorithm in a randomized controlled clinical trial of two matched pediatric intensive care units in two different hospitals. One hospital will be randomized to their usual standard practices for managing sedation, while the other will receive (a) multidisciplinary team education and consensus building, (b) multidisciplinary team identification of the patient's trajectory of illness and daily prescription of a sedation goal, (c) a nurse-implemented sedation algorithm to guide titration of comfort medications, and (d) team feedback on clinical performance.      We hypothesize that pediatric patients managed per sedation protocol will experience fewer days of mechanical ventilation than patients receiving usual care. Secondary outcomes include time to recovery from acute lung injury, duration of weaning from mechanical ventilation, occurrence of adverse events, total exposure to comfort medications, occurrence of iatrogenic opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, PICU length of stay, barriers to successful implementation of the intervention and PICU costs.    The overall objective of this study is to develop an intervention that can be implemented in any PICU that will provide comfort to intubated and mechanically ventilated infants and children that will not cause them harm.

"Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study PROJECT SUMMARY Road traffic injuries are a major contributor to the burden of disease globally with nearly 1.3 million deaths globally and as many as 50 million injured annually with pedestrians and cyclists in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) among the most affected. Road infrastructure of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks), neighborhood design (e.g., street connectivity) and urban development (e.g., urban sprawl) are key determinants of the risk of pedestrian injuries. In LMICs, poor road infrastructure and neighborhood design are acknowledged as being important contributors to rising numbers of road traffic injuries and deaths, but there are few studies systematically identifying and quantifying what specific features of the built environment are contributing to motor vehicle collisions in these settings. Within LMIC cities, there are often large disparities where infrastructure is improved that reflect socioeconomic characteristics, leading to health inequities in road traffic injury. The paucity of georeferenced data on the built environment in LMICs has made research on road traffic injuries more difficult, though recent advances in computer vision and image analysis combined with Big Data of publicly available, georeferenced, images of roads worldwide (e.g., Google Street View, GSV) can help overcome the paucity of data and the cost and time limitations of collecting and analyzing data on the built environment in LMICs. Automated image analysis has largely been made possible via deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning and relies on training neural networks to detect and label specific objects within images. These methods can drastically reduce the barriers to citywide built environment and traffic safety research in LMIC cities, thus substantially increasing research capacity and generalizability. My career goal is to become an independent investigator in global urban health with a focus on road safety and the built environment in LMICs. I propose undertaking research and training in deep learning methods applied to public health in the setting of Bogota, Colombia: 1) Develop neural networks to create a database of BE features of the road infrastructure from image data and to create neighborhood typologies from those features; 2) Assess the association between neighborhood-level BE features and typologies and pedestrian collisions and fatalities and road safety perceptions; 3) Assess the association of neighborhood social environment characteristics with pedestrian collision and fatalities, perceptions, and BE features and typologies. I am seeking additional training in 1) developing competency in deep learning methods applied to public health; 2) creating neighborhood indictors and typologies of health and the built environment; 3) applying Bayesian spatiotemporal models to understand how neighborhood characteristics and typologies influence health; 4) develop skills in multi-country collaboration, grant writing and overseeing research projects in LMICs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Roads and neighborhoods with a built environment that support safe and active transportation are a major priority in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to 90% of road traffic deaths occurring in these locations, especially to pedestrians and other vulnerable road users, yet data on key built environment features at a large scale are not always readily available in these settings. My career goal is to improve population health by examining the effects of the built environment and transportation on health through the adoption and use of methods that can leverage Big Data sources and answer complex, multilevel research questions by overcoming the lack of built environment data in LMICs. The proposed research uses deep learning and advanced statistical methods to create a citywide dataset of built and social environment features in Bogota, Colombia that will provide crucial data to answer questions of their impact on pedestrian injuries and deaths, as well as assessing the presence of health inequities in their distribution and that will lay the groundwork to expand these efforts to more cities in Latin America and other LMICs.","Built Environment, Pedestrian Injuries and Deep Learning (BEPIDL) Study",10123391,K01TW011782,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cities', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Colombia', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Education', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Latin America', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Perception', 'Persons', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Social Environment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Typology', 'Urban Developments', 'Urban Health', 'Vehicle crash', 'Writing', 'automated image analysis', 'built environment', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data infrastructure', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'learning strategy', 'low and middle-income countries', 'neighborhood association', 'neural network', 'pedestrian injury', 'population health', 'skills', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'spatiotemporal', 'virtual']",FIC,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,138024,-0.0017640102388740383
"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement.

"Crowd-Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) Digital Curation to Translate Big Data into Precision Medicine PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The NIH and other agencies are funding high-throughput genomics (‘omics) experiments that deposit digital samples of data into the public domain at breakneck speeds. This high-quality data measures the ‘omics of diseases, drugs, cell lines, model organisms, etc. across the complete gamut of experimental factors and conditions. The importance of these digital samples of data is further illustrated in linked peer-reviewed publications that demonstrate its scientific value. However, meta-data for digital samples is recorded as free text without biocuration necessary for in-depth downstream scientific inquiry.  Deep learning is revolutionary machine intelligence paradigm that allows for an algorithm to program itself thereby removing the need to explicitly specify rules or logic. Whereas physicians / scientists once needed to first understand a problem to program computers to solve it, deep learning algorithms optimally tune themselves to solve problems. Given enough example data to train on, deep learning machine intelligence outperform humans on a variety of tasks. Today, deep learning is state-of-the-art performance for image classification, and, most importantly for this proposal, for natural language processing.  This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples. We will then develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation based on learning the associated free text meta-data each digital sample. Given the ongoing deluge of biomedical data in the public domain, CrADLe may perhaps be the only way to scale the digital curation towards a precision medicine ideal.  Finally, we will demonstrate the biological utility to leverage CrADLe for digital curation with two large- scale and independent molecular datasets in: 1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and 2) The Accelerating Medicines Partnership-Alzheimer’s Disease (AMP-AD). We posit that CrADLe digital curation of open samples will augment these two distinct disease projects with a host big data to fuel the discovery of potential biomarker and gene targets. Therefore, successful funding and completion of this work may greatly reduce the burden of disease on patients by enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of digital curation for biomedical big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal is about engineering Crowd Assisted Deep Learning (CrADLe) machine intelligence to rapidly scale the digital curation of public digital samples and directly translating this ‘omics data into useful biological inference. We will first use our NIH BD2K-funded Search Tag Analyze Resource for Gene Expression Omnibus (STARGEO.org) to crowd-source human annotation of open digital samples on which we will develop and train deep learning algorithms for STARGEO digital curation of free-text sample-level metadata.

"CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients Project Summary/Abstract While artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are becoming widely used throughout medicine, the analysis of the cost of an ML model’s predictions has been very limited. For example, an ML model may accurately predict that a trauma patient will have acute traumatic coagulopathy (ATC), a bleeding disorder; however, it may heavily rely on hard-to-measure patient features, like blood pressure or Glasgow Coma Score, to do so. Standard ML techniques do not prioritize timely diagnosis, which is key to minimize death and injury. This idea, which we refer to as cost-aware prediction, is a topic of recent interest in machine learning. However, existing methods have substantial limitations, and their clinical impact has not been demonstrated. This proposal will adopt recent advances in ML and explainable AI to 1) develop improved cost-aware prediction techniques. 2) demonstrate their value using clinical data and 3) integrate them into the electronic medical record. These methods will be applicable in many areas of science and medicine. Aim 1. Develop a novel feature importance-based approach for cost-aware prediction. No existing approach for cost-aware prediction consistently outperforms the others, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. This proposal uses recent discoveries in machine learning to design a new algorithm, CoAI, with new strengths and fewer weaknesses. CoAI will substantially improve predictive performance, enable analysis on large datasets, and flexibly work with any ML model. Preliminary results show that CoAI can outperform existing methods. A new public benchmark for cost-aware prediction will be created and used to compare CoAI to existing methods, and CoAI will be published as easy-to-use open-source software. Aim 2. Evaluate CoAI’s potential for clinical time savings. CoAI’s ability to predict bleeding disorders will be tested on an unprecedentedly detailed dataset that combines trauma hospital data with surveys of doctors and paramedics. Comparing CoAI to the risk scores used in clinical practice will provide explicit estimates of how much time CoAI can save and how many misdiagnoses it can prevent. In preliminary analysis with trauma registry data, CoAI reduces prediction time and increases accuracy relative to an existing risk score. Aim 3. Incorporate an interactive ML method into the medical record. CoAI will be integrated into the electronic medical record (EMR), using feedback from professional paramedics. Quantitative estimates of time and cost savings and subjective impressions will be gathered from paramedics, and open-ended interviews will be conducted to assess their feelings about interactive machine learning methods like CoAI. These insights will guide future research in interactive machine learning methods, as well as possible clinical work to study CoAI’s impact on decision making in simulated trauma scenarios.  Successful completion of this project will allow faster, more accurate diagnosis of acute illness and advance the state of the art in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Project Narrative Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming an integral part of healthcare, from automatic radiology reading and triage to early-warning systems that detect adverse events during surgery. Until recently, AI systems have not been optimized to rely on data that can be gathered quickly or easily. We believe developing AI systems that can intelligently minimize the cost their use imposes on health care providers will lead to more efficient patient risk prediction and diagnosis, and will ultimately save lives.",CoAI: Cost-Aware Artificial Intelligence for Efficient Prehospital Diagnosis of Trauma Patients,9907467,F30HL151074,"['Acute', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Awareness', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Budgets', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coma', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Future', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Interview', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Triage', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data registry', 'design', 'falls', 'flexibility', 'impression', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient registry', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'theories', 'time use', 'usability']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F30,2020,41178,-0.009140096359057869
"BOND: Benchmarking based on heterogeneous biOmedical Network and Deep learning novel drug-target associations Project Summary/Abstract The applicant’s goals are to develop the necessary skills to become an independent translational biomedical informatics researcher in the area of computational drug repurposing. Exploring novel drug-target interactions (DTI) plays a crucial role in drug development. In order to lower the overall costs and uncover more potential screening targets, computational (in silico) methods have become popular and are commonly applied to poly-pharmacology and drug repurposing. Although machine learning-based strategies have been studied for years, there is no standardized benchmark that provides large-scale training datasets as well as diverse evaluation tasks to test different methods. Furthermore, the existing methods suffer from remarkable limitations, where 1) results are often biased due to a lack of negative samples, 2) novel drug-target associations with new (or isolated) drugs/targets cannot be explored, and 3) the comprehensive topological structure cannot be captured by feature learning methods . Therefore, in the era of big data, the applicant proposes a study to tackle the challenges by achieving two aims. • Aim 1 (K99 Phase): Develop a large scale benchmark for evaluating drug-target prediction based on the  generation of a multipartite network from heterogeneous biomedical datasets. • Aim 2 (R00 Phase): Adapt a deep learning model to build an accurate predictive model based on a novel  feature learning algorithm that mines the multi-dimensional biomedical network (multipartite network). In the mentored phase, the applicant will integrate heterogeneous biomedical datasets and build a benchmark for evaluation of the drug-target prediction based on well-designed strategies. The applicant will receive training in standardization tools for data integration, tools, and skills for data management, evaluation methods for drug-target predictions, and state-of-the-art machine learning/deep learning methods in computer-aided pharmacology. Complementary didactic, intellectual, and professional training will help prepare the applicant for the R00 phase where he will develop a deep learning-based predictive model and multi-dimensional graph embedding methods for feature learning. Together, these novel studies will advance the current computational drug repurposing by providing 1) comprehensive benchmarking for testing and evaluation, and 2) a scalable and accurate predictive model based on a biomedical multi-partite network. The applicant will be mentored by senior, established investigators with substantial expertise in Semantic Web, computational biology, cancer genomics, drug development, and machine learning/deep learning. Importantly, this project will provide a foundation for the applicant to establish independent research programs in 1) computational drug repurposing in real cases, 2) investigation of the diverse hidden associations in system biology (e.g., associations between drugs, genetics, and diseases), and 3) precision medicine aimed applications leveraging biomedical knowledgebases and electronic health records. Project Narrative The field of computational drug repurposing lacks a large scale benchmark that provides comprehensive and standard evaluation tasks as well as a scalable and accurate prediction model that can handle large biomedical datasets. This study aims to utilize Semantic Web technology to construct a multi-partite network based on heterogeneous biomedical databases and develop a deep learning-based predictive model based on the network. The proposed investigation will advance this field by providing a large scale benchmark for evaluation as well as a predictive model based on state-of-the-art technology.",BOND: Benchmarking based on heterogeneous biOmedical Network and Deep learning novel drug-target associations,10054989,K99GM135488,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base Ratios', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Clinic', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Silver', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genomics', 'computer based Semantic Analysis', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'in silico', 'knowledge base', 'large scale data', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'repository', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool']",NIGMS,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K99,2020,100000,0.0008728848131753245
"A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies ABSTRACT More people die every year from kidney disease than breast or prostate cancer. Kidney transplantation is life-saving, yet the donor organ shortage and high organ discard rate contributes to 13 deaths daily among patients awaiting transplant. The decision to use or discard a donor kidney relies heavily on microscopic quantitation of chronic damage by pathologists. The current standard of care relies on a manual process that is subject to significant human variability and inefficiency, resulting in potentially healthy kidneys being discarded and potentially damaged kidneys being transplanted inappropriately. Our team developed the first Deep Learning model to quantify percent global glomerulosclerosis in donor kidney frozen section biopsy whole slide images. We developed a cloud-based platform to apply the Deep Learning model to analyze kidney biopsy whole slide images in under 6 minutes with accuracy and precision equal to or greater than current standard of care pathologists. We have also developed a Deep Learning model to quantify interstitial fibrosis on donor kidney biopsy whole slide images. This innovative approach has the potential to transform donor kidney biopsy evaluation by improving pathologist efficiency, accuracy, and precision ultimately resulting in optimized donor organ utilization, improved patient outcomes, and diminished health care costs. The goal of this project is to establish our Deep Learning automated techniques as the standard for evaluating donor kidneys prior to transplantation. This will be achieved by assembling a team of expert pathologists and computer scientists specializing in machine learning. The proposal will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the interstitial fibrosis Deep Learning model, use the automated quantitation of key microscopic findings to develop an outcome-based chronic damage score that predicts graft outcome, and test the ability of the Deep Learning models to withstand variations encountered using different scanners and processing in different laboratories. The functionality of the Trusted Kidney software platform will be improved beyond the current usable product into a commercially viable solution for multiple laboratories. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Before kidneys can be transplanted, they must be examined using a microscope to ensure the kidney is healthy enough for transplant. A limitation of microscopic examination by pathologists is the inherent human variability in quantifying the amount of scar tissue, or chronic damage, present. The result is potentially healthy organs being discarded or damaged kidneys being used inappropriately. This funding will support developing artificial intelligence tools to assist pathologists with quantifying scar tissue in donor kidneys prior to transplantation, resulting in more consistent and objective biopsy evaluations, minimizing discard of potentially healthy kidneys, and optimizing placement of kidneys for transplant.",A Deep Learning Model to Improve Pathologist Interpretation of Donor Kidney Biopsies,10138826,R42DK120253,"['Adoption', 'Americas', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Canada', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Fibrosis', 'Frozen Sections', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graft Survival', 'Health Care Costs', 'Human', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Midwestern United States', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Procurements', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Slide', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Transplantation', 'Trichrome stain', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Trust', 'United Network for Organ Sharing', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cloud based', 'cloud platform', 'commercial application', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'functional improvement', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'pathology imaging', 'phase 1 study', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'renal damage', 'shared database', 'standard of care', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'whole slide imaging']",NIDDK,"NEWVENTUREIQ, LLC",R42,2020,811695,0.016119580152851323
"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage.

"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,10020414,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2020,388750,0.008769978916610823

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network PROJECT SUMMARY  Individuals with substance use disorders are disproportionately experiencing homelessness, poverty, and chronic medical conditions (diabetes and hypertension), which are emerging risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 (official name for the virus that causes COVID-19). Different types of substance use have been associated with development of respiratory infections and progression to severe respiratory failure, also known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). However, complex syndromes like ARDS and behavioral conditions like substance misuse are difficult to identify from the electronic health record. Clinical notes and radiology reports provide a rich source of information that may be used to identify cases of substance misuse and ARDS. This information is routinely recorded during hospital care, and automated, data-driven solutions with natural language processing (NLP) can extract semantics and important risk factors from the unstructured data of clinical notes. The computational methods of NLP derive meaning from clinical notes, from which machine learning can predict risk factors for patients leaving AMA or progressing to respiratory failure. Our team developed tools with >80% sensitivity/specificity to identify individual types of substance misuse using NLP with machine learning (ML). Our single-center models delineated risk factors embedded in the notes (e.g., mental health conditions, socioeconomic indicators). Further, we have developed and externally validated a machine learning tool to identify cases of ARDS with high accuracy for early treatment. We aim to expand this work by pooling data across health systems and build a generalizable and comprehensive classifier that captures multiple types of substance misuse for use in risk stratification and prognostication during the COVID pandemic.  We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal analysis of hospitalized patients, and that such information can be used to identify those at risk for disrupted care and those at risk for respiratory failure. We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 60,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. This Administrative Supplement will allow us to examine the correlations between substances of misuse and risk for COVID-19 as well as development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the context of these phenomena. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse and COVID-19 from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of a digital classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test the classifier retrospectively on an existing dataset of 60,000 patients. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10173503,UG1DA049467,"['2019-nCoV', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disasters', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Felis catus', 'General Population', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Home environment', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hurricane', 'Hypertension', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Sterility', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'digital', 'drug market', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'mortality risk', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'overdose death', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'screening', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'social stigma', 'socioeconomics', 'substance misuse', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'unstructured data']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2020,139752,-0.04161931281309973
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder. In this project, we propose to develop a fully automatic image post-processing pipeline and multidimensional big data analyses based on machine learning techniques, with the aim to uncover latent information from complex dataset and with the ultimate goal of setting up a platform for OA precision medicine",Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis,9934128,R00AR070902,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'California', 'Cartilage', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'algorithm development', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'career development', 'cartilage degradation', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'feature extraction', 'heterogenous data', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging scientist', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'kinematics', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'multidimensional data', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'parallel processing', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'racial difference', 'repository', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R00,2020,249000,-0.011795688963957078
"CTSA Administrative Supplement for Informatics Core: A novel AI/ML system to predict respiratory failure and ARDS in Covid-19 patients PROJECT SUMMARY The Einstein-Montefiore Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) proposes an Administrative Supplement pursuant to NOT-TR-20-011, CTSA Program Applications to Address 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19). Specifically, this application addresses the urgent need for research on the coronavirus pandemic with a project focusing on informatics and data science to preemptively identify patients with the life- threatening complications of SARS-CoV-2, using CTSA-supported core resources. Characterized by severe hypoxemia, tachypnea, and decreased lung compliance, the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a bad prognostic sign, and in a subset, leads to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The rates of Covid-19 infection and death in the Bronx have been higher than any other borough of NYC. As the major regional health system, our experience with Covid-19 provides guideposts that may prevent future victims of this pandemic. The bleak picture for ARDS in the 4,452 patients admitted showed that 78% of our intubated Covid-19 patients developed ARDS, with 42% mortality. The overall goal of this proposal is to leverage our novel informatics and analytics platforms enabled by the Einstein-Montefiore CTSA (NIH/NCATS 1ULTR002556), and extensive Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning resources to implement a novel, situational awareness and clinical decision support system for ARF and ARDS (SA-ARDS). We will re-train our existing deep learning models with data collected from Covid-19 patients and contextualize its implementation with data from the Covid-19 response during the pandemic in NYC. The SA-ARDS data platform will provide longitudinally integrated clinical data for research and multi-institutional and national collaborations, with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To integrate, re-train, and validate our novel, near real-time, Electronic Risk Assessment System (ERAS 1.0) optimized for early recognition of ARF, ARDS, and inpatient mortality; Aim 2: To develop an evidence based, real-time, and context appropriate Situational Awareness clinical decision support system targeting ARF and ARDS response (SA-ARDS); and Aim 3: Through our partner CTSA organizations, to standardize and disseminate ERAS 1.0 and the SA-ARDS to other health systems, including the NYC consortium of CTSA hubs and the PCORI INSIGHT network. We will use the clinical data underlying the SA-ARDS to support research in local, regional, and national collaborations. All the methods and tools developed will be shared with the CTSA community via NCATS' National Center for Data to Health (CD2H). PROJECT NARRATIVE The US is in the midst of a public health crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic. We will create an artificial intelligence system to provide an early warning system optimized for recognition of ARF, ARDS, and inpatient mortality, and provide a base for application of artificial intelligence to detection of other debilitating and potentially fatal outcomes of Covid-19.",CTSA Administrative Supplement for Informatics Core: A novel AI/ML system to predict respiratory failure and ARDS in Covid-19 patients,10158737,UL1TR002556,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Expert Systems', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Injuries', 'Hospitals', 'Hypoxemia', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung Compliance', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'New York City', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk Assessment', 'Seasons', 'Severities', 'Software Engineering', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'complex data ', 'coronavirus disease', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flu', 'health data', 'infection rate', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'preemptive intervention', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'software systems', 'tool']",NCATS,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,UL1,2020,1003424,0.009975521228618865
"Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Abstract Andrew Holbrook, Ph.D., is a Bayesian statistician with a broad background in applied, theoretical and compu- tational data science. His proposed research Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning tackles viral outbreak forecasting by combining Bayesian phylogenetic modeling with ﬂexible, `self-exciting' stochastic process models. The development and publication of open-source, high-performance computing software for his models will facilitate fast epidemiological ﬁeld response in a big data setting. Dr. Holbrook will apply his method- ology to the reconstruction of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic in the Americas, focusing on identifying key geographical routes of transmission and phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.  Candidate: Dr. Holbrook is Postdoctoral Scholar at the UCLA Department of Human Genetics. He earned his Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine, during which time he completed his dissertation Geometric Bayes, an investigation into Bayesian modeling and computing on abstract mathematical spaces, and simultaneously participated in scientiﬁc collaborations at the UC Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The proposed career development plan will establish Dr. Holbrook as an independent leader in data intensive viral epidemiology by 1) facilitating coursework to build biological domain knowledge, 2) affording Dr. Holbrook the opportunity to lead his own project while remaining under the expert oversight of UCLA Prof. Marc Suchard, M.D., Ph.D., and 3) allowing Dr. Holbrook to continue his focus on quantitative viral epidemiology once he has moved to a faculty commitment.  Mentors: During the ﬁrst three years of the award period, Dr. Holbrook will work closely with Prof. Suchard, continuing their current schedule of weekly meetings. Prof. Suchard is a leading expert in both Bayesian phylo- genetics and high-performance statistical computing; and with his medical background, Prof. Suchard will advise Dr. Holbrook in his expansion of domain knowledge in viral epidemiology. As secondary mentor, Prof. Kristian Andersen, Ph.D., of the Scripps Institute will advise Dr. Holbrook in the impactful application of his statistical and computational methodologies to the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic. Dr. Holbrook and Profs. Suchard and Andersen will maintain their collaborations after the postdoctoral period.  Research: Bayesian phylogenetics successfully reconstructs evolutionary histories but fails to predict viral spread. Self-exciting point processes are devoid of biological insight and fail to account for geographic networks of diffusion. Aim 1 addresses deﬁciencies in these two complementary viral epidemiological modeling techniques by innovating a combined model where the phylogenetic and self-excitatory components support each other. Aim 2 makes widespread adoption a reality by publishing open-source, massively parallel computing software suitable for big data analysis. Aim 3 reconstructs the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic, learns key geographical routes of transmission and identiﬁes phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness. Project Narrative Tracking and predicting viral outbreaks remains an open epidemiological problem with deadly consequences. Dr. Holbrook will attack the problem with his Bayesian phylogenetic Hawkes processes, a class of models tailored to simultaneously reconstruct evolutionary histories and predict viral diffusion dynamics. With the mentorship of Profs. Marc Suchard (primary) and Kristian Andersen (secondary), Dr. Holbrook will develop open-source, high-performance computing software and apply his statistical computing methodology to the analysis of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic of the Americas, learning key routes of transmission and identifying phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.",Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning,10039150,K25AI153816,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Air', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Americas', 'Award', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Herd Immunity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Ships', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Viral', 'Viral Epidemiology', 'Viral Physiology', 'Work', 'ZIKA', 'Zika Virus', 'blind', 'career development', 'epidemiological model', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel computer', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'statistics', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K25,2020,106467,-0.009227771756432985
"Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data 1. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The study of translational biomarkers in brain disorders is a very challenging and fruitful approach, which will empower a better understanding of healthy and diseased brains. This project will promote the translation of advanced engineering solutions and mathematic tools to novel neuroimaging applications in psychiatric disorders including major depression disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ), allowing sophisticated and powerful analyses on highly complex datasets. To date, the unifying syndrome classification (ICD-9/10;DSM-IV/5) for these mental disorders obscures our knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and cannot guide optimal treatments. For example, there is no biomarker that is able to precisely predict response of MDD to some treatments. One reason for this is that most neuroimaging prediction studies to date have used a single imaging measure or reported simple correlation relationships, without considering multimodal cross- information, nonlinear relationships, or multi-site cross-validation. Hence, developing novel data mining techniques such as deep learning, fusion with reference, and sparse regression can complement and exploit the richness of neuroimaging data, providing promising avenues to identify objective biomarkers and going beyond a descriptive use of brain imaging as traditionally used in studies of brain disease to individualized prediction. We will facilitate the translational biomarker identification by developing 3 novel data-driven methods: 1) A supervised fusion model that can provide insight on how cognitive impairment may affect covarying brain function and structure in mental disorder, by using different clinical measures as a reference to guide multimodal MRI fusion; 2) A cutting-edge prediction framework with aggregated feature selection techniques that is able to estimate clinical outcome more precisely, e.g., remission/relapse status of individual MDD patient after electroconvulsive treatment(ECT) using baseline brain imaging and demographic measures of 3) We will draw on advances and ideas from deep learning combined with layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) or attention modules, to classify multiple groups of psychiatric disorders by incorporating dynamic functional measures. The proposed (Deep/Recurrent/Convolutional Neural Network, DNN/RNN/CNN) models will have enhanced interpretability that is able to trace back and discover the most predictive functional networks from input. All above proposed methods will be applied to big data containing both multimodal imaging and behavioral information (n~5000) pooled from existing studies, and our developed open-source toolboxes will be shared publicly. This pioneering study may provide an urgently-needed paradigm shift in the treatment and diagnosis of psychiatric disorders, thereby guiding personalized clinical care. Accomplishment of this project has great potential to discover neuroimaging biomarkers that have been missed by existing approaches, leading to earlier and more effective interventions, and laying the groundwork for a significant translational impact. Project Narrative Psychiatric imaging is struggling with identifying robust biomarkers. Existing approaches do not fully leverage the power of multimodal data, despite evidence that such information is highly informative. We will draw on advances and ideas from fields of deep learning, supervised learning and functional dynamics, to capture rich information from multimodal imaging big data, and to identify precise biomarkers that are able to predict clinical measures for new individuals and help for intervention. We will pool big data from ongoing projects in multiple cohorts, consisting of a big data with imaging and behavioral info to apply clinical applications that will have profound translational medicine impact on schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders.",Data-driven approaches to identify biomarkers from multimodal imaging big data,9999673,R01MH117107,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'DSM-IV', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Engineering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'ICD-9', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'depressed patient', 'disease classification', 'effective intervention', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized predictions', 'predicting response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'treatment response', 'white matter']",NIMH,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,395331,0.004346682444413537
"Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care Project Summary/Abstract The best predictor of future injury is previous injury. Unfortunately, this has not changed in a quarter century, despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and the associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical treatment and/or clinical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Even with formal care, injured athletes are two- to four times (in extreme cases 100 times) more likely to suffer a second injury for up to two years after RTP. This is even more alarming given that 65% of initial sports-related injuries affect children and young adults (ages 5-24 years), setting them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. These data implicate the initial injury event as the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. Thus, an urgent need exists to revolutionize the current standard of post- injury care through better identification and targeting of deficits that underlie second injury risk to enable everyone to stay physically active and healthy for their whole lives. To address this need, we propose a pioneering approach that capitalizes on the biological concept of Phenotypic Plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments. Here PP is computed based on both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that reflect the functional movement capability of the athlete. The overall objective of this proposal is, therefore, to develop a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach for second injury prevention through the development of a systematic bioinformatics-driven approach for PP profile construction, and the training of genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence to establish treatment type and magnitude for precision enhancement of PP. The result of the proposed work will be a generalizable PP-based precision sports medicine approach via two expected outcomes: (1) a formalized phenotypic precision medicine approach to objectively quantify behavioral plasticity, and (2) the successful implementation of a platform leveraging genetic fuzzy artificial intelligence integrated with mixed reality for performance prediction. This platform will support delivery of personalized treatments for PP enhancement. These objectives are the critical first step for the development of a generalizable precision medicine approach that will revolutionize rehabilitation and finally stem the tide of second injury in sport. This contribution will be significant to push back against the initial injury tipping point and, in doing so, create a pathway for injured athletes to return safely to physical activity and to maintain a long-term healthy lifestyle. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because the proposed platform will lead to fewer young men and women who suffer from second injury and the negative effects that lead to poorer long-term health. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because the knowledge gained will be used to optimize new precision assessment and treatment strategies to prevent injury, and this will enhance health and reduce the burden of athletic injury.",Leveraging Artificial-Intelligence to Profile and Enhance Phenotypic Plasticity for Second Injury Prevention: An Innovative Precision Medicine Platform to Revolutionize Injury Care,9989850,R21EB027865,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Combinatorial Optimization', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic approach', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Services', 'Sports', 'Sports Medicine', 'Stress', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral plasticity', 'complex biological systems', 'data fusion', 'environmental change', 'fitness', 'healthy lifestyle', 'improved', 'indexing', 'injured', 'injury prevention', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'medical specialties', 'mixed reality', 'multimodal data', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'precision genetics', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'stem', 'success', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult', 'young man', 'young woman']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2020,312918,0.005074299370584752
"Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease Project Summary Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent in the U.S. population and is a major cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease morbidity, and mortality. Current gaps exist in characterizing the heterogeneity of CKD population. Obesity further increases the risks of adverse outcomes among people with impaired kidney function. However, the mechanism between obesity and CKD is not fully understood, and numerous studies have observed “obesity paradox” or survival advantage being associated with higher body fat among advanced CKD patients. In this context, the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study provides an ideal opportunity to study the mechanism of CKD with its rich clinical information and population characteristics, as well as its availability of non-targeted high-dimensional metabolomics data. To better understand the “adiposity-obesity-related” (AOR) mechanisms of CKD and to discover novel biomarkers, we propose to identify distinct subgroups based on AOR attributes and to perform metabolomics analysis on the identified subgroups and CKD outcomes. The overall goal of this research and the training plan is to execute three studies as the subjects of a doctoral dissertation in metabolomics analysis and CKD epidemiology. First, in Aim 1, we will identify latent AOR subgroups in the CRIC CKD population using the data-driven approach of consensus clustering. We will also evaluate the utility and the independent risk discrimination performance of the AOR subgroups with key CKD outcomes (CKD progression, CVD, and death), using Cox regression model with adjustment for known CKD risk factors. Next, in Aim 2, we will perform metabolomics analysis and identify metabolites and metabolomic patterns that are associated with the different AOR subgroups. In response to the statistical challenges in analyzing the high-dimensional metabolomics data, we will implement both the machine learning random-forest algorithm and the conventional univariate and multivariate regression analysis. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the relationship between CKD outcomes and the metabolites and metabolomic patterns identified in Aim 2, using Cox regression model, extended by pathway analysis and mediation analysis. Mining high-dimensional metabolomics data with AOR phenotypes in the CRIC Study holds promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD. Future studies can be built upon these findings to improve more effective and personalized CKD management in the setting of the obesity epidemic. A rigorous curriculum including didactic and experiential learning in biomedical data mining, statistics, and advanced epidemiology will round out the applicant's training, preparing her to be an independent and collaborative investigator and a kidney disease epidemiologist at the completion of his PhD. Project Narrative Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its risk factors of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are prevalent in the United States. To better understand the mechanism between adiposity-obesity-related CKD mechanism, the proposed research will implement machine learning algorithms, and identify distinct patient subgroups and discover novel CKD biomarkers, using the clinical and high-dimensional metabolomics data from a diverse cohort of CKD patients. The findings of our study hold promise to expand our knowledge of pathophysiology and molecular characterization of CKD, and facilitate personalized disease management.",Adiposity-obesity-related subgroups discovery and metabolomics analysis for chronic kidney disease,9964494,F31DK122683,"['Active Learning', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body fat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Impairment', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Kynurenine', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome Assessment', 'PTH gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Specimen', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Troponin T', 'Tryptophan', 'United States', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'patient subsets', 'personalized management', 'population based', 'preservation', 'random forest', 'response', 'statistics', 'targeted biomarker', 'tool']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2020,45520,-0.0398816496356719
"Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images ABSTRACT The goal of this R03 Small Grant Program for NIDDK is to provide additional funding for Dr. Kline to expand upon his work on his K award and apply his expertise to new image acquisitions and problems related to renal imaging. Dr. Kline’s work has piqued the interest of many internal and external investigators and has led to recent collaborations with Drs. Rule, Denic, and Kim. Together with Dr. Erickson, this new research team has prepared this R03 proposal which takes advantage of the unique expertise of each team member. The focus of this proposal is to bridge the gap between microscopic observations and those assessable non-invasively by radiological imaging. To do this, we have established a unique dataset of renal CT imaging data and corresponding biopsy measured nephron densities. We have also generated a large database of gold-standard segmentation data of kidneys, cortical regions, and medullary pyramids. Using this existing data, we propose to: (i) develop tools for segmentation of kidneys, segmentation of individual medullary pyramids, and imputing missing parts of the kidneys outside of the imaged field-of-view in the CT image, and (ii) to establish imaging biomarkers of early CKD, and correlate macroscopic imaging findings to underlying microscopic structure. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Aging Kidney Anatomy Study (PI: Rule), which led to the generation of this unique and well characterized dataset. Dr. Kline’s background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly well suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, near the end of this research project Dr. Kline will submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of renal imaging biomarkers. Obtaining this R03 Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline’s transition into a prosperous independent researcher focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. Narrative Non-invasive methods for characterizing micro-structural changes of the kidney during aging as well as in health and disease are currently not possible. This research program proposes to use our existing database of renal imaging and renal biopsy data to bridge the gap between macroscopic radiological findings on computed tomography images to those assessable in microscopic images of renal biopsies. This program will develop new automated methods for performing measurements on the images, as well as use machine/deep learning methods to search for new imaging biomarkers that relate to nephron density and size, as well as establish their usefulness for early chronic kidney disease detection and transplant planning.",Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images,10040835,R03DK125632,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Albuminuria', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Award', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrons', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early detection biomarkers', 'graft failure', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'living kidney donor', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technology', 'personalized decision', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2020,113350,0.011284191047240582
"Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction Project Summary Electronic health records (EHR) provide rich source of data about representative populations and are yet to be fully utilized to enhance clinical decision-making. Conventional approaches in clinical decision-making start with the identification of relevant biomarkers based on subject-matter knowledge, followed by detailed but limited analysis using these biomarkers exclusively. As the current scientific literature indicates, many human disorders share a complex etiological basis and exhibit correlated disease progression. Therefore, it is desirable to use comprehensive patient data for patient similarity. This proposal focuses on deriving a comprehensive and integrated score of patient similarity from complete patient characteristics currently available, including but not limited to 1) demographic similarity; 2) genetic similarity; 3) clinical phenotype similarity; 4) treatment similarity; and 5) exposome similarity (here exposome defined as all available attributes of the living environment an individual is exposed to), when some of the aspects may overlap and interact. We will optimize information fusion and task-dependent feature selection for assessing patient similarity for clinical risk prediction. Since currently there does not exist a pipeline that is able to extract executable complete patient determinant data, to achieve the research goal described above, we propose first deliver an open- source data preparation pipeline that is based on a widely used clinical data standard, the OMOP (Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership) Common Data Model (CMD) version 5.2. Moreover, to mitigate common missingness and sparsity challenges in clinical data, we describe the first attempt to represent patients' sparse clinical information with missingness, including diagnosis information, medication data, treatment intervention, with a fixed-length feature vector (i.e. the Patient2Vec). This project has four specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop a clinical data processing pipeline for harmonizing patient information from multiple sources into a standards-based uniformed data representation and to evaluate its efficiency, interoperability, and accuracy. Aim 2 is to leverage a powerful machine learning technique, Document2Vec, from the natural language processing literature, to create an open-source Patient2Vec framework for the derivation of informative numerical representations of patients. Aim 3 is to develop a unified machine learning clinical- outcome-prediction framework for Optimized Patient Similarity Fusion (OptPSF) that integrates traditional medical covariates with the derived numerical patient representations from Patient2Vec (Aim 2) for improved clinical risk prediction. Aim 4 is to evaluate our similarity framework for predicting 1) the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in general EHR patient population and 2) the risk of death among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The project focus on developing a novel data science pipeline which includes a clinical data processing pipeline to format comprehensive patient health determinants from a variety of sources of clinical, genomic, socioenvironmental data, and a clinical-outcome-prediction framework that optimally fuses relevant patient health determinants to define patient similarity for improved clinical risk predictions.",Big Data Methods for Comprehensive Similarity based Risk Prediction,9870948,R01LM013061,"['Address', 'Automation', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biometry', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Social Environment', 'Source', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data modeling', 'data standards', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'feature selection', 'health data', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'socioeconomics', 'support tools', 'vector']",NLM,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,420434,-0.013966119025326391
"Artificial Intelligence to Predict Outcomes in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects up to half of critically ill patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). In patients with AKI and hemodynamic instability, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred dialysis modality for solute and volume control. ICU mortality in this vulnerable population is high (~75%) but kidney recovery occurs in up to two-thirds of survivors. Fluid overload is a potentially modifiable risk factor associated with these outcomes. However, there are currently no universally accepted approaches for predicting kidney recovery, survival or individual response to fluid removal during CRRT. Due to recent advances in computer science and widespread big data usage, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a valuable approach. DL allows construction of risk prediction models using time-series data that incorporate thousands of variables and dynamic changes in these variables derived from multi-dimensional sources and not only static values of these variables. We propose to develop and validate innovative DL approaches to dynamically predict these outcomes using multi-modal data from electronic health records and CRRT machines. We demonstrated superiority of DL models without a-priori variable selection compared to optimized logistic regression (C-Statistic of 0.72 vs. 0.62) for prediction of RRT liberation. We also showed that mortality prediction improved by incorporating changes in clinical data within 6-hour intervals after CRRT initiation. In addition, we identified distinctive mortality risk according to quintiles of achieved net ultrafiltration rates, after adjustment by patient’s weight, duration of CRRT, and other clinical parameters: OR 8.0 (95% CI: 2.7-25.1) when the highest quintile (>36 ml/kg/day) was compared to the lowest quintile (<13 ml/kg/day). We hypothesize that innovative DL approaches integrating time- series data will generate accurate and generalizable risk prediction models that can impact CRRT delivery. We will utilize a multi-institutional dataset that encompasses clinical data and CRRT programmatic and therapy data (CRRTnet registry, n=1500 patients) for model development and an independent multi-institutional dataset for validation (n=1500 patients) to: 1) continuously predict short-term (7-day) and medium-term (28-day) liberation from RRT due to kidney recovery; 2) continuously predict 24-hour mortality; and 3) identify and validate sub- phenotypes of patients with AKI on CRRT with differing achieved net ultrafiltration rates. This innovative research will assist 1) the development of novel clinical decision support platforms for guiding informed CRRT delivery and promoting kidney recovery; 2) the identification of sub-phenotypes of patients that can benefit from precision- medicine approaches to fluid removal during CRRT; and 3) the design of interventional studies focusing on fluid removal during CRRT to impact patient-centered outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is the preferred dialysis treatment for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury and hemodynamic instability, yet mortality is high (~75%). Presently, there are no universally accepted approaches for predicting kidney recovery, survival or individual response to fluid removal during CRRT. We propose to develop and validate innovative deep learning approaches to dynamically predict these outcomes, which could guide CRRT decision-making including intensification, de-escalation, and enrich clinical trials focusing on fluid removal during CRRT.",Artificial Intelligence to Predict Outcomes in Patients with Acute Kidney Injury on Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy,10261059,R56DK126930,"['Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Fluid overload', 'Goals', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hour', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Kidney', 'Liquid substance', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Survivors', 'Time', 'Ultrafiltration', 'Validation', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'electronic data', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual response', 'innovation', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'risk prediction model', 'solute', 'therapy design', 'time use']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R56,2020,100000,0.024488683142699526
"Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation Project Summary Candidate Goals and Objectives: With a background in Information Systems and Management, and Biostatistics, Dr. Zhang has demonstrated research records on electronic health record data mining to identify patterns of healthcare delivery that may be used to inform patient-centered and evidence-based healthcare. The proposal will provide additional training for Dr. Zhang on advanced machine learning, statistics, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics for applications on clinical decision support (CDS). Dr. Zhang's long-term goal is to bringing innovation CDS development and evaluation through novel biomedical informatics and data science techniques. Institutional Environment and Career Development: Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) provides ideal research facilities and training environment for Dr. Zhang. Dr. Jyotishman Pathak, Chief of Division of Health Informatics at Department of Health Policy and Research, will lead a multidisciplinary team of mentors: Drs. Jessica Ancker and Fei Wang at WCM, and Dr. Adam Wright at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Zhang also has collaborators in WCM and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who will support her in her training and research activities and provide clinical expertise. Research Aims Order sets are a type of CDS in computerized provider order entry (CPOE) to standardize decision making in the ordering process and encourage compliance with clinical practice guidelines. Previous literature on order set use has focused its effect on usability, workload, and physician satisfaction, but a knowledge gap remains with respect to the effect of order sets on care outcomes. The overall goal of the research study is to create a continuous improvement cycle for order sets with respect to a care outcome by rigorously learning from data. Aim 1 of the study will apply computational phenotyping and subtyping algorithms to identify cohorts of heart failure (HF) subtypes. Aim 2 will evaluate an existing order set intended for the care of HF patients on a care outcome defined as 30-day all-cause, unplanned readmission with a hypothesis that the use of this order set is associated with a better outcome. This will be achieved by building a range of outcome prediction models and evaluating the strength of each order set order as a predictor. Aim 3 will optimize the existing order sets using a metaheuristic optimization method such that its content collectively may have the largest positive effect on the outcome of 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The effects of order set use on the care outcome is measured using a causal inference technique in each iteration. The expected outcome is a framework to develop and evaluate HF order sets which may eventually be generalized to other clinical areas. Training from this proposal may lead to multi-site R01 studies of outcome-driven HF order sets and actual implementations. Project Narrative In this study, we propose a continuous improvement cycle to develop, manage, and evaluate outcome-driven order sets, a type of clinical decision support (CDS) for computerized provider order entry (CPOE). Mentorship and training include advanced statistics, machine learning, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics. The proposed research will leverage the principal investigator (PI)'s background in methodology development and health information systems to provide the PI with additional training to innovate outcome-driven CDS for CPOE.","Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation",10018097,K01LM013257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health Information System', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Management', 'Information Systems', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care outcomes', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computerized', 'computerized physician order entry', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health care delivery', 'health care service organization', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'long short term memory', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilayer perceptron', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'personalized decision', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'research facility', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'social health determinants', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K01,2020,180368,-0.032460208935717355
"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9942528,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,559900,-0.05134838298596642
"Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs Project Abstract for HealthTech Solutions Kidney transplantation is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes. Twenty-two patients die each day waiting for a transplant and 30% of all deaths in the US could be prevented by organ transplant. Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effective advantages of kidney transplantation, there has been a decades-long rise in the kidney discard rate from 5.1% in 1988 to 19.2% in 2015. During a successful Phase I grant and to address the need for a dedicated communications system to help improve transplant patient outcomes and achieve greater donated organ utilization, HealthTech Solutions (HTS), Inc. developed a proprietary mobile application for secure team communication tailored specifically for kidney transplant teams. To further improve communication efficiency and augment critical decision making in healthcare, specifically for surgeons, HTS will employ machine learning (ML) powered clinical decision support. Clinical decision support (CDS) may significantly increase access, increase quality, and reduce the cost of kidney transplantation. The proposed project is designed to further test and quantify the improvement of the donor management, coordination process, and kidney utilization outcomes using the company’s CDS and communication infrastructure for medical team communication. The aims are; 1) Develop CDS models specifically for transplant professionals aimed at improving decision times and decision confidence. Develop the CDS infrastructure capable of handling medical data and serving insights safely, securely, and rapidly; 2) Asses usability by working with a test group to exceed usability criteria and ensure that CDS meets clinician needs through user feedback iterations. Verification of utility from a diversified testing group (n=10) that represent every type of professional involved in transplant cases. 3) Measure the effects of TXP Chat enhanced with CDS after live clinical implementation in the kidney offer and procurement processes for more than 3,000 offers (1,500 with CDS and 1,500 control) over a period of 365 days with multiple partner institutions (n=3). TXP Chat and CDS will demonstrate to be reliable, secure, trustworthy and useful by the clinical/technical community, increase kidney acceptance practices resulting in an increase in kidney transplants, reduction in cold ischemic time, and reduction in time from offer to transplant. Ultimately, these metrics have been demonstrated in the literature to improve patient outcomes, reduce expensive chronic treatment costs (e.g. dialysis), reduce patient deaths from lack of kidney availability, and significantly improve human health and productivity. Study results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aim 1 will lay the foundation for further development to enable wider CDS in the Phase IIB. Aim 2 will prove physician support and steady adoption trend as we roll into commercialization. Aim 3 will provide multi-center pilot study data used to prove increased efficiency of the process in terms of time, money, and total number of kidneys transplanted. Project Narrative Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effectiveness advantages of kidney transplantation for many patients, nearly 1 in 5 kidneys authorized for donation are discarded. This project addresses the need for an efficient communications software technology enhanced with clinical decision support tailored for organ procurement organizations and transplant centers. Combined with enhanced communication efficiency, clinical decision support powered by machine learning may significantly improve donated kidney utilization and increase the number of viable, but currently unused organs that could otherwise be successfully transplanted, reducing waste and saving lives.","Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs",10017295,R44LM012575,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Direct Costs', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Multiple Partners', 'Organ', 'Organ Procurements', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Renal Glycosuria', 'Reporting', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Cost', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'burnout', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'cohesion', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'operation', 'prevent', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'transmission process', 'transplant centers', 'trend', 'usability', 'wasting']",NLM,ORGANIZER,R44,2020,975104,0.029802532824400242
"Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Rationale. Diabetes is a leading cause of renal disease, accounting for 40% of the estimated 20 million US adult cases of chronic kidney disease. There is, however, substantial heterogeneity across diabetic patients with regards to development of kidney disease. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers that can provide early and reliable evidence of future kidney disease, so that high-risk patients can receive optimal medical care. Existing clinical, proteomic and genomic markers do not consistently nor accurately predict kidney function decline. Metabolomics, a systematic evaluation of the end-products of cellular function in fluids, has the potential to inform physiological and pathological effects of chronic diseases. Metabolomic analysis combined with advanced quantitative methods could play a key role in building clinically useful prognostic signatures of diabetic kidney disease. Yet, development of computational methods with adequate rigor has lagged behind the technical capacity to perform large scale quantitative metabolomics. In this proposal we aim to address this computational gap in diabetic kidney disease research. Aims. We will implement rigorous computational methods to identify robust prognostic metabolite + clinical + genetic signatures of diabetic kidney disease progression. Specifically, we aim to (i) test the accuracy of previous signatures, and apply state-of-the-art analytic techniques and novel statistical methods to identify new multivariate metabolite sets for predicting kidney disease progression; (ii) quantify patterns of co-regulation of metabolites in diabetic kidney disease, and develop new tools in network biology to discover novel enzymes, proteins, metabolites, and molecular pathways which are implicated in diabetic kidney disease progression; (iii) test if these models can accurately predict kidney disease progression in independent prospective cohorts. Methods. Using clinical, genetic and metabolomic data from large prospective cohorts of > 1200 diverse, well- characterized patients with Type 2 diabetes, we will apply statistical methods for variable selection (e.g., penalized regression), and machine learning methods (e.g., random forest), which are known to perform well in the high-dimensional setting, to identify robust and parsimonious signatures of kidney disease progression. We will quantify inter-metabolite co-regulation patterns and infer biological pathways implicated in diabetic kidney disease. Throughout the modeling process, a rigorous training-validation paradigm will be adopted in order to improve reproducibility of models and reduce chance findings. Impact. A major product of this work will be the development of a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline. Our findings will also provide insight into markers of renal dysfunction, and elucidate possible therapeutic targets for treating diabetic kidney disease, thus potentially informing the design of future clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Kidney disease, a major and common complication of diabetes, can lead to repeated hospitalizations and premature death. There is an urgent need to develop clinical tools that can provide early evidence that a given diabetic patient is likely to progress to kidney disease in the future. In this proposal, we will identify new urinary biomarkers and use novel statistical modeling methods to create a clinically useful algorithm for identifying diabetic patients at high-risk for kidney function decline, with the ultimate goal of improving disease management and reducing mortality rates for these patients.",Developing and validating prognostic metabolomic signatures of diabetic kidney disease,9923450,R01DK110541,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pima Indian', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Type 2 diabetic', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological heterogeneity', 'chemical association', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'genetic signature', 'genomic biomarker', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney dysfunction', 'machine learning method', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'model development', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'nephrogenesis', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive test', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'random forest', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'urinary']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2020,334508,-0.006754053504651251
"A new approach to predict graft outcome from histology in children undergoing kidney transplantation using machine learning methods Abstract Although the overall renal graft survival has dramatically improved over the last several decades, almost half of pediatric patients lose their transplant within 10 years. Epidemiology, immunology and histology are all key elements in understanding post-transplant complications and in predicting clinical outcomes, however accurate prediction of transplant outcomes remains challenging and understudied among pediatric kidney transplant recipients. Machine learning technology is rapidly advancing and has demonstrated remarkable predictive accuracy surpassing classical predictive models in several biomedical applications. The goal of this research proposal is to develop machine learning methods to improve prediction of transplant outcomes through analysis of histology, assemble data sufficient to describe the incidence of different types of rejection and histological findings on pediatric kidney transplant biopsies, and to assess their impact on graft outcome. To achieve these goals, we will assemble an international multicenter cohort of over 700 pediatric kidney transplant recipients and develop and validate machine-learning models combining clinical, immunological and histological data for predicting short-term pediatric graft outcomes. This study will enable accurate, reproducible, and standardized assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and provide a new method to predict graft outcome. This will pave the way to future large, prospective study assessing the feasibility and potential impact of machine-learning methods in transplant biopsy analysis, with the goal of improving clinical management and resource utilization by identifying patients with high risk of graft loss. Finally, this study will provide critical information for efficient and effective design of clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of pediatric kidney transplant recipients, with an emphasis on individualized treatment. Project Narrative: Accurate prediction of graft outcome in pediatric kidney transplant patients is critical to individualize patients' management and treatment and to design efficient and effective clinical trials focused on improving outcomes of these patients. Our long-term goal is to improve the assessment of histopathological findings in pediatric transplant recipients and create a new systematic methodology to predict graft outcomes that can be applied nationally and internationally.

"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,9856147,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data Methods', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'convolutional neural network', 'data exploration', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'large datasets', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neural network', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,309176,-0.036640708623114235
"Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches Summary: There is an urgent need for an automated decision support system for diagnosis and prognosis of traumatic brain injuries (TBI). TBI is one of the leading causes of death in the modern world, and substantially contributes to disability and impairment. The early detection of TBI and its proper management presents an unfilled need. We therefore aim to supplement clinicians' decisions by developing a decision support system for monitoring and integrating available information of a TBI patient for accurate and quantitative diagnosis and prognosis. This project is the main component of a long-term goal of building a system that creates personalized treatment plans. Specifically, we intend to automatically detect and accurately quantify two critical abnormalities including shift in the brain's middle structure (Aim 1) and intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 2) from computed tomography (CT) head scans. In Aim 1, we develop a model for delineating the spatial shift in brain structure and its predictive power. We employ anatomical landmarks to detect a 3D deformed surface of the brain midline after TBI. Such an approach allows us to quantify the shifted volume, a measurement that is not currently achievable. Additionally, it provides accurate and timely access to conventional midline shift in a 2D CT slice. In Aim 2, we build a model for delineating intracranial hemorrhage and its predictive power. We implement a 3D convolutional neural network model to detect hemorrhagic regions and quantify and localize their volume. Currently, these measurements are inaccurate and not readily available due to the cumbersome manual process; instead a lesion's thickness in a 2D CT slice is used to assess its severity. In both Aim 1 and 2, we automatically calculate conventional and proposed volumetric and locational measurements and compare them to suggest the best diagnostic metric for each abnormality. Finally, in Aim 3, we build an automated pipeline for TBI severity assessment and outcome prediction. To this end, manual CT scan reads will be integrated with patient-level information available from electronic health records to achieve accurate data-driven diagnosis and prognosis. We implement machine learning approaches to build models capable of predicting short and long-term clinical outcomes. Our prediction models will be developed independently of our image processing algorithms. Upon achievement of Aims 1 and 2, automatically calculated information from CT scans will be incorporated into machine learning models. The proposed research is significant, because it is expected to advance TBI care, specifically within the “golden hour"" post-injury. Ultimately, such a system has the potential to reduce delayed and missed diagnosis, thereby reducing TBI morbidity and mortality. Additionally, by preventing permanent and/or secondary injuries, and minimizing the time of hospitalization and rehabilitation, our system will contribute to reducing the annual $76 billion burden of TBI care in the U.S. In addition to innovation in the proposed approaches and their quantitative outputs, we aggregate four existing datasets to incorporate heterogeneity in both phenotypes and therapies, so the resulted model will be generalizable and applicable to real clinical settings. Project Narrative: Traumatic brain injury, frequently referred to as a silent epidemic, involves about 1.7 million people in the U.S, among whom 50,000 will die, while 152,000 will suffer from long-term disability and impairment. The proposed research will automatically diagnose and assess the severity of critical abnormalities from computed tomography head scan, and integrate all available sources of clinical data using data science methods to make a personalized data-driven prognosis. It is expected that this technology will provide caregivers with critical information for early and proper management of injuries, thus saving lives and improving the quality of life of survivors by reducing second/permanent injuries; importantly, this system would enable people living in outlying and deprived regions lacking skilled clinicians benefit from more accurate diagnostics, and as a result, a better care.",Automated Decision Support System for Traumatic Brain Injury through Image Processing and Machine Learning Approaches,9989634,F31LM012946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Achievement', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemic', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'Visual', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'care costs', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disability', 'functional outcomes', 'human error', 'image processing', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treatment planning']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2020,38064,0.005269188579719473
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10003227,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,506170,0.020923516294918773
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,9971553,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2020,119199,0.0038539597902712964
"Enhanced Diagnosis of Antibody-Mediated Kidney Rejection by Machine Learning and Hybrid Targeted-Shotgun Proteomics Kidney transplantation offers the best quality of life for patients with chronic kidney failure. Antibody and T-cell mediated rejection (ABMR and TCMR) are key factors that determine graft survival. Currently, the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rejection relies on histopathologic examination which has known limitations such as subjective interpretations, limited reproducibility, and the need for expert transplant pathologists. There is an unmet need to develop more specific and quantitative molecular tests that can complement and enhance conventional histologic assessment. Among the molecular assays, proteome profiling is more attractive than genomic and transcriptomic profiling which are subjected to numerous post-translational and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, morphologic changes form the basis of classifying different allograft diseases. Therefore, the transplant community needs to invest in biopsy-based assays in addition to the blood/urine-based assays that are being developed by others. This study is aimed to fully map the proteomic changes in routinely processed formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies using a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) platform. To meet the needs of personalized medicine, this platform uses a novel strategy and machine learning to simultaneously measure the absolute expression levels of a panel of targeted biomarkers as well as thousands of untargeted proteins. The central hypothesis is that LC-MS/MS can be used to define disease-specific biomarkers using a discovery data set, which can then be followed up by a validation data set to determine if LC-MS/MS based tests can be implemented in clinical practice. In the current project, we will focus on developing molecular assays for ABMR since antibody contributes to graft loss in 60% of patients. Two Aims are proposed. In Aim #1, quantitative proteomic strategies will be used to map proteome-level changes in a discovery set of biopsies with ABMR and its mimics, such as acute tubular injury (ATI), TCMR, BK virus nephropathy (BKVN), interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), and stable renal function (STA). The goal is to identify potential protein biomarkers that can distinguish ABMR from its mimics. In Aim #2, the potential ABMR biomarkers obtained in Aim #1 will be validated and optimized in an independent validation data set. Using a hybrid proteomic platform combing targeted, shotgun proteomics and machine learning, information on absolute quantitation of potential protein biomarkers and thousands of other proteins will be collected to build a kidney transplant Protein Atlas for assay development. Successful completion of this study has great potential to be translated into clinical tests that will enhance the diagnosis of ABMR from other diseases that can mimic that pathology. It will also serve as a model for developing a new generation of clincal diagnositc tests that will use routinely fixed biopsy materials. This will eliminate the need for intense biobanking efforts, which have hampered the more widespread implementation of molecular diagnostics into the transplant clinic. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is aimed at devising more accurate and reliable tests for diagnosing rejection of transplanted kidneys. Better tests will lead to more effective treatment, prolong graft life, and improve the quality of life for patients with chronic kidney failure.",Enhanced Diagnosis of Antibody-Mediated Kidney Rejection by Machine Learning and Hybrid Targeted-Shotgun Proteomics,10055012,R21AI148776,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Atlases', 'Atrophic', 'BK Virus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Comb animal structure', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fibrosis', 'Formalin', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hybrids', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Testing', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Reaction', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'assay development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'burden of illness', 'candidate marker', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'complement C4d', 'cost', 'design', 'differential expression', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'histological specimens', 'histopathological examination', 'improved', 'interstitial', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'molecular diagnostics', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'proteomic signature', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'synthetic peptide', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'targeted biomarker', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2020,234008,-0.003369618862866493
"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment.

Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,10250778,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'fractionated radiation', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,H.

"Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Critically injured patients have a four-fold higher risk of death from medical errors than other hospitalized patients, with nearly half of preventable deaths related to errors during the initial resuscitation phase. Although protocols, simulation, and leadership training improve team performance in this setting, as many as 12 protocol deviations per resuscitation have been observed, even with experienced teams. Given adverse outcomes that can result from performance gaps, there is a critical need to establish novel approaches for applying real-time decision support in critical-care settings. The long-term goal is to implement decision support for trauma resuscitation and other fast-paced, high-risk critical care settings that improves performance, reduces errors, and prevents adverse outcomes. The overall objective for this renewal is to vertically advance what was achieved during the first funding period by designing, implementing and testing an intention-aware recommender system that (1) recognizes and tracks current goals using sensor data, the output from patient monitors, and data captured from digital devices, (2) derives recommendations that support adherence to goal- based protocols, and (3) displays these recommendations in real time on wall displays. The central hypothesis is that decision support aligning with intentions (“intended” or “current” goals) will enhance protocol compliance, leading to improved outcomes related to trauma resuscitation. The rationale for this renewal is that recommendations supporting protocol compliance that are aligned with team intentions are more likely to be adopted by being less distracting and associated with lower cognitive load. Guided by preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) design and implement an automated real- time approach for predicting and monitoring the assessment and treatment goals of trauma resuscitation; and 2) generate and display a recommended plan of activities that supports current goal pursuit during trauma resuscitation. For the first Aim, machine learning approaches will be applied for recognizing goals using data obtained from sensors and other digital data sources. Under the second Aim, a machine learning strategy will be implemented and tested that generates recommendations responsive to team intentions. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on development of real-time methods that integrate goals as an input for making recommendations that meet the most current and relevant information needs. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve the care of severely injured and other critically ill patients by promoting timely and appropriate achievement of critical assessment and treatment goals in settings that remain at high-risk for medical errors. The results of this research continuum are expected to have an important positive impact on the outcome by addressing the mismatch between complex decision-making and human vulnerability to error that remain in critical care settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is relevant to public health because it focuses on the design and implementation of a novel real-time decision support system that will reduce errors associated with adverse patient outcomes by providing recommendations that support the current information needs of multidisciplinary trauma teams. The proposed project is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission related to development of biomedical communications systems, methods, and technologies, and information dissemination and utilization among health professionals.",Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes,9932473,R01LM011834,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Information Dissemination', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'simulation', 'success']",NLM,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,658135,-0.005610479375460974
"DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation Contact PD/PI: Fereidouni, Farzad Abstract Kidneys, like other organs, have an inherent capacity to recover from acute injury; however, severe or recurrent injury can result in chronic kidney disease (CKD), the sequelae of which result in 82,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Regardless of the etiology of the initial injury, the common final pathway leading to- end stage renal disease is closely connected to fibrosis(excess or aberrant collagen distribution), one of the most important determinants of renal disease severity and prognosis. Histology is the gold standard for evaluation, typically through the use of histochemical stains such as trichrome and PAS that highlight the presence of collagens and basement membrane, respectively. Nevertheless, these stains are not completely specific, can be technically challenging to perform well and reproducibly, and thus contribute to interobserver variability and a concomitant decrease in diagnostic precision. Moreover, they also require the preparation of extra slides and additional staining procedures, and thus increase cost and can prolong the diagnostic process. We propose to optimize, deploy and test a new kind of microscope, DUET (DUal mode Emission and Transmission microscopy), developed at UC Davis, that will be a low-cost and very rapid solution for detection and digital characterization of the presence and distribution of collagen and other macromolecules, directly from standard formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. Specifically, we will finalize the design of the hardware and software components of the instrument itself, validate imaging performance against standard histology and immunohistochemical stains for collagen and other components, and with the assistance of scientists at our partnering institutions (John Hopkins University and University of Buffalo) develop robust tools for analysis and quantitation of fibrosis. DUET instrument hardware will be shared with JHU to ensure that the methods are technically reproducible across multiple sites. The application leverages the expertise across three institutions in optics, biomedical engineering, renal pathology and novel artificial intelligence approaches. The goal of the project is development and validation of DUET, which promises to be a robust, inexpensive and practical approach for the rapid and accurate evaluation of fibrosis, extensible to other renal pathologies, and indeed across other organs systems, with significant positive impact on disease research, clinical practice, and patient outcomes. Page 6 Project Summary/Abstract Project Narrative Evaluation of fibrosis and tubular atrophy from chemically stained kidney biopsies are essential for diagnosis and disease-severity assessment, but current techniques are time-consuming, somewhat non-specific and contribute to interobserver variability and imprecision, affecting care. We propose to optimize and test a new kind of microscope (“DUET”) that can visualize fibrosis (scarring) and other tissue abnormalities directly from standard slides to enable high-quality reproducible fibrosis scoring and evaluation. This multi-site project will also provide a unique opportunity to perform a retrospective study from hundreds of existing H&E slides with associated months to years of clinical follow-up data, and to create a method with demonstrated utility in more than one institution.",DUET: Rapid dual-mode microscopy for quantitative slide-based renal fibrosis evaluation,10261643,R56DK124873,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrophic', 'Basement membrane', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Buffaloes', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fibrillar Collagen', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence', 'Formalin', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Natural History', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Microscopy', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirius Red F3B', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissues', 'Trichrome stain method', 'Tubular formation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'histological stains', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney fibrosis', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'software development', 'stem', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R56,2020,91725,0.017665470362996226
"Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted by a pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist committed to improving the quality of patient-oriented research for patients experiencing acute respiratory failure (ARF). Worldwide, millions of patients develop ARF annually. In the U.S., nearly one million patients with ARF require mechanical ventilation annually, accounting for a quarter of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. As improvements in ICU care reduce such patients’ in-hospital mortality rates, attention has shifted to the challenges ARF survivors face in regaining their prior cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning. However, there is a key barrier for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) testing new interventions to improve ARF survivorship – that is, the current lack of an endpoint that (1) captures long-term patient dispositions, (2) incorporates patient preferences and perspectives, and (3) is able to be analyzed without concern for statistical biases. The overarching goal of this research is to support clinical innovation by developing new approaches to measure and report long-term patient-centered outcomes that overcome the methodological barriers currently limiting ARF RCTs. The applicant will accomplish his goals under the mentorship of established researchers in critical care, patient-centered outcomes research, statistics, and informatics to assure his transition to a tenure-track faculty position in the R00 phase and his emergence as a leading pulmonary and critical care epidemiologist. First, the applicant will use an innovative combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods to elicit and integrate ARF survivors’ and their caregivers’ perspectives into a new patient-centered, long-term composite outcome measure (K99 phase). During the R00 phase, the applicant will recruit ARF survivors to participate in a prospective cohort, and follow these patients to describe the burden of ARF survivorship over 1-year using the new endpoint developed during the K99 phase. This endeavor will also provide key data that will facilitate sample size calculations in future ARF RCTs. Data from this cohort will additionally be used to develop an electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithm to predict risks for adverse long-term outcomes among ARF patients early in their ICU stays. Thus, this K99/R00 will augment ARF research by establishing a new outcome measure anchored in patient perspectives, improving the understanding and clinical prognostication of post-ICU morbidity following ARF, and facilitate the efficiency and clinical relevance of future ARF RCTs by enabling measurement of patients’ baseline risks for different outcomes. Concurrently, the didactic work, individual study, and hands-on learning in mixed-methods research, natural language processing, and predictive analytics will fill key training gaps for the applicant, thereby positioning him for a successful, independently-funded research career advancing the science of outcomes measurement and analysis for ARF RCTs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Randomized trials testing strategies to improve long-term outcomes for survivors of acute respiratory failure (ARF) are hampered by the lack of valid, patient-centered endpoints. Using interviews with ARF survivors and their caregivers, statistical simulation, consensus building among stakeholders, and a prospective cohort study, the applicant will develop, describe the epidemiology of, and predict a new patient-oriented outcome that will support trials of innovative approaches to improve ARF survivorship outcomes.","Improving the measurement and analysis of long-term, patient-centered outcomes following acute respiratory failure",9967226,R00HL141678,"['Accounting', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physical Function', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rogaine', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Statistical Bias', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'residence', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'survivorship', 'tenure track', 'unstructured data', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R00,2020,249000,-0.008204114003374346
"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,9892671,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,183209,0.02545895072847759
"Predictive Analytics in Hemodialysis: Enabling Precision Care for Patient with ESKD ABSTRACT End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies, with 25% dying within 1 year and 41% surviving at least 5 years. While providers recognize that patients are different – and ought to be differently – there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy and aid in treatment individualization. Instead, providers are left with often unclear or incomplete guidelines on how best to manage patients. In order to provide precision care for patients on hemodialysis (HD), there is a critical need to be able to (1) dynamically assess life expectancy for medical decision-making; and (2) identify distinct clinical phenotypes to enhance clinical monitoring and care planning. Our central hypothesis is that there is heterogeneity in patient survivorship and disease trajectory that, when known, can be used to provide more personalized and effective care. By coupling novel machine learning approaches for survival prediction with granular clinical data on HD patients, we will be able to develop the analytic tools necessary to support precision care. At the completion of this proposal we will have tools to dynamically assess a patient's life expectancy and insights into heterogeneous disease phenotypes for patients with ESKD. These tools will allow providers to make informed treatment decisions as well as lay the groundwork for further precision research into optimized patient care. NARRATIVE End stage kidney disease (ESKD) is a complex disease with individuals having variable life- expectancies. However, there are no tools to reliably forecast individual life expectancy.

"Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI PROJECT SUMMARY Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has complex profiles of co-occurring medical conditions (comorbidities) and is associated with high risk of suicide, particularly among Veterans, in which it is a leading cause of death. There is a critical lack of advancement in PTSD pharmacotherapy, as illustrated by increased use of off-label medications and polypharmacy (multiple drugs used simultaneously). The consequent limited evidence on the relative risks and benefits of treatments creates a crisis in PTSD management. Moreover, PTSD and its major comorbidities [traumatic brain injury (TBI) and suicidality] often remain undocumented in electronic health records (EHR). There is also poor predictability of disease outcomes since there are frequent changes in pharmacological treatment and multiple modifying comorbidities. Our long-term goal is to improve diagnostics, secondary/tertiary prevention, and treatment outcomes of PTSD and its comorbidities via enhanced EHR utilization. To achieve our objectives, we will analyze EHR and administrative claims data from Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases, collectively covering >2M PTSD and >2M TBI patients. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Identify undetected PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from EHRs (using machine learning with and without natural language language processing) to guide health service improvements. (2) Predict PTSD clinical course in the VA population through novel modeling of disease trajectories that account for time-varying treatments and biases (3) Compare the effectiveness of PTSD psychotropic monotherapies, polypharmacy, and psychotherapy to guide the choice of treatment for improved patient outcomes. By enhancing and validating a machine learning approach developed by our team, we will impute unrecorded PTSD, TBI, and self-harm from both datasets, and characterize factors associated with documentation disparities. We will model diseases trajectories with enhanced latent class analysis, focusing on self-harm, substance misuse, and psychiatric hospitalization in PTSD. With Local Control methodology innovations, we will compare the risk of PTSD in veterans with and without comorbid TBI. Finally, we will perform the largest comparative effectiveness studies (to date) of PTSD treatments on >100 monotherapy and polypharmacy regimens plus psychotherapy interventions. These studies will provide high-quality evidence on the risk of hospitalizations, substance misuse, and suicidal acts/self-harm. Successful completion of these investigations will improve the quality of decision making for providers and patients, and guide improved service delivery to the population of veterans and non-veterans with PTSD/TBI, and/or high risk of suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and its associated conditions (e.g., traumatic brain injury and suicidality) are often underdiagnosed, and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Treatment of PTSD often involves frequent treatment changes with multi-drug regimens (polypharmacy) and off-label medications for which the relative risks and benefits are largely unknown. To address these problems, we will develop and apply methods to identify undiagnosed patients, predict disease trajectories, and compare the effectiveness of all common PTSD treatments using health records from millions of patients in Veterans Administration (VA) and non-VA databases.",Deriving high-quality evidence from national healthcare databases to improve suicidality detection and treatment outcomes in PTSD and TBI,10088135,R56MH120826,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Documentation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'General Population', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Mental Illness', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Provider', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotherapy', 'Regimen', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Safety', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Source', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Veterans', 'analysis pipeline', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'compare effectiveness', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'health record', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'language processing', 'multiple drug use', 'natural language', 'novel', 'off-label drug', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'service delivery', 'sociodemographic factors', 'stress related disorder', 'substance misuse', 'suicidal act', 'suicidal risk', 'tertiary prevention', 'therapy design', 'time use', 'treatment choice', 'treatment comparison']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIS CTR,R56,2020,776198,-0.026278290559465962
"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio)statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field of health big data. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offers and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will primarily draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from three different departments within three different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science, Medicine, Population Health, Social and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including statistical modeling, data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high- dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and medical imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and success with the current summer program on Big Data led by this team with 164 students trained in the last 4 years (2015-2018) including 90 female students and 30 students from underrepresented minority groups. Fourteen of these participants from the last three years are currently graduate students in Michigan Biostatistics. The ongoing program has gained traction in the national landscape of summer research programs with 20% rate of admission and 80% rate of acceptance among those who are offered this opportunity. The program has consistently received very strong evaluation and our past alumni have become brand ambassadors and advocates for our program. We plan to build on the success and legacy of this program in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2019-2021). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a non-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 45 undergraduates nationally and internationally, with 20 domestic students supported by the requested SIBS funding mechanism and others supported by supplementary institutional and foundation support. We propose to expose the trainees to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of health Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. They will engage in mentored research projects in three primary areas of health big data: Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. Some of the projects will be defined in the area of cardiovascular precision medicine, defined by a team of highly quantitative researchers engaged in cardiovascular research that uses big data. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by U-M researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. We propose an inter-SIBS collaboration with Dordt College summer program trainees who will attend this concluding symposium. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world. We will offer multiple professional development opportunities and resources for graduate school preparation to our trainees so that they can reflect and plan beyond their senior year. All of our proposed activities are reflected through our three specific aims: Teaching, Mentoring and Dissemination. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a six week long undergraduate summer institute: “Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data” to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 45 undergraduate students recruited nationally and internationally, from 2019-2021. Funding is requested for 20 domestic students with supplementary funding expected to be garnered through institutional resources and private foundation support. The program builds on the success of our existing Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI) supported by a NIH BD2K Courses and Skills grant award that is ending in 2018. We plan to expose program students to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data and Human Health. We enhance our ongoing summer program structure in the current proposal by involving a team of researchers working at the intersection of cardiovascular research and data science with a focus on cardiovascular precision medicine where some of the new mentored research projects will be defined. We primarily focus on three genres of health Big Data arising in Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. The trainees will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty from Biostatistics, Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences, Epidemiology and Medicine, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by (U-M) researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a Wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material in this new field across the world.

"Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue globally, and while neuroimaging has been useful in understanding disruption in brain structure and function after injury, there are a number of factors that attenuate its prognostic ability. For example, there is tremendous heterogeneity in outcome after injury which is only partially explained by injury severity. Cost frequently limits sample size in neuroimaging studies, yet given the myriad factors that have been shown to influence patient outcome (age, injury severity, socioeconomic status), small samples and mass univariate testing often result in many studies being grossly under-powered. One solution is to combine data and create novel data sharing platforms, and the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium has supported this kind of collaboration for over a decade across a range of clinical disorders. The goal of this proposal is to develop tools and data processing procedures for use in the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group. In the R61 phase, we aim to develop and test a workflow for harmonized processing of behavioral data (Aim 1) as well as structural and functional (resting-state) MRI data (Aim 2). For Aim 1 of the R61, the goal is to offer a decision tree of procedures that is data-dependent, allowing investigators to establish common cognitive endpoints across cohorts that collect a range of neuropsychological and clinical measures. This proposal will create sharable procedures, flexible tools, and generalizable guidelines for best practices for extracting common cognitive endpoints from distinct behavioral test batteries (R61 Aim 1). In Aim 2 of the R61, we develop an image processing pipeline called Harmonization and Aggregation for Functional and structural imaging data PIPEline; HAF-PIPE) that allows for aggregation of non-equivalent imaging data. A primary goal is to decentralize ComBat, an open-source data harmonization tool, so that it can be used in a virtual sharing environment. Following satisfaction of the R61 Go/No-Go criteria, which is the curation of the dataset including 13 cohorts, extraction of common cognitive endpoints, and creation of HAF- PIPE, we will move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will leverage the large, harmonized dataset and apply a machine learning technique (CorEx - Correlation Explanation) to identify patient clusters within each patient population studied. HAF-PIPE and the procedures and guidelines from the R61 phase will then be extended to additional patient populations and made available to other ENIGMA working groups. The harmonized data, along with the tools and procedures for creating them, will be accessible to researchers following proposal submission and approval as a curated dataset. With success, this proposal holds the promise of significantly advancing data curation, harmonization, and sharing in the clinical neurosciences. We anticipate that our proposal will significantly advance our understanding of factors that impact outcome after injury and will yield a tool that will be useful across the neuroimaging community. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause widespread alteration in brain structure and function, but sample size in imaging studies is often limited, and differences in data acquisition and variables can create obstacles to data sharing. We propose to develop an open-source workflow for utilizing behavioral and MRI data that addresses these concerns and allows for harmonization across sites, supporting “big data” analyses that can identify clinically-meaningful patient subgroups in TBI, a goal that is not feasible with small datasets. Achieving the proposed Aims will make a curated and harmonized dataset available to the TBI community as well as procedures and data processing pipelines adaptable to other disorders in the clinical neurosciences.",Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative,10129715,R61NS120249,"['Address', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral construct', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'combat', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data curation', 'data harmonization', 'data ingestion', 'data pipeline', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'flexibility', 'heterogenous data', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'multimodal data', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'portability', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sharing platform', 'stroke recovery', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'working group']",NINDS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R61,2020,1015434,0.007086027631472565
"Modernizing Emergency Department Nurse Triage via Big Data Analytics PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Emergency department (ED) nurses triage over 136 million patients each year in the United States. The goal of triage is to assess and identify clinical conditions in order to prioritize those with the most significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Current practice uses the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) score to group patients by resource utilization. ESI has significant limitations including: racial bias, poor relation to patient-centered outcomes, subjectivity, and failure to differentiate acute patients (poor specificity). As such, the ESI tool fails to identify patient-specific factors, that are present at the time of triage, to accurately predict critical conditions requiring life-saving treatments. Due to its time sensitivity, complex symptomology, variable outcomes, and a national cost burden of $21 billion, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) will be used as an exemplar time-sensitive condition to develop a new predictive machine learning algorithm to be used for ED triage. Of 800,000 new annual ACS cases in the United States, nurses fail to identify approximately 50% during triage. This suggests an urgent need to develop triage tools, specifically ones that correctly identify ACS early, which could potentially reduce mortality by 10%-20%. This project proposes to use big data analytics to address the critical gaps of the ESI tool and nurse failure to identify ACS at triage. A large cohort of patients presenting to 17 different EDs with symptoms suspicious of ACS will be used to create a multidimensional database, extracting routinely collected patient factors from the electronic health record data acquired at initial nurse triage. This project will use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches that incorporate the complex interactions between patient factors to identify patients with true critical coronary occlusion that require time dependent treatment. The innovation of this study stems from having access to a world renowned academic medical center that is able to conduct full-scale studies using electronic health records of over 4.2 million patient encounters. This project aligns with the NINR’s strategic vision for nurses to use emerging technologies (big data) to predict patient trajectories, inform interventions and support real time clinical decision making. By using advanced machine learning concepts, we will translate our final machine model into a robust clinical tool to assist nurses in making real time clinical decisions to accurately identity ACS events and initiate timely treatment, thereby improving patient outcomes. Study findings have potential to change the paradigm of ED nurse triage to be more objective and data-driven, thereby recognizing critical conditions at initial triage and eliminating unnecessary morbidity and mortality. PROJECT NARRATIVE Emergency department nurses triage over 136 million patients a year, using the Emergency Severity Index score that has significant limitations and often fails to identify patients with critical time-sensitive conditions such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) approximately 50% of the time. To address these gaps, this project aims to develop a predictive algorithm using state-of-the-art machine learning concepts that incorporates the complex interactions between medical data available at nurse triage in order to identify patients with true critical coronary occlusion that requires time dependent treatment.

"Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and Recovery (Pred-MAKER) in COVID-19 Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  Major adverse kidney events (MAKE) are common in individuals hospitalized with COVID-19, particularly in the United States. Our data from Mount Sinai show that ~40% of hospitalized patients develop acute kidney injury (AKI); 20% of those need renal replacement therapy, and the mortality rate in patients that experience COVID-19 associated AKI is several-fold greater than patients without AKI. Furthermore, we have seen that the rate of non-recovery is also significantly higher compared to those observed in non-COVID AKI, highlighting the potential long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2-associated kidney damage. We propose to utilize the highly coordinated tissue and biospecimen collection machinery that has been initiated at the Mount Sinai Health System. As the largest hospital system at the epicenter of the crisis, Mount Sinai treated and discharged nearly 10,000 COVID-19 patients and created a central IRB approval and data coordination system under the auspices of the newly formed Mount Sinai COVID Informatics Center. As part of biospecimen and clinical data collation efforts, we have consented and obtained blood, urine or clinically indicated kidney biopsy samples from over 700 patients at the time of admission.  Using these samples, we propose (1) to use a multipronged approach to determine the biomarkers that are associated with MAKE; (2) to develop a machine learning-based predictive algorithm using a combination of multiplexed biomarker expression levels and clinical metrics; and, (3) to determine cellular pathways that are responsible for COVID-associated AKI by combining multiomics interrogation of SARS-CoV-2 positive patient urine and kidney biopsies as well as the time-dependent transcriptomic signatures of in vitro primary proximal tubule cells.  First, our results will have an immediate translational outcome, which will help focus clinical efforts on high risk patients and triage low risk patients quicker. In addition, our proposal will lead to improved understanding of the complex disease mechanisms that cause the unique kidney injury signatures in COVID-19 and may lead to development of novel biomarkers and therapeutics that may prove beneficial during post-COVID clinical care. Our rigorous approach is innovative, and it is supported by established complementary assays. We have assembled an experienced multidisciplinary team encompassing bioengineers, nephrologists, basic scientists, informaticians and virologists that will help improve the understanding of the landscape of kidney outcomes during COVID-19 hospitalizations. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Kidney podocytes play an important role in kidney filtration. In order to perform this key biological function, the podocyte has to maintain a specialized structure that depends on a number of proteins. We identified a previously unknown protein, called nebulette, as a key component of the podocyte filtration machinery, and we propose to test its role in maintenance of the specialized structure of podocytes during health and disease. Our results will improve our understanding of podocyte biology and may identify new drug targets to treat kidney diseases such as diabetic nephropathy.",Prediction of Major Adverse Kidney Events and Recovery (Pred-MAKER) in COVID-19 Patients,10216732,R01DK118222,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coca', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consent', 'Consultations', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Intervention', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Health system', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'In Situ', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nephrology', 'New York', 'New York City', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Proteinuria', 'Proteomics', 'Recovery', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Triage', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Vaccines', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'kidney biopsy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'podocyte', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'proteomic signature', 'renal damage', 'response', 'sample collection', 'spatiotemporal', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'urinary', 'virology']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,468762,0.03000044731776851
"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9926311,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,348620,-0.00312934034702087
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,10019696,R33MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Axon', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'injury recovery', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'machine learning algorithm', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'vascular injury']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R33,2020,411386,-0.0028249697282688993
"Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    The purpose of this K01 proposal is to develop innovative Big Data methodologies to improve cancer outcomes. I am a board-certified hematologist-oncologist completing a PhD in biomedical informatics at Stanford University. This proposal builds on my background and research in developing integrative analysis methods for multi-scale data. It also leverages the exceptional environment at Stanford for advanced training in machine learning, distributed computing, and longitudinal study analysis. Under the mentorship of my team of experts I will enhance my methodologies for improving knowledge discovery in cancer. Cancer research abounds with multi-scale data, from imaging to multi-modal molecular data, such as genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic. Prediction models of clinical outcomes, including survival and therapeutic response, could capitalize on the richness of information that the data embody. In practice, however, the lack of effective methods for data integrative analysis leaves much of the latent knowledge untapped. For example, imaging data are routinely obtained for diagnostic purposes, but often underutilized in integrative analysis of cancer outcomes. By establishing inter-data correlations, imaging data have the potential to become noninvasive proxies for biopsy-acquired molecular data. Furthermore, traditional methods of data analysis have limited ability to extract knowledge from multi-scale data, which are large, heterogeneous, and exhibit complex inter-data interactions. This project outlines specific approaches to enhance knowledge extraction through integrative analyses that: (1) directly relates imaging data to molecular data, and (2) provides biomedical decision support (prediction of clinical outcomes) from multi-scale data. It applies these approaches to the analysis of brain and colorectal cancers. The training aims of the proposal are designed to further the research objectives by: (1) incorporating advanced machine learning skills to enhance information capture from each data source, (2) boosting computational efficiency and overall performance of the developed methodologies to ensure scalability, and (3) adapting methodologies to a longitudinal clinical study. The proposed project has the capacity to make a significant clinical impact by establishing the role of imaging data as a surrogate for molecular data, delineating potential therapeutic targets, and generating predictive markers for clinical outcomes. Importantly, these methodologies have a high potential to be generalizable to other cancers. Data from this project will cumulatively form the basis for an R01 proposal aimed at examining the optimal analysis of longitudinal multi-scale data to determine the minimum set of data needed to achieve maximum knowledge. The proposed work, designed for completion within the award period, will build on my research skills, generate preliminary data, forge productive collaborative relationships, and enable me to compete for R01 funding. In summary, this K01 will accelerate my career development and support launching my career as an independent physician-scientist in cancer data science research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    If successful, this study of brain and colon cancers will produce new ways of analyzing biomedical data that researchers can apply to other cancers to discover better diagnostic and outcome prediction tools, as well as treatments. One method uses imaging data to infer molecular information, including potential therapies, without biopsy. Another analyzes many different sources of biomedical data to find markers that indicate onset, survival likelihood, and treatment response in cancer.",Multi-scale data integration frameworks to improve cancer outcomes,9841402,K01ES026832,"['Applied Research', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Correlations', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematologist', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Learning Skill', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Oncologist', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Source', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer subtypes', 'career', 'career development', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'longitudinal analysis', 'machine learning method', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiscale data', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,188952,0.01291440236613993
"Development and clinical validation of multimodal risk algorithms for predicting future internalizing psychopathology I am currently Assistant Professor and a licensed clinical psychologist in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Vermont. My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator using novel strategies in developmental neuroimaging to study mood and anxiety symptomatology from birth to maturity. Although I have been trained in the analysis of longitudinal structural MRI, I require further training in the processing and analysis of state-of-the-art multiband neuroimaging data that allows for more sensitive measures of brain connectivity. I am also lacking expertise with regard to more sophisticated analytic methods for more fully leveraging large-sample multimodal datasets. Such approaches will enable me to move beyond conventional univariate statistical analyses and prepare me for future Big Data initiatives. During the proposed K08 period, my overarching goal is to develop expertise in the application of machine-learning approaches to multimodal data in order to characterize the most salient psychosocial and brain-based predictors of youth internalizing psychopathology. To achieve these goals, I am pursuing career development and training activities in the following areas: 1) assessment and characterization of psychosocial risk factors; 2) theory and implementation of Big Data methods, including machine learning algorithms and cross-validation strategies; 3) analysis of multiband multimodal brain imaging data using Human Connectome Project pipelines with the aim of more comprehensively assessing aspects of cortico-limbic connectivity; 4) independently running my own neuroimaging research study; and 5) developing and submitting a competitive R01 application. In order to obtain this expertise, I am proposing training activities at several institutions, including the University of Vermont, Harvard Medical School, McGill University, and Oregon Health and Science University. The research project in this K08 proposal aims to produce risk algorithms for a transdiagnostic dimension of psychopathology, using novel machine learning approaches to leverage two of the largest longitudinal neuroimaging samples in the world (IMAGEN and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study). These risk algorithms will subsequently undergo refinement using a new sample of clinic-referred youths that I will recruit from an outpatient psychiatric clinic in Vermont. As part of the project, I will also test the degree to which these algorithms predict treatment response. These data will be used as pilot data for my planned R01 application. Given the methods that I am proposing, this project will be able to detect complex non-linear interactions involving risk factors from a multitude of domains. As a result, this work will inform, and help to delineate, various etiological pathways that ultimately result in internalizing problems. Most importantly, this project could inform early identification and targeted intervention strategies during a critical period for the development of internalizing symptomatology. !

"BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19 Abstract With South Carolina’s population already being vulnerable to poor health as evidenced by poor national health rankings, challenging rural geography and health professional shortages, the impact of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) will be long lasting in the state. Patient morbidity and mortality rates already continue to increase, with ongoing economic damage to health systems and businesses. The speed of transmission and geographical spread of COVID-19 across South Carolina and the United States is alarming, which combined with the novel nature of the disease justifies the need for accelerated research to combat this pandemic. As clinicians and frontline health workers battle to save lives, creating a data environment that accelerates research is key, and necessary to battle the disease. Access to such information will equip frontline health workers to continue the fight against the disease. This proposal will build the capacity for accelerated research and intelligence gathering by coalescing multiple state partners and leveraging relevant data for discoveries around COVID-19. To accomplish this, this proposal aims to (1) create a de-identified linked database system via REDCap and a mobile application (app) to collate surveillance, clinical, multi-omics and geospatial data on both COVID-19 patients and health workers treating COVID-19 patients in South Carolina; (2) examine the natural history of COVID-19 including transmission dynamics, disease progression, and geospatial visualization; and (3) identify important predictors of short- and long-term clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients in South Carolina using machine learning algorithms. These aims will be accomplished through collaborations with multiple state agencies and stakeholders relevant to COVID-19 and the creation of a REDCap database and mobile app that allow for coalescing relevant data in a timely fashion, combined with leveraging of statewide integrated data warehouse capabilities. Project Narrative COVID-19 represents an opportunity to create and deploy a research system that allows accelerated research on any pandemic. While South Carolina is rural in nature, and has low health rankings, it has a powerful integrated health data infrastructure that allows for tracking short-and long-term clinical and health system impacts of pandemics like the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The creation of multiple data sources at the individual level, coupled with innovative big data science techniques will advance important discoveries in disease surveillance, transmission, natural history and progression important for treatment and necessary for targeted intervention purposes in South Carolina.","BDD CIS: Big Data Driven Clinical Informatics & Surveillance - A Multimodal Database Focused Clinical, Community, & Multi-Omics Surveillance Plan for COVID19",10136980,R01AI127203,"['2019-nCoV', 'Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Archives', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Common Cold', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confidentiality of Patient Information', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Sources', 'Database Management Systems', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Partners', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rural', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Secure', 'Series', 'Source', 'South Carolina', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Virus', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'big-data science', 'combat', 'data infrastructure', 'data management', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'disability', 'disease natural history', 'disease transmission', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene therapy', 'health data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple data sources', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'novel virus', 'pandemic disease', 'patient privacy', 'precision medicine', 'response', 'systems research', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'virology']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2020,626275,0.009296356648098547
"Paneth cell phenotype as a predictive biomarker for ulcerative colitis ABSTRACT One of the challenges for the management of ulcerative colitis (UC; a subtype of inflammatory bowel disease) is the lacking of a predictive biomarker that can help stratify patients for personalized treatment strategies. We have previously shown that in Crohn’s disease (CD; another subtype of inflammatory bowel disease), the morphologic phenotype of small intestinal Paneth cells readily predicts outcome in post-surgical CD patients. Given the shared genetic etiology and clinical features between CD and UC, we hypothesize that Paneth cell phenotype will also predict outcome in UC. Our long-term goal is to define the clinical indications of inflammatory bowel disease of which Paneth cell phenotype can predict outcome. The objective of this grant is to determine to the extent of which Paneth cell phenotype predicts development of ileal complications in UC. The central hypothesis is that in UC patients undergoing total colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA), the Paneth cell phenotype obtained at time of colectomy will predict development of pouchitis and de novo CD in the ileal pouch. Our rationale is that Paneth cell phenotype will offer better outcome prediction over current practice. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: (Aim1) Paneth cell phenotype correlates with ileal complications in UC patients with IPAA; (Aim 2) Deep learning will reduce observer variation and enhance rigor and reproducibility of Paneth cell phenotype analysis in surgical pathology specimens, and also identify novel clinical factors that correlate with Paneth cell function; (Aim 3) Serum markers that correlate with Paneth cell phenotype could be used to predict outcome in UC. Upon conclusion, we will understand the role for Paneth cell function in modulating disease course in IBD. This contribution is significant since it will establish Paneth cell phenotype as a critical predictive biomarker for IBD. The proposed research is innovative because we use state-of-the-art deep learning approach to build an imaging analysis pipeline, and to identify novel clinical factors that affect Paneth cell functions. Identifying how epithelial cells with innate immune function affect disease course will provide insight into other inflammatory disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to the public health because ulcerative colitis, which is increasing in prevalence worldwide, represents a major national cost measured by both patient suffering and economic burden. Despite significant advances in care, clinical trial data demonstrate remission rates is at best of 40%. Strategies that stratify patients based on Paneth cell function represent a novel approach for outcome prediction. Upon conclusion, we will establish that Paneth cell phenotype is a predictive cellular biomarker for ileal complications in ulcerative colitis patients undergoing total colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis. We will also define the underlying genetic associations and molecular pathways of abnormal Paneth cell phenotype in these patients. In addition, we will develop deep learning algorithms that will streamline the interpretation of Paneth cell phenotype for pathology specimens, and define serum markers that correlate with Paneth cell phenotype to allow for less invasive and more frequent monitoring.",Paneth cell phenotype as a predictive biomarker for ulcerative colitis,10119843,R01DK124274,"['Affect', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cell physiology', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colectomy', 'Complex', 'Cost Measures', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease remission', 'Economic Burden', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Excision', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Homeostasis', 'Ileal Reservoirs', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Manuals', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Natural History', 'Natural Immunity', 'Observer Variation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paneth Cells', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Pouchitis', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Small Intestines', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'dysbiosis', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'gastrointestinal', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'innate immune function', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intestinal epithelium', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'prognostic', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,386463,-0.007820260959357344
"Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival  Chronic kidney disease affects about 10% of adults in the United States and 7-12% of the population worldwide. It may lead to irreversible loss of kidney function, known as end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For patients with ESRD, kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment compared to dialysis in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. Despite the advantages of kidney transplants, most patients with ESRD are treated with dialysis primarily because there exist an insufficient number of compatible donors for patients. The human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the organ donor and recipient are known to be a significant contributing factor to transplanted organ survival times due to immunogenicity, the immune response of the recipient to the transplanted organ. Mismatches between donor and recipient HLAs are associated with shorter survival times; however, it is extremely rare to identify donors that have a perfect match with recipients, so most transplants involve mismatched HLAs. Our main objective is to accurately predict survival times for kidney transplants by incorporating both data- driven models of HLA compatibility based on outcomes of past transplants and biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity. Accurate prediction of survival times can improve patient transplant outcomes by enabling more efficient allocation of donors and recipients, particularly by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a poorly matched donor. We propose to estimate HLA compatibilities using high-dimensional variable selection techniques applied to outcomes of past transplants and through a novel donor-recipient latent space model for the HLA compatibility network. We then propose to incorporate these predicted compatibilities along with biologically-driven models of HLA immunogenicity using amino acid sequences and epitopes into a multi-task classification-based survival prediction algorithm. Our proposed approach for learning integrated data- and biologically-driven models of transplant survival generalizes broadly to organ transplantation (liver, heart, pancreas, lungs) and possibly to bone marrow transplantation. Finding better methods for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching between donor and recipient may redefine and improve clinical outcomes for organ and tissue transplants. In fact, new approach may revolutionize the selection of donors with recipients, thereby producing significantly improved long-term organ and tissue transplant survivals.",Machine Learning and Network Science for Predicting Kidney Transplant Survival ,9985180,R01LM013311,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens', 'Anus', 'Biological', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Donor Selection', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epitopes', 'HLA Antigens', 'Heart', 'Immune response', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Organ Donor', 'Organ Survival', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Quality of life', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Science', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'base', 'cost', 'discrete time', 'graft failure', 'hazard', 'high dimensionality', 'human model', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'learning network', 'multitask', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'survival prediction', 'transplant model', 'treatment comparison']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO,R01,2020,277764,0.0069197462948767385
"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice.

"Statistical Methods for Ultrahigh-dimensional Biomedical Data This proposal develops novel statistics and machine learning methods for distributed analysis of big data in biomedical studies and precision medicine and for selecting a small group of molecules that are associated with biological and clinical outcomes from high-throughput data such as microarray, proteomic, and next generation sequence from biomedical research, especially for autism studies and Alzheimer’s disease research. It focuses on developing efficient distributed statistical methods for Big Data computing, storage, and communication, and for solving distributed health data collected at different locations that are hard to aggregate in meta-analysis due to privacy and ownership concerns. It develops both computationally and statistically efficient methods and valid statistical tools for exploring heterogeneity of big data in precision medicine, for studying associations of genomics and genetic information with clinical and biological outcomes, and for feature selection and model building in presence of errors-in- variables, endogeneity, and heavy-tail error distributions, and for predicting clinical outcomes and understanding molecular mechanisms. It introduces more robust and powerful statistical tests for selection of significant genes, SNPs, and proteins in presence of dependence of data, valid control of false discovery rate for dependent test statistics, and evaluation of treatment effects on a group of molecules. The strength and weakness of each proposed method will be critically analyzed via theoretical investigations and simulation studies. Related software will be developed for free dissemination. Data sets from ongoing autism research, Alzheimer’s disease, and other biomedical studies will be analyzed by using the newly developed methods and the results will be further biologically confirmed and investigated. The research findings will have strong impact on statistical analysis of high throughput big data for biomedical research and on understanding heterogeneity for precision medicine and molecular mechanisms of autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases.

"Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT  This revised NIH Individual Fellowship Award (F30) proposal seeks to develop career-specific skills and knowledge of the behavioral contributions and underlying neural mechanisms associated with co-occurring drug use disorder (DUD) and other psychiatric illnesses. The diagnosis of DUD comorbidity is well established clinically, and is prone to more difficult and expensive treatment plans and worse treatment outcomes than either diagnosis alone. Despite the prevalence and clinical significance of DUD comorbidity, few studies have characterized the interactions between environment, behavior, and neural organizations that contribute to DUD comorbidity illness trajectories. Cognitions related to self-beliefs and self-directed behaviors are compromised in individuals with DUD, depression, or PTSD, yet the altered neural circuitry underlying such deficits in comorbid individuals has not been studied. The overall research goal of the proposed project is therefore to identify traits associated with functional neural networks underlying DUD comorbidity and determine how changes in network organization lead to deficits in self-related cognitions in comorbid individuals. Additionally, machine-learning computational models will be trained on Big Data to classify brain-wide patterns of network organization at two distinct stages of DUD comorbidity development. The proposal includes a rigorous training plan for the candidate to gain expertise in neuroimaging methodology and advanced computational approaches to neuroimaging data (e.g., structural equation modeling, machine learning, and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA)). An increasingly large data sample (n=550+) of adults and adolescents 12-60 years old will be used to test the aims of this proposal. In Aim 1, controlling for age and sex, environmental variables and self-beliefs will be related to the expression of DUD comorbidity. Using whole-brain mediation analyses, significant traits will then be related to areas of brain activation, with focus on the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Aim 2 will use structural equation modeling to test how sex-specific changes in ACC networks are related to self-regulation in individuals with DUD and DUD comorbidity compared to healthy individuals. Aim 3 will use MVPA-derived computational models to classify whole-brain patterns of activity that characterize susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence and sustained comorbidity in adulthood. By classifying brain activity underlying DUD comorbidity at two separate stages of disorder development, this project will help pave the way for future research into more effective treatment methods and better preventative efforts to preclude DUD comorbidity. The career development milestones related to computational psychiatry – clinical medicine, responsible conduct of research, and computational neuroscience – will be attained via this mentored research proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development project seeks to use a Big Data approach to characterize the expression of drug use disorder (DUD) comorbidity. The multilayer project will develop skills and knowledge to support a better understanding of the behaviors and underlying neural mechanisms associated with self-related cognitions in DUD comorbidity. An innovative machine-learning pattern classifier will then be used to identify whole-brain resting-state activation patterns associated with susceptibility to DUD comorbidity during adolescence, and sustained comorbidity in adulthood.",Multi-Level Modeling of Addiction Comorbidity,9882986,F30DA043928,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Bilateral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Equation', 'Exclusion', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Linear Models', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Predisposition', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Perception', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavioral deficiency', 'career', 'career development', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'computational neuroscience', 'data modeling', 'data warehouse', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multilevel analysis', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neural patterning', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'responsible research conduct', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'working group']",NIDA,UNIV OF ARKANSAS FOR MED SCIS,F30,2020,16736,0.0039401292950753475
"Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality Over the past 15 years, new imaging technologies and methods for high throughput imaging have revolutionized structural biology by extending the resolution and scale of collected images in 3 dimensions. The resulting image volumes are more typically hundreds of GB to even tens of TB and in some cases approach PB sizes. These file sizes pose challenges for image acquisition, image analysis, and communication of a representative set of raw data and quantification. Image acquisition runs can be lengthy and expensive, and often errors are not identified until after the completion of scanning. Large files contain many structures, and require machine learning (ML) strategies in a context that permits error correction. Scientific communication requires tools for ready access to raw data, and more efficient methods to communicate the rapidly accumulating sets of scientific information. We propose to leverage virtual reality (VR) and verbal communication within the VR environment, to streamline each of these stages of scientific work, by capitalizing on the more natural abilities for stereoscopic vision and hearing to process scenes and language. Based upon the tool base and direct volume rendering of large files that we have established in our VR software, called syGlass, we will first integrate VR into the microscope controls for tuning the microscope and then efficiently inspecting images in 3D as they are acquired (Aim 1). Next, we will introduce novel domain adaptation techniques in the ML field to scale up 3D image quantification capabilities for current acquisition sizes, by coupling them with user-optimized experiences that do not require ML expertise, and yet provide automated and accurate results (Aim 2). Finally, we will provide tools to efficiently generate narrated scientific presentations in VR for use in the lab setting, as manuscript publications, and for production of educational materials (Aim 3). In each of these activities, we will introduce paradigm shifts in the management of experiments, analysis of the resulting data, and publication of manuscripts and materials to other scientists and the general public. The goal of this project is to speed the pipeline from image acquisition to communication of analyzed data for large image files (big data). We propose to leverage virtual reality to change the way users interact with their microscope, provide new methods for more accurate quantification and make scientific data more transparent, and more accessible to specialists and the general public. These new paradigms are applicable to basic, pre-clinical and clinical research, and serve the goals of big data projects to generate more reliable and encompassing scientific conclusions.","Streamlining Volumetric Imaging, Analysis and Publication Using Immersive Virtual Reality",10011054,R44MH125238,"['3-Dimensional', '3D virtual reality', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Depth Perception', 'Educational Materials', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Information Distribution', 'Ingestion', 'Instruction', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Language', 'Lasers', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Manuscripts', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Resort', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visual', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'adaptation algorithm', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'field study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'movie', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical research', 'scale up', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'tool', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment']",NIMH,ISTOVISR,R44,2020,1159612,0.0029025285693347457
"Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurological disorders and affects over 2.5 million people each year, yet no treatment has successfully translated from bench to clinic. TBI is a broad term and encompasses an extremely heterogeneous set of injuries differing by cause, severity, biomechanics, and the varied, complex secondary injury responses that collectively result in chronic disabilities. Current preclinical research circumvents the issue of TBI heterogeneity by relying on specific preclinical animal models that mimic subpopulations of patients and particular secondary injury mechanisms with each study focusing on limited, individual pathways. This proposal instead aims to tackle TBI heterogeneity by approaching TBI as a “big data” problem and aggregating and analyzing the multidimensional data collectively. A framework for data harmonization and curation will be developed, and datasets from a consortium of preclinical labs employing a variety of preclinical TBI models will be collected and curated into an open data commons (ODC-TBI). Utilizing machine learning and multidimensional analytics, the proposed research will directly leverage TBI heterogeneity in the merged dataset to identify persistent features of TBI to empower translational research. By creating a preclinical TBI ODC and applying machine learning to integrate the heterogeneity of preclinical TBI models, the project will reveal multidimensional features of TBI across heterogeneous injuries and characterize how diverse secondary injury mechanisms interact and ultimately affect injury outcome. Throughout the project's timeline, new datasets will continue to be harmonized into the ODC-TBI according to the established framework. The ODC-TBI will be the first open multicenter, multi-model repository of preclinical TBI data and will enable the application of data science to the field of TBI. Furthermore, the ODC-TBI and the methods implemented throughout the project will be openly shared to improve reproducibility of TBI research. Together with the multidimensional analysis that will provide quantitative and qualitative understanding of TBI heterogeneity, the project aims to ultimately accelerate data- driven discovery and precision medicine for TBI. Reflecting the complexities of clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI), preclinical TBI research is confounded by the extreme heterogeneity prevalent across possible injury models and resulting biological responses. The proposed research will aggregate and curate an extensive open data commons (ODC) of preclinical TBI research with multiple TBI models and utilize machine learning to tackle TBI heterogeneity directly. The project will create an ODC for preclinical TBI research to improve data sharing and scientific reproducibility, and will empower translational TBI research by identifying multidimensional features of TBI that best predict functional outcome.",Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility,10042756,F32NS117728,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Closed head injuries', 'Common Data Element', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'behavioral outcome', 'bench to bedside', 'biomarker discovery', 'controlled cortical impact', 'data curation', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple datasets', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'open data', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'response to injury']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,69810,0.022740388553164376
"Evaluating associations between trauma-related characteristics and functional recovery in individuals with spinal cord injury Project Summary World Health Organization established that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI). While existing research suggests links between the injury event, early care, and rehabilitation outcomes, there still remains a critical knowledge gap – about how characteristics associated with trauma and acute phases of SCI can allow us to better understand functional recovery post- SCI. In the past, this research was partly hampered due to databases that either focused on trauma-care or inpatient rehabilitation. However, using advanced analytical methods, we are now in a position to combine databases that contain trauma and acute phase-related variables with patient-level characteristics to assess longitudinal functional recovery over time. Trauma and acute phase-related variables include type of trauma, cause of injury, process of care, clinical data, and outcome data during acute care. The overall objective of this study is to use trauma and acute phase-related variables to explain the longitudinal functional recovery of individuals with SCI, from acute to post-acute to community. This will be achieved by probabilistically linking the Pennsylvania Trauma Systems Outcomes Study (PTOS) database with the National Spinal Cord Injury Model Systems (SCIMS) database. The PTOS and SCIMS databases provide complimentary information about trauma and acute phases of SCI from acute hospital to inpatient rehabilitation facility (IRF) to community. The long-term goal of our research is to identify trauma and acute phase-related variables that can be utilized during acute care and post-acute rehabilitation interventions to improve clinical decision making, which in turn enhances rehabilitation programs.The central hypothesis of this proposal is that trauma and acute phase- related variables, combined with patient-level characteristics, will significantly predict longitudinal functional recovery in individuals post-SCI. Our hypothesis is guided by prior research and our pilot work with the PTOS database. A primary objective of this proposal is to examine the association between trauma and acute phase- related variables with functional improvements during IRF in individuals with traumatic SCI using machine learning ensemble methods (Aim 1). A secondary objective of this study is to develop longitudinal trajectories of functional recovery over a period of 1-year post-SCI taking into account trauma, acute phase, and patient- level characteristics during acute, post-acute, and community living using growth curve modelling (Aim 2). The proposed study will yield novel insights about the relationship between trauma and acute phase-related variables with functional status. Project Narrative World Health Organization has reported that every year, around the world, between 250,000 and 500,000 people suffer a spinal cord injury (SCI).

"Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism. Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes. Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study (JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome – incident ESRD). Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan). Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope). Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank). This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease, employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for patients with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of prevalent ESRD cases in the United States, therefore new interventions to prevent or decelerate development of kidney failure are critical in order to improve the health of patients with diabetes who comprise a large sector of the US population. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the etiology of diabetic kidney complications evaluating specific components of systemic (KRIS) and local, kidney inflammation (Complement).

"TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS PROJECT SUMMARY With an associated mortality of 35%, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) contributes to the morbidity and mortality seen in many acute conditions such as pneumonia, influenza, sepsis, trauma and aspiration. Yet studies consistently show that ARDS is under-recognized in up to 40% of patients with generally low and variable adoption of practices shown to improve mortality in ARDS. The overall goal of this proposed project is to improve care delivered to ARDS patients by promoting accurate identification of patients with ARDS and increasing adoption of evidence-based interventions shown to improve outcomes in ARDS. With the recent publication of a multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS, this proposal specifically aims: 1) To increase identification of ARDS patients with an automated electronic tool (ARDS Sniffer 2.0) powered by the predictive analytics of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. 2) To translate the recently published multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS into an evidence-based, context-appropriate, Electronic Clinical decision support system in ARDS (ECARDS) for the management of ARDS. This process will be informed by an expert panel from the CPG committee as well as a semi-qualitative analysis of the cognitive decision making process, data needs and workflow of users in a series of Think-Aloud studies and focus group interviews. ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ECARDS and an ARDS Dashboard to show near real-time data on the incidence of ARDS and rate of utilization of best care will then be incorporated within the hospital EMR for useability testing with another series of Think-Aloud and semi-qualitative studies. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ARDS Dashboard, and ECARDS in a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized control trial of 3 hospitals within the Montefiore Healthcare System to increase utilization of recommended interventions in ARDS and improve outcomes. 4) To promote the dissemination of the clinical decision support system through our partner professional organizations of American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and American Association of Respiratory Care and Program for Emergency Preparedness. Because of the high pressure, high acuity, and rapidly changing status of the acutely ill ARDS patient, clinical decision making often defaults to the automated, pattern-driven cognitive processes which are particularly prone to unconscious biases and errors and cognitive overload from large volumes of shifting data. As such, this proposal is the ideal research demonstration project to develop a new clinical decision support tool that will harness the power of big data and predictive analytics to identify ARDS in the hospital and deliver an evidenced-based, expert and user informed clinical decision support tool to clinicians at the right point during their clinical interaction and workflow with these patients in order to promote the right interventions to the right patients at the right time. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome constitutes the most severe form of respiratory failure in the hospital with an associated mortality of 35%, it is consistently under-recognized and proven treatments are underutilized. This proposal aims to harness the power of big data in the hospital information system to identify patients with ARDS and prompt clinicians with the evidence-based best management of this condition. By developing a computerized decision support system whose design is informed by the experts and the clinicians themselves, this proposal aims to bring the right care to the right patient at the right time to save lives and promote recovery from this devastating condition.",TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS,9965913,R18HS026188,[' '],AHRQ,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R18,2020,397809,0.030889403939112485
"Characterizing Trauma Outcomes: From Pre-trauma Risk to Post-trauma Sequelae Abstract Background: Trauma is common, but we have little ability to predict who will develop post-trauma psychopathology. Consistent challenges to our understanding of the etiology of post-trauma psychopathology include: (1) obtaining unbiased prospective data on risk factors preceding or concurrent with trauma; (2) the inability to model large comprehensive risk structures with traditional null hypothesis testing methods, despite the knowledge that risk factors do not operate in isolation; and (3) the almost universal focus on PTSD outcomes to date, while post-trauma psychopathology likely involves various symptoms spanning multiple disorder categories. The aims of this study are to (1) use data from a large, prospective population trauma cohort to establish multidimensional classes of post-trauma psychopathology which include diagnoses from various theoretically derived categories (e.g., stress diagnoses, mood disorders, personality disorders) and (2) to discover multivariate predictor sets and novel interactions which predict post- trauma psychopathology class membership and class transitions over time. Given the projected sample size we will also be able to examine gender differences in psychopathology and resilience, as well as differences by trauma type. Study Design: This study will make use of national prospective data previously assembled as part of an R21 project (and augmented with additional trauma data and more years of follow-up) to establish a trauma cohort from 1995 – 2015. Trauma cohort members will have experienced at least one of 10 traumatic events (i.e., fires/explosions, accidents and assaults, poisoning, life-threatening illness/injury, pregnancy-related trauma and sudden family deaths). Extensive pre- trauma and post-trauma data on psychiatric diagnoses, treatment (medication and psychotherapy) and social variables will be included. We will use latent class analyses to characterize multidimensional post-trauma psychopathology outcomes (including the absence of psychopathology) and latent transition analyses to examine changes in class membership over time. Machine learning statistical methods will be applied to the expansive risk factor data to develop multivariate predictor sets for outcome classes and class transitions over time. Bias analyses will be used to assess the impact of various forms of systematic error on our results. Implications: This study fulfills NIMH’s strategic priorities of (1) charting mental illness trajectories to determine when, where, and how to intervene and (2) strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research. Our approach will achieve robust and valid risk profiles of post-trauma psychopathology in the most efficient way possible by using pre- existing prospective data from a full and unselected population. A life course multidimensional approach to trauma research is a critical next step in this field. In future work, psychopathology classes and multivariate predictor sets discovered as part of this study can be replicated and expanded in other populations to examine variations of our findings, and used as the basis for a more detailed exploration of newly discovered pathways to psychopathology risk and resilience following trauma. Narrative This large general population-based trauma cohort study will elucidate risk profiles for multidimensional psychopathology and resilience following trauma. Use of registry-based data from an unselected population and rigorous epidemiologic methods allows us to efficiently examine predictor combinations (e.g., psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, social variables), while minimizing bias.

"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization.

"A Real-Time Computational System for Detecting ARDS Using Ventilator Waveform Data Project Summary:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure affecting 10% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the United States. In-hospital mortality of 35-46% has been reported across the spectrum of mild-severe ARDS, and one third of patients with initially mild ARDS will progress to moderate or severe ARDS. Over the last 20 years, multiple studies have reported improved outcomes for ARDS patients using specific ARDS targeted therapies. However, ARDS remains persistently under-recognized and challenging to diagnose. Only one third of ICU providers correctly identify ARDS on the first day when diagnostic criteria are met, and less than two thirds ever recognize the diagnosis in the ICU. This under recognition of ARDS may prevent some patients from receiving lifesaving therapies necessary for treating the disease. Attempts to automate ARDS diagnosis using rule- based algorithms have seen limited success, and require analysis of subjective data from patient histories, like chest scans, which limit diagnosis automation, timeliness, and study reproducibility.  To improve the current state of the art of ARDS detection technology, we intend to utilize objective and readily available data including both ventilator waveform data, (VWD) and electronic health record (EMR) data to 1) improve the recognition of ARDS, and 2) identify high-risk ARDS patients most likely to benefit from additional ARDS treatments. For this task, we will make use of an existing dataset of VWD from over 500 patients receiving mechanical ventilation, including 156 patients with confirmed ARDS. Our preliminary analyses using a machine learned model and a subset of lung physiology features derived solely from VWD, suggest that ARDS can be diagnosed in the absence of a chest scan or medical history. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will improve our existing model used for discriminating ARDS by adding objective EMR data, and additional features extracted from VWD, such as patient respiratory compliance and airway resistance. Our next focus will be to predict worsening of ARDS severity in intubated patients based on Berlin criteria. So in Aim 2, we will evaluate the best tools for predicting increases in ARDS severity, and which types of temporal information yield the best predictive results.  We hypothesize that model development using additional objective data derived from VWD analysis and the EMR, along with advanced analytic techniques, will further improve ARDS diagnosis, and enable the prediction of clinical trajectories in patients with ARDS. The proposed work will yield innovative clinical decision support models that can be used to improve the state of the art in automated ARDS diagnosis. Our predictive modeling will also enable greater insight into the times when physicians can perform clinical interventions to arrest ARDS induced physiologic deterioration. Ultimately, these innovations could save lives by quickly detecting ARDS, and alerting physicians to begin or intensify ARDS focused therapies based on patient pathophysiologic state.

"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,10187768,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'effective therapy', 'hospital readmission', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'intervention cost', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,656378,-0.001876433843743926
"Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and long-term disability, and there are more than 5.3 million persons in the US alone with chronic executive attention and cognitive dysfunction. There is a funda- mental gap in knowledge of the functional and structural mechanisms underlying executive attention impair- ments after TBI. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery or, ultimately, create individualized therapies. The long-term goal of this integrated research effort is to identify the mechanism(s) underlying cognitive deficits in TBI patients, as this will enable accurate classifica- tion of their impairments, more accurate prognoses and precise evaluation of the effectiveness of interventions. The overall objective of this proposal is to relate clinically applicable EEG metrics of executive attention to quantitative metrics of structural connectivity alterations within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit (medial frontal cortex, striatum and central thalamus) and to evaluate their role in predicting cognitive outcomes after TBI. The central hypothesis is that individually measured electrophysiologic responses and anatomical injuries within the anterior forebrain mesocircuit of TBI subjects will correlate with executive attention deficits, as measured by the ANT, and accurately predict broad cognitive outcomes. This hypothesis is based on preliminary work from two studies of EEG and diffusion MRI in TBI patients, as well as related published research supporting the underly- ing model in more severely brain-injured subjects. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that char- acterizing the relationship between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and executive attention deficits at an indi- vidual level, using both physiological and anatomical measurements, will allow insight into the biological un- derpinnings of the deficits and help frame mechanistic approaches to future diagnosis and therapy. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. The first Aim is to determine the extent to which executive attentional impairment, measured with the ANT, relates to injury-related changes in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit a) physiology (EEG) and b) white matter connectivity (diffusion MRI). Part c) of Aim 1 will integrate the two modalities and relate them back to clinically-applicable EEG. {Aim 2 is to a) cross-sectionally relate and b) longitudinally predict cognitive outcomes via cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to imaging metrics collected in Aim 1.} The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opin- ion, because they propose to link attentional impairments, as measured by the ANT, to measures of physiology and connectivity on an individual basis and predict cognitive outcomes {using machine learning.} The pro- posed research is significant, because knowledge of the biology underlying attention impairment will allow for its evaluation as a prognostic measure and provide targets for effective individualized interventions. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to enable development of therapies that can dramatically improve the quality of life for millions that remain unable to return to prior levels of functioning within their communities after TBI. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying attention impairments after traumatic brain injury is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Multi-modal imaging of the mechanisms underlying impaired executive attention after traumatic brain injury,9828783,R01NS102646,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Attentional deficit', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evaluation', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prosencephalon', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Role', 'Salvelinus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic Brain Injury recovery', 'Variant', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'frontal lobe', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'personalized predictions', 'prognostic', 'recruit', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'tractography', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2020,555799,-0.007461391800865657
"A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases ABSTRACT  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF- 1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.  The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA- sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury based on mechanistic terms. NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease is a global health epidemic and is associated with increased mortality, but we do not have a detailed understanding of why this disease progresses. Identifying sub-types of patients who progress by the same molecular mechanism is important to identify patients for future clinical trials. This project aims to use gene expression data from kidney biopsies to identify patients who will respond differently to medications that increase the expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha.",A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases,9948349,K08DK124449,"['Address', 'Anemia', 'Animals', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemic', 'Erythropoietin', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia Inducible Factor', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Native Americans', 'Nephrology', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pima Indian', 'Process', 'Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'experience', 'global health', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2020,168955,0.021775152560991325
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10030705,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2020,185878,0.017429779599033135
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments.

"Finding Combinatorial Drug Repositioning Therapy For Alzheimer'S Disease And Related Dementias PROJECT SUMMARY AD/ADRD are highly complex diseases characterized by distinct molecular pathways and neuropathological phenotypes. Unfortunately, the treatment remains at best modestly effective and no new drugs have been approved since 2003. Combinatorial drug therapy for AD/ADRD treatment has not been intensively studied but it is highly promising. We hypothesize that finding repositioned drug combinations through innovative exploration of big data may uncover effective AD/ADRD treatments, with implicit advantages in overcoming drug resistance and targeting multiple biomarkers. We will combine big biomedical data from complementary sources, novel and advanced informatics models, clinical domain expertise, as well as biology knowledge and validation into a coherent framework to tackle AD/ADRD with potential combinatorial drug therapies. In an exponentially larger and more challenging space of combinatorial drug therapy, opportunities are also exponentially larger when compared with traditional single-drug models but many computational challenges need to be carefully handled. We will develop multiple computational models under two philosophical umbrellas, with focuses on quantifiable screening and biological understanding. Our findings will be validated with biological experiments from cell to mouse. If successful, we will significantly advance AD/ADRD research and benefit patients with safe and effective treatment. NARRATIVE The project aims at identifying novel drug combination therapies for AD/ADRD prevention and treatment using advanced informatics methods. We propose multiple strategies focusing on quantifiable screening and biological understanding using large healthcare databases and biology/pharmacogenomics knowledgebases.

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,9925813,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,170750,-0.011029847515186661
"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients. In this application Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will partner with Cancer Genetics, Inc. to develop a multi-omics clinical decision assay that will improve long-term outcomes for patients with advanced myeloma and generate valuable insights and tools that can be broadly leveraged for other disease indications.",Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy,9981389,R01CA244899,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Bone Marrow', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Employment', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Intestines', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Xenograft Model', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'efficacy testing', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pilot trial', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'relapse patients', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2020,519735,0.0091331414080246
"Role of the Snail1-Twist-p21 axis on cell cycle arrest and renal fibrosis development Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) such as kidney fibrosis are global health challenges. In the US alone CKD cost Medicare an estimated 50 billion dollars for patients with CKD age 65 and older in 2013. Recent studies revealed that after AKI renal epithelial cells undergo a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (pEMT) and G2/M cell cycle arrest through a Snail1-Twist1-p21 axis; these cells secrete profibrotic factors and contribute to fibrosis progression. Therefore these three factors become promising potential drug targets for treating fibrosis, but further development requires addressing several outstanding open questions. The temporal sequence and causal relation between pEMT and cell cycle arrest is controversial, and the respective roles of Snail1, Twist1, and p21 on regulating pEMT and cell cycle arrest is unclear. Addressing these questions requires quantitative systems biology approaches beyond cell biology methods traditionally used in the field. In recent years my lab has made progression on deep learning based image automated analysis for live cell images, CRISPR-based gene editing, and mathematical modeling and other quantitative biology tools. These technological developments position us to tackle the above-mentioned challenging questions related to kidney fibrosis. Based on existing studies and our preliminary results, we hypothesize that there is a temporal order of the three factors, with p21 initializing G2/M arrest, which is reinforced by subsequent upregulation of Snail1; Snail1 also activates, and Twist1 further maintains the pEMT program; due to their temporally varying roles, effectiveness of targeting these factors depends on the timing of treatment. We will test the hypothesis with quantitative imaging studies using established cell lines and primary renal epithelial cells and mathematical analysis of competing models. In Aim 1, we will perform multi-color flow cytometry studies and time-lapse imaging studies on progression of cell cycle, EMT, and other cell fates of cells under stimulation. The two types of studies will provide complementary information on whether pEMT and cell cycle are tightly coupled, and will map out the temporal sequence of events of various cell fate change as well as correlation to expression levels of the three factors. In Aim 2, we will monitor the temporal profiles of these factors through fluorescence protein tagging in single cells, and use the data to evaluate an ensemble of models to identify one or a set of minimal network regulating EMT and G2/M arrest. We will then further examine the roles of individual factors through model analysis and a series of inhibition experiments. Success of the proposed research will provide mechanistic understanding of the regulatory network of cell cycle arrest and EMT in renal epithelial cells. The proposed research is our starting point for an emerging field of quantitative systems biology on kidney fibrosis. We expect that introducing quantitative approaches will greatly accelerate future development of treatment strategies on the increasing global health challenge imposed by progression of fibrosis, which currently lacks effective treatment. Kidney fibrosis is global health challenge with no effective treatment currently. Our proposed research will examine how two fibrosis contributing processes, cell cycle arrest and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, are coupled. The research will lay foundation for developing novel dynamic strategies to treat kidney fibrosis through rescuing cells from cell cycle arrest.",Role of the Snail1-Twist-p21 axis on cell cycle arrest and renal fibrosis development,9834886,R01DK119232,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Arrest', 'Cell Cycle Progression', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Color', 'Cost of Illness', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibrosis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'G2/M Arrest', 'Genes', 'Germ Cells', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Label', 'M cell', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tubular formation', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'cellular imaging', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial to mesenchymal transition', 'established cell line', 'experimental study', 'global health', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging study', 'kidney epithelial cell', 'kidney fibrosis', 'live cell imaging', 'loss of function', 'mathematical analysis', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'renal epithelium', 'success', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,341955,0.016608051453488957
"Single Cell Analysis of Kidney Transplant Antibody Mediated Rejection PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Kidney transplantation offers the greatest survival advantage to patients with end stage kidney disease and is vastly more cost effective than dialysis. Long-term survival of kidney transplants has not improved in recent decades. Antibody mediated rejection (AMR) has been identified as a major cause of transplant failure. Currently, management of patients with AMR is inconsistent among centers and frequently fails. We hypothesize that the cell types and cell states unique to AMR can be resolved by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of biopsy samples taken from patients at the time of diagnosis. This approach uses an unsupervised framework for dissecting transcriptional heterogeneity within complex tissues such as the kidney. This allows for the interrogation of cell states and subpopulations using an unbiased clustering approach that is independent of previous knowledge and can provide unprecedented resolution. To test our hypothesis we propose the following aims: In Aim 1, we will perform scRNA-seq of 40 research biopsy cores (20 AMR and 20 non-AMR). From this data we will identify genes expressed in endothelial cells and antibody secreting cells that define AMR specific phenotypes. We have demonstrated feasibility of this approach by generating single cell data from human biopsy samples as outlined in the research plan. For Aim 2, we will use immunohistochemistry to validate these AMR specific markers on a set of independent tissue samples. For Aim 3, we will use publicly available Affymetrix microarray datasets from kidney transplant biopsies with associated outcomes data to determine which cell types are associated with allograft outcome. This proposal logically builds on the principal investigator’s previous research experience and clinical training. To date he has been working full time in clinical transplantation and continuing his research endeavors on an ‘out of hours’ basis. Despite this his research output and experience continue to grow and he has recently published a report on the first successful application of this technology to human kidney biopsy tissue (co-first author). This proposal now focuses on expanding his scientific skills by attaining additional knowledge and practical research experience in single cell methods, bioinformatics and immunology. The career development goals will be achieved through a multi-faceted approach involving mentoring by Dr. Benjamin Humphreys and an advisory committee consisting of Drs. Barbara Murphy (transplant genomics), Phil Payne (biomedical informatics and translational science), Rob Mitra (single cell applications) and Paul Allen (translational immunology), didactic coursework, scientific investigation, and training in scientific communication and research ethics. This work will take place in Washington University which has a rich history of mentoring successful physician-scientists. Successful completion of this career development award will result in a better understanding of AMR, result in the principal investigator’s transition to an independent physician- scientist, and provide a solid foundation from which he will apply for RO1-level funding.

The pathophysiology of antibody mediated rejection is poorly understood and current treatment strategies frequently fail.

"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,9945838,R01HL152083,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bilateral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Electrons', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Ventilator', 'alveolar epithelium', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial injury', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'lung injury', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor for advanced glycation endproducts', 'recruit', 'secondary outcome', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,575013,-0.011120457459720153
"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,10019612,K23NS114201,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master of Science', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological Models', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'active comparator', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'stroke patient', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,200880,-0.06469316682986141
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,10004715,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'post-trauma', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2020,658730,0.0010073585939949987
"In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones OVERALL SUMMARY  The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and inefficient emergency department visits that typically include repetitive exposure to ionizing radiation from diagnostic imaging, and will significantly reduce the often lengthy (days to weeks) wait time patients must endure before procedures for stone removal can be scheduled and performed. As the proposed therapy system is entirely noninvasive, patients will be treated on an outpatient basis. Further, as the system is designed to efficiently and painlessly break stones of any size and expel the fragments from the kidney, the treatment of both symptomatic and asymptomatic stones using this technology will reduce the high retreatment and stone event recurrence rates associated with current surgical interventions for stone removal.  In this effort, we will combine stone breakage by burst wave lithotripsy (BWL), clearance of fragments by ultrasonic propulsion (UP), and stone-specific ultrasound imaging (S-mode) into an integrated system in which exposure strategies are adapted during treatment in response to real-time acoustic feedback to enhance comminution efficiency and patient safety. We will tailor treatment by investigating numerically and in lab tests the primary mechanisms - cavitation and elastic waves - involved in the comminution process over a broad parameter space. We will develop acoustics-based feedback including model- based, machine learning and passive acoustic mapping (PAM) of the bubble field to signal the need to adjust the energy output. We will investigate the morphological and functional response of the kidney in living animals and in ex vivo perfused porcine kidneys, and pursue tissue protective treatment strategies such as power ramping.  These studies will include the first in-human test of BWL in which we will compare the comminution effectiveness and safety of treatment with and without adaptive output control in response to acoustic feedback. In addition, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial of the benefits and risks of fragmenting and expelling symptomatic and asymptomatic stones in the clinic. Toward application of the system for use in humans, we will refine and validate the use of UP and S-mode together to improve stone and fragment detection. With our eye on the future of stone management, we will develop and validate in vivo an extracorporeal acoustic tractor beam to grasp and carry fragments through the complex three- dimensional path of the urinary space and out of the kidney. OVERALL NARRATIVE Urinary stone disease, which affects 1 in 11 Americans, is one of the most painful diseases and also the costliest non-malignant urologic disease, because current management is limited to observation for the stone to pass or performing surgery. The main focus of this Program Project Grant is to discover the foundational and translational knowledge needed to create an office-based, handheld ultrasound device to target, detach, break, and expel stones and stone fragments from the urinary space to facilitate natural clearance. This system will obviate costly and temporizing emergency department visits and radiation exposing imaging while the patient waits in pain for days to weeks for the stone to pass or be surgically removed.","In-Office, Ultrasound-Based Breakage and Removal of Urinary stones",10005352,P01DK043881,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biostatistics Core', 'Bowman&apos', 's space', 'Calibration', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Fracture', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lithotripsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Non-Malignant', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Painless', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Publications', 'Radiation exposure', 'Ramp', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Renal Tissue', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retreatment', 'Safety', 'Sample Size', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'calcification', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'grasp', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individualized medicine', 'next generation', 'patient safety', 'programs', 'response', 'safety study', 'simulation', 'structured data', 'success', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,P01,2020,1567293,-0.017727680826534007
"Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health Project Summary  Decades of research suggest that neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage increases children's health risk. This proposed project seeks to address two major weaknesses in conventional neighborhood effects research and interventions: a) the assumption that residential neighborhoods function independently of each other - ignoring that risk factors in areas where people work, learn, and play away from home may interact with residential factors; and b) as importantly, insufficient understanding of neighborhood effects mechanisms and heterogeneity in effects. To systematically address these critical barriers in the field, I propose a research and training program that will enable me to learn, use, and adapt recent advancements in Big Data analytics. I plan to model hidden interdependencies among individuals and neighborhoods and operationalize mechanisms of neighborhood effects by drawing on multiple large datasets (demographic, geospatial, networks, population flows), with several hundred million observations across multiple states, cities, and years, and match them to locally and nationally representative restricted survey data. The massive volume, great variety, and unique complexity of such data, such as relational data on inter-neighborhood dependencies and interactions, pose a challenge to the standard capabilities of hardware, algorithms, and analytical methods and models of social and population science. The proposed training program in Big Data analytics and machine learning will enable me to overcome computational and conceptual challenges and uniquely position me to: a) examine the ecological inter-neighborhood networks (econetworks) to which population groups are differentially exposed to across space and time; and b) test new contextual mechanisms underlying children's exposures to health risks. Specifically, I propose to: a) develop computational models of dynamic large scale econetworks to assess population differences in exposures to health risk factors, as they commute daily between home and workplaces; b) examine heterogeneity in econetwork effects on child health using a hybrid design that links Big Data to local and national surveys; and c) model child health risk mechanisms and causal effects using natural experiments on Big Data. The proposed training program will enable me to learn and adapt Big Data analytics, draw on its strengths, but also address some of its key limitations. With the support of a unique team of distinguished mentors and advisors, established experts in Big Data analytics, spatial demography, network analysis, child development and health risk, neighborhood change, and population heterogeneity, I will embark on a training program that will uniquely enable me to address these research goals and position me to become an independent scholar and a leader in the field. Project Narrative This project contributes to advancing public health scholarship by leveraging and adapting Big Data analytical tools to overcome critical barriers in the field related to conventional assumptions about effects of neighborhood risk exposures on child health. It addresses the need to understand and model inter- neighborhood interdependencies and underlying multidimensional social capital mechanisms in order to better understand population heterogeneity in neighborhood effects on child health across space and time. The project also advances public health through an integration of rigorous social and data science methodology to create new measures and test causal hypotheses that advance our understanding of social capital forces that foster resilience to adversity and improve child health behavior and outcomes.",Big Data and Network Analysis of Children's Health,10003037,K01HD093863,"['Address', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Businesses', 'Censuses', 'Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Child Rearing', 'Cities', 'Collaborations', 'Commuting', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Demography', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Distress', 'Drug usage', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health behavior outcomes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Group', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Pregnancy in Adolescence', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Smoking', 'Social Sciences', 'Social Work', 'Social support', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress and Coping', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Victimization', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'boys', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'large scale data', 'low socioeconomic status', 'neighborhood disadvantage', 'population health', 'programs', 'resilience', 'social capital', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories', 'violence exposure']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,K01,2020,137660,-0.003237075603278287
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9982966,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'big-data science', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability', 'visual tracking']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2020,202463,-0.002096742102713094
"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,9969424,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes distress', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'in silico', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,599203,0.0036344148429550043
"Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in Older Patients The objective of this proposal is to develop a predictive model to identify individuals who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and at risk of developing severe COVID-19. Louisiana has the 5th highest death rate per capita in the United States as of May 4th, 2020. Severe disease is seen in older individuals and those with underlying conditions. The New Orleans population is particularly susceptible to severe COVID-19 as hypertension, diabetes and obesity are rampant. After infection, acute lung injury caused by the virus must be repaired to regain lung function and avoid acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. Mounting evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 have cytokine storm syndrome, which may exacerbate multiorgan injury and risk of fibrotic complications. Lack of effective ways to identify and attenuate severe COVID-19 progression persist due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for cytokine storm syndrome and increased risk in older patients. Therefore, there is a need to determine the critical cytokine profiles responsible for severe COVID-19 progression to develop effective treatments. Further, it is essential to find a way to stage disease trajectory(ies) to identify therapeutic targets with precision to attenuate disease progression and uncover preventive strategies. Towards this end, we seek to leverage a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2-induced lung damage to predict severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis by considering key cytokine-cell interactions. We hypothesize that the model will accurately predict quantitative changes in suites of key cytokines and matrix accumulation with varying COVID-19 progression within 10% accuracy. To accomplish this, we have assembled an investigative team at Tulane University with key expertise in virology, clinical infectious disease research, bioinformatics, and predictive mathematical models of tissue remodeling. In Aim 1 of the proposal, we will identify the critical cytokine markers linked to viral-induced lung damage and pulmonary fibrosis. This will be accomplished by leveraging machine learning to determine the biomarkers and molecular pathways characterizing progression of severe COVID-19 to focus model formulation. In Aim 2, we will predict the severity of COVID-19 in older patients. Model predictions will be compared to blood markers of COVID-19 disease in cohorts of older patients at different stages of disease progression. The model will be refined and informed by cytokine data to discern causal biological pathways and disease processes that can be tested and targeted. Our expected outcome is to have determined the critical cytokine interactions responsible for lung tissue damage and dictating pathways for varying disease trajectories in older patients. These results are expected to have an important impact as the proposed predictive model will open new avenues of research to rationally design pharmaceutical interventions for severe COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the study will provide a paradigm-shifting open-source tool to delineate target therapeutics, estimate their efficacy, and move towards development of patient-specific treatment plans for older individuals. Severe COVID-19 is seen in older individuals and those with underlying complications such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Lack of effective ways to identify and halt severe COVID-19 progression persists due to limited understanding of the biological pathways responsible for increased risk and cytokine storm syndrome. Towards this end, in this proposal we will test our hypothesis that a mathematical model informed by key patient- specific suites of cytokines is capable of predicting patient trajectories, which will provide a strong evidence- based proof of concept for future efforts to rationally design interventions for severe COVID-19 patients.",Predictive Modeling of COVID-19 Progression in Older Patients,10162283,P20GM103629,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Lung Injury', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'Cell Communication', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Fibrosis', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Louisiana', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'extracellular', 'genetic predictors', 'individualized medicine', 'lung injury', 'mathematical model', 'molecular pathology', 'multiorgan injury', 'nonhuman primate', 'older patient', 'open source', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'repaired', 'research study', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'virology', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,P20,2020,379884,-0.05275534133476188
"Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in over 50% of patients with sepsis and is associated with increased risk of mortality and other complications, including longer hospital length of stay and the development or progression of chronic kidney disease. To date, therapies for sepsis associated AKI (SA-AKI) remain largely supportive. One possible reason for the failure of targeted therapies may be the currently limited understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition. Traditionally, SA-AKI has been thought to be largely due to renal ischemia secondary to hypoperfusion. However, animal models show that SA-AKI is actually a state characterized by hyperdynamic circulation, and review of histological changes in septic patients shows a lack of acute tubular necrosis, a pathological finding often associated with renal ischemia. Rather, it appears that a combination of immunologic, toxic and inflammatory factors likely leads to SA-AKI, and intervening along these pathways may improve patient outcomes for SA-AKI. We hypothesize that within a population with SA-AKI, there are subgroups who have particular inflammatory and immunological profiles that are associated with differential outcomes and response to therapies. In the fields of asthma and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, the use of clinical data and biomarkers to identify such subpopulations, or sub-phenotypes, of disease, has led to new treatment paradigms, where individuals with a specific biological profile receive and benefit from a targeted therapy. We propose to use data from a large, established cohort of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (the Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury [EARLI] cohort) to define sub-phenotypes of SA-AKI using latent class analysis. Latent class analysis is an established method that uses mixture models to identify sub- phenotypes within a heterogenous population in an unbiased manner. Prior work using this methodology has allowed for discovery of new disease entities that inform biological pathways of cellular injury leading to organ failure. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: To identify novel sub-phenotypes of patients with SA-AKI and discover molecular targets for therapy through the incorporation of clinical and biomarker data into our latent class analysis. Aim 2: To determine whether certain sub-phenotypes are associated with differential outcomes with regards to mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, or duration of AKI. Through the studies outlined in this F32 proposal, Dr. Kwong will learn how to rigorously conduct latent class analysis as well as other unbiased analytic techniques (e.g., machine learning) and to apply these techniques to AKI. This work will effectively position Dr. Kwong for her future research studies, where she wants to identify appropriate patients for clinical trials of AKI therapies and to better define the pathophysiology of human AKI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis has been shown to be a key contributing factor for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). To date, there are no available targeted therapies for sepsis-associated AKI besides supportive care with antibiotics and fluids. The long-term goal of this project is to find new therapeutics for sepsis-associated AKI by first identifying sub-phenotypes based on clinical and biomarker profiles that may inform the molecular pathways of injury and then determining their association with adverse outcomes.",Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury,9833437,F32DK118870,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Acute Kidney Tubular Necrosis', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Allergic', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Apoptotic', 'Aspirin', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Failure', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Fluid Balance', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Oliguria', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary to', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Urine', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cell injury', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lung injury', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'renal ischemia', 'research study', 'response', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'tubular necrosis']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,81571,0.009895833382499273
"Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by pancreatic beta destruction with subsequent insulin depletion. The alterations in glucose dynamics are incredibly difficult to manage and are confounded by meals, exercise, menstruation, and stress. Although automated insulin delivery systems are becoming commercially available, the large majority of people with T1D are treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). Dangerous complications of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis can occur from failure to dose insulin correctly, however vigilant adherence to tedious insulin dosing strategies are difficult for MDI users maintain. This difficulty is magnified during exercise, which is critical to ameliorating long-term complications of diabetes; even when guidelines for insulin dosage adjustments are followed, acute hypoglycemia during exercise and night-time hypoglycemia can occur. In our recent survey of 1400 subjects living with T1D, the majority of subjects on MDI therapy were not confident in managing their glucose during exercise and felt they lacked tools to do so. In aggregate, difficult treatment schedules and bolus calculations, associated acute complications from daily activities, and the emotional and psychological toll of this chronic disease can result in treatment non-adherence and poor glycemic outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for decision support tools designed for MDI users to improve glycemic control surrounding meals, daily activities and exercise. The goal of this proposal to develop a decision support tool for patients with type 1 diabetes who utilize continuous glucose monitoring systems and multiple daily injection therapy. This tool will be called miTREAT, the multiple injection treatment recommender system for exercise-aware therapies. We hypothesize that use of a novel decision support tool equipped with content-based collaborative filtering methods and dynamic exercise hypoglycemia prediction algorithms will improve overall euglycemia and reduce time spent in hypoglycemia for patients on MDI therapy. In our first aim, we will leverage decades of research in computer science recommender systems and machine learning optimization strategies to develop a novel decision support system that identifies issues in glycemic control and recommends appropriate insulin dose and behavioral modifications. In our second aim, we will develop a new exercise model that reflects both the dynamics of rapid-uptake of glucose through GLUT-4 channels and the longitudinal biphasic insulin sensitivity profile. This new model structure will be used to predict hypoglycemia during and after the exercise period. In our third aim, we will explore the performance of our decision support engine in an in-vivo clinical trial. This clinical trial will assess the usability of a new smart-phone app designed to assist MDI users that we have developed at OHSU. In achieving these goals, we will develop the first decision support system that provides treatment and behavioral recommendations to patients on CGM-augmented MDI therapy. This system will improve overall time in euglycemia, and reduce the occurrence of acute complications surrounding exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 Diabetes is difficult to manage through multiple daily injections, and there is a paucity of tools available to assist patients with treatment decisions. In this proposal, the fields of computer science, machine learning, constrained optimization and clinical science are united to develop a novel decision support tool for multiple daily injection users. This is accomplished in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,9898150,F31DK121436,"['Acute', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Assimilations', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical Technology', 'Menstruation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Running', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Study Subject', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'computer science', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'dosage', 'e-commerce', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'glucose disposal', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insulin sensitivity', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,50520,-0.003773519014394021
"Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney Kidney function, both under normal conditions and in the setting of injury or disease, is predominantly controlled by the amount, localization and activation state of proteins in specific cells at specific sites and under specific spatial influences that in turn regulate cell differentiation, division, metabolism, morphology, membrane polarization, secretion and transport. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) takes advantage of laser ionization and time of flight mass spectrometry to simultaneously identify >40 metal ion-conjugated antibodies from tissue sections at 1micron resolution with essentially no background signal. By mixing cell specific antibodies and activation state-specific antibodies in the same cocktail, IMC produces a spatially preserved analysis of the location and activation state of multiple cell types from the same tissue section. We have developed a panel of 21 antibodies for simultaneous kidney section hybridization and IMC analysis, and a machine-learning based analysis pipeline that has allowed us to provide the first quantitative atlas of the number and location of the tubular, endothelial, glomerular and interstitial cells in the normal human kidney (Singh et al., JCI-Insight, in press). We now propose to validate an additional 22-29 antibodies for an expansion of this panel so as to provide information on the immune activation state and resident epithelial and endothelial cell injury, survival and death pathway responses predicted to be important in the injured human kidney. We will first perform in vitro validation of antibodies that detect cell injury/dedifferentiation states, survival pathways (autophagy, unfolded protein response, proliferation), and cell death/senescence pathways (apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, senescence, Specific Aim 1), as well as immune cell populations and their activation states (Specific Aim 2). We will then perform IMC/Kidney-MAPPS based validation of the composite panel using carefully characterized human kidney biopsies from patients with defined clinical insults and morphologically quantified tubular and endothelial injury (Specific Aim 3). The end product of this proposal will be to provide a validated set of antibodies that can be used to accurately quantify cell injury states and subsequent responses across a spectrum of human kidney diseases. These antibodies can then be used by investigators who perform multiplexed imaging of the kidney, including IMC, IONpath MIBI cytometry, Tissue Cytometry and Repeated Fluorescent Imaging to mechanistically interrogate human AKI. Acute Kidney Injury is an important cause of in-hospital morbidity and mortality. While we have a great understanding of the biological events in animal models of kidney injury, we have much less understanding of the events that cause human kidney Injury. This proposal is designed to develop the resources needed to study human kidney injury and thus inform better clinical trials of treatments to both prevent kidney injury and improve recovery.",Identifying Resident and Immune Cell Injury Responses in the Human Kidney,9954680,R21AG067335,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Activation', 'Apoptosis', 'Atlases', 'Autophagocytosis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation process', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Crystallization', 'Cytometry', 'Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development', 'Differentiation Antigens', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Female', 'Formalin', 'Grant', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Interstitial Nephritis', 'Intervention', 'Ions', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Metals', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nephrectomy', 'Paraffin', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Tissues', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'analysis pipeline', 'antibody conjugate', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomedical referral center', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinical diagnostics', 'design', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'eosinophil', 'fluorescence imaging', 'human imaging', 'immune activation', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'injured', 'insight', 'interstitial cell', 'ionization', 'ischemic injury', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney cell', 'kidney imaging', 'living kidney donor', 'macrophage', 'male', 'mast cell', 'mortality', 'multiplexed imaging', 'novel therapeutics', 'phenome', 'predicting response', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'quantum', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'response to injury', 'screening', 'senescence', 'time of flight mass spectrometry', 'tumor']",NIA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,251250,0.015474778755141702
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),9912846,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,761406,-0.011774065357855978
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9983146,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'blood-brain barrier disruption', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'platelet function', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,198907,0.0005640122044605493
"Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.  The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular) responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.  Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9 subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type 2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous, spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.  We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN (SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney dysfunction, and can lead to chronic kidney disease in many patients. We know that AIN occurs as an immune response in the kidney to certain drugs or infections, but do not have a clear understanding of the cell sources of the inflammation or the tubular and vascular responses. This proposal is designed to define these immune events in human kidney biopsy samples left over after clinical diagnosis has been completed, and to determine how they relate to the development of chronic kidney disease.",Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis,10096452,R01DK126815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Delayed Hypersensitivity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Formalin', 'Health', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-9', 'Interstitial Nephritis', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Neighborhoods', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Withdrawal', 'adjudicate', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'eosinophil', 'exhaust', 'improved', 'injured', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'mast cell', 'multiphoton imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'renal damage', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'vascular injury']",NIDDK,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,564483,-0.01767142051867204
"Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB) Project Summary We request a high-flux x-ray source and to acquire new team expertise in segmentation from microCT images, in order to apply a new 3D form of histology developed through our parent R24 to begin to characterize the cellular and tissue geometries of COVID-19-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) pneumonia, our pandemic’s most common cause of death. Our novel imaging tool, X-ray histotomography, is based on microCT of fixed and metal-stained tissue. It is unique among 3D imaging methods as the only nondestructive way to achieve pan-cellular imaging (allowing characterization of all cell types and tissues) and is potentially practical. Histotomography uniquely allows direct comparison with today’s 2D standard of tissue diagnosis, histology, capable of producing both 3D renderings and undistorted 2D slices at any angle and any slice thickness. Unlike histology, we will also allow us to precisely characterize cellular arrangements into tissues after fixing and staining of samples with metal. The ability to volumetrically characterize cell types and their arrangements in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is particularly important because it is what kills most patients in coronavirus-based pandemics, including SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2003, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) in 2012, COVID-19 now. The proposed work will increase our preparedness for future pandemics. ARDS lungs are an ideal human tissue model for mathematically defining human disease because all cell types are affected. The proposed work with COVID-19 lungs will increase the precision with which we understand the different stages of coronavirus lung infection and serve as a model for characterizing the Geometry of Disease across all organ systems. Histotomography in the parent R24 is currently limited to animal models, focusing on the zebrafish. The supplement will allow us to translate our work to human health, which was originally envisioned by the PI, as part of defining the “Geometry of Disease”. Our experience with this technology tells us that we will be able to characterize the numbers of each of the basic inflammatory cell types, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages (which are morphologically distinct) in terms of numbers, volumes, shapes, and density in the inflamed tissue, and to also characterize the changes in the lung epithelia (bronchial ciliated epithelial cells and pneumocytes, cell death, and the filling of airways with fluid and fibrinous exudate, and vascular inflammation. In addition to quantitation of tissue changes, we will also be able to visualize pathological change in the tissues using virtual reality. Histotomography will serve as a way to validate a humanized mouse model of COVID-19 infection by comparing the quantitative changes with those in human autopsy samples. We will be comparing both standard histological sections and histotomographic images from adjacent tissue. Machine learning will ultimately allow us to automate recognition of cell types and pathological change. The proposed augmentation of our instrumentation and expertise will facilitate definitions of the “Geometry of Disease” across organ systems. Project narrative We request an equipment upgrade and acquisition of expertise to accelerate progress and to pilot the translational use of our ORIP-funded technology to provide the first 3D understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Histotomography, a new 3D form of histology based on microCT, is the first practical way to turn the current standard of 2D, qualitative, tissue analytics into quantitative, morphometrics that is inclusive of all cell types and tissue architecture. Organismal and tissue phenotyping at both scales makes possible the first 3D, complete phenotyping of cells and tissue architecture, promising to transform human tissue diagnostics, preclinical toxicology, and more comprehensive high-throughput genetic, chemical and disease phenomics.",Groundwork for a Synchrotron MicroCT Imaging Resource for Biology (SMIRB),10169023,R24OD018559,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Alveolar', 'American', 'Animal Model', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biology', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Volumes', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Control Animal', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Female', 'Floods', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intelligence', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung infections', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Metals', 'Microscopy', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome', 'Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Negative Staining', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pneumonia', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Readiness', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'SARS coronavirus', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Shapes', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stains', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Synchrotrons', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Translating', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'body system', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'computational basis', 'density', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'human morbidity', 'human mortality', 'human tissue', 'humanized mouse', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'instrumentation', 'macrophage', 'male', 'mathematical model', 'microCT', 'mouse model', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'parent project', 'phenomics', 'pneumocyte', 'pre-clinical', 'reconstruction', 'submicron', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'vascular inflammation', 'virtual reality']",OD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R24,2020,655483,-0.04937169884372252
"Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers Project Summary Clinicians’ ability to accurately diagnose pneumonia and choose appropriate treatment is enhanced by well- designed clinical decision support (CDS), thereby increasing patient safety. Pneumonia CDS has historically been focused on inpatient settings, but ambulatory care settings with high pneumonia patient volumes and different care processes also need CDS. We propose to adapt and evaluate an innovative, validated electronic clinical decision support (CDS) tool based on consensus guidelines for pneumonia (ePNa) to urgent care centers (UCC). The proposal supports four aims: 1) Adapt ePNa for UCC and after in silico testing, pilot it among “super user” clinicians during UCC shifts and assess its usability. ePNa needs adaptation for the limited patient data available in UCC, calibration of severity measures for lower observed mortality, and a chest imaging prompt in patients with pneumonia signs and symptoms. ePNa for UCC will incorporate the artificial intelligence CheXpert model to provide real-time (within seconds) electronic classification of chest images for elements of pneumonia diagnosis and treatment (radiographic pneumonia, single vs multiple lobes, and pleural effusion). 2) Use the CFIR framework, a focus group of UCC clinicians, and workflow observations to identify barriers and facilitators to adaptation and implementation of ePNa to UCC. 3) Test the implementation strategy by deploying ePNa at one of two randomly chosen Intermountain Healthcare UCC clusters each with about 800 annual pneumonia patients - the other a usual care control. 4) Co-primary outcomes are a) Patients diagnosed with pneumonia without chest imaging will be ≥50% lower in the ePNa cluster. b) Antibiotic prescribing for treatment of pneumonia will be ≥90% consistent with consensus guidelines and higher in the ePNa cluster. Safety measures will be unplanned subsequent 7-day ED visits/hospitalizations and 30-day mortality. Based on this rigorous pilot study, we anticipate a subsequent multi-system cluster-randomized trial including Cerner systems outside Utah. Our work incorporates the Five Rights of CDS to ensure that the strengths of this technology are optimized in the clinical environment. We will leverage experience in innovative pneumonia research, pioneering CDS, and implementation science available at Intermountain to successfully complete this proposal. The proposal will be facilitated by and disseminated through Intermountain relationships with the PCORnet Learning Health Systems Network, PCOR CDS Learning Network, the Healthcare Services Platform Consortium, Cerner, and clinicaltrials.gov. Our innovative proposal promises to advance safety for patients suspected of pneumonia in an understudied, high-volume ambulatory care setting. Project Narrative Pneumonia is the most common serious infection among adults, but diagnosis and treatment decisions vary between different clinicians. We will adapt for free standing urgent care clinics a validated, real-time, emergency department deployed, electronic pneumonia clinical decision support tool (ePNa). We hypothesize successful implementation of ePNa using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research into a cluster of urgent care clinics which treat about 800 pneumonia patients annually will improve care processes and patient outcomes compared to a similar cluster of usual care clinics.","Adaptation and pilot implementation of a validated, electronic real time clinical decision support tool for care of Pneumonia patients in 12 Utah Urgent Care Centers",9932165,R18HS026886,[' '],AHRQ,"IHC HEALTH SERVICES, INC.",R18,2020,443454,-0.011357105023094605
"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers. The proposed research will generate a model of how data science and network analysis can be used to understand the implementation of a complex evidence-based practice.",A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,9963341,R01HL140362,"['Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Attitude', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Community Hospitals', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diffusion of Innovation', 'Environment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Height', 'High Prevalence', 'Hypoxemia', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Intensive Care Units', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nurses', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Professional Organizations', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tidal Volume', 'Variant', 'base', 'community setting', 'complex data ', 'computer science', 'dissemination research', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'lung injury', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'respiratory', 'response', 'theories', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM,R01,2020,745390,0.018316096647745108
"Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data Project Summary This project develops novel statistical inference procedures for biomedical big data (BBD), including data from diverse omics platforms, various medical imaging technologies and electronic health records. Statistical inference, i.e., assess- ing uncertainty, statistical signiﬁcance and conﬁdence, is a key step in computational pipelines that aim to discover new disease mechanisms and develop effective treatments using BBD. However, the development of statistical inference procedures for BBD has lagged behind technological advances. In fact, while point estimation and variable selection procedures for BBD have matured over the past two decades, existing inference procedures are either limited to simple methods for marginal inference and/or lack the ability to integrate biomedical data across multiple studies and plat- forms. This paucity is, in large part, due to the challenges of statistical inference in high-dimensional models, where the number of features is considerably larger than the number of subjects in the study. Motivated by our team's extensive and complementary expertise in analyzing multi-omics data from heterogenous studies, including the TOPMed project on which multiple team members currently collaborate, the current proposal aims to address these challenges. The ﬁrst aim of the project develops a novel inference procedure for conditional parameters in high-dimensional models based on dimension reduction, which facilitates seamless integration of external biological information, as well as biomedical data across multiple studies and platforms. To expand the application of this method to very high-dimensional models that arise in BBD applications, the second aim develops a data-adaptive screening procedure for selecting an optimal subset of relevant variables. The third aim develops a novel inference procedure for high-dimensional mixed linear models. This method expands the application domain of high-dimensional inference procedures to studies with longitu- dinal data and repeated measures, which arise commonly in biomedical applications. The fourth aim develops a novel data-driven procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), which facilitates the integration of evidence from multiple BBD sources, while minimizing the false negative rate (FNR) for optimal discovery. Upon evaluation using ex- tensive simulation experiments and application to multi-omics data from the TOPMed project, the last aim implements the proposed methods into easy-to-use open-source software tools leveraging the R programming language and the capabilities of the Galaxy workﬂow system, thus providing an expandable platform for further developments for BBD methods and tools. Public Health Relevance Biomedical big data (BBD), including large collections of omics data, medical imaging data, and electronic health records, offer unprecedented opportunities for discovering disease mechanisms and developing effective treatments. However, despite their tremendous potential, discovery using BBD has been hindered by computational challenges, including limited advances in statistical inference procedures that allow biomedical researchers to investigate uncon- founded associations among biomarkers of interest and various biological phenotypes, while integrating data from multiple BBD sources. The current proposal bridges this gap by developing novel statistical machine learning methods and easy-to-use open-source software for statistical inference in BBD, which are designed to facilitate the integration of data from multiple studies and platforms.",Novel Statistical Inference for Biomedical Big Data,9969887,R01GM133848,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Galaxy', 'Genetic study', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'R programming language ', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'computational pipelines', 'data integration', 'design', 'diverse data', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'user friendly software']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,456980,0.001629560852627827
"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,9891542,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data warehouse', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2020,130488,0.03982054841785551
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,9925731,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2020,653985,0.014777501721100903
"Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease A growing number of older patients are living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to advances in life- prolonging technologies and the aging of the population. As CKD advances towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD), even life-prolonging technologies cannot extend life indefinitely, especially for patients who have a poor prognosis and for whom decisions about medical interventions become particularly important. Consequently, older patients with advanced CKD need to communicate with their physicians about their preferences regarding CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care (medical management of symptoms of advanced CKD without dialysis) in order to make crucial decisions impacting the length and quality of their lives. Communication surrounding medical decision making is formalized in Advance Care Planning (ACP), a process involving verbal or written information designed to inform patients of possible medical options including CPR, dialysis and supportive kidney care. Traditional ACP for patients with ESRD relies on ad hoc verbal descriptions of treatment options. This approach is limited because these options are difficult to envision. We have developed a video decision aid for reviewing CPR, dialysis and non-dialytic treatment preferences in ESRD. The tool, which is available in both English and Spanish, also allows patients to video record their preferences (""video declaration"") and share their preferences with their clinicians and caregivers. The overall objective of this study is to conduct a multi-center randomized trial of the video intervention (vs. usual care) to test the hypothesis that the video better informs older persons with advanced CKD and poor prognosis of their treatment options and leads to more ACP documentation, informed decision making, and improved quality of life. We will compare ACP documentation after one year (or at time of death) among 600 patients aged 75 or older with advanced CKD and poor prognosis randomly assigned to either the video intervention or usual care (Aim 1). We will compare ESRD treatment preferences, decisional conflict, ACP engagement and conversations, and concordance of preferences stated after the video intervention or usual care with ESRD care delivery after one year (or at time of death) (Aim 2). We will explore the quality of life, longevity, and cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) associated with patients' ESRD treatment decisions in the video vs. control groups (Aim 3). We will also conduct a qualitative assessment of the video declarations as well as barriers and facilitators for intervention success (Aims 4 and 5). ESRD in older patients involves complex decision making. It is imperative that we develop and evaluate early interventions to deliver more patient- focused care to this rapidly growing segment of the population. Using videos to enhance communication offers an opportunity to improve care of this vulnerable group of patients. Video is a practical, evidence-based, and innovative approach that has the potential to improve the quality of care provided to tens of thousands of older Americans. It is imperative to develop scalable and effective approaches to supporting persons with advanced kidney disease and their family caregivers. By providing video education tools to better inform persons making decisions about medical care and offering evidence-based options for kidney care, there is an opportunity to improve quality of life throughout the care trajectory.",Improving Medical Decision Making for Older Patients with End Stage Renal Disease,9946617,R01AG066892,"['Address', 'Advance Care Planning', 'Aging', 'American', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Control Groups', 'Counseling', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Documentation', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emotional', 'End stage renal failure', 'Family Caregiver', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patient Focused Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Supportive care', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'aged', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'design', 'efficacy study', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'literacy', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'randomized trial', 'secondary outcome', 'success', 'symptom management', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment planning', 'visual information']",NIA,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,2331112,-0.03398093161619009
"Development of a Digital Monitoring System to Reduce Risk of Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injuries Project Summary/Abstract The goal of the proposed SBIR project is to develop, implement, and demonstrate the feasibility of a Digital Pressure Injury Monitoring (DPIM) system to reduce the risk of Hospital-Acquired Pressure Injuries (HAPIs). HAPIs are a common, costly, and serious problem for public health. Ocuvera’s DPIM system will use data from three-dimensional video processing and custom algorithms to detect and predict risky patient behaviors as well as to automate nurse record keeping related to HAPIs. Algorithms will be refined, tested, and customized to different subtle patient behaviors that are related to risk of HAPI development. Ocuvera will create a user interface to automate record keeping and provide intelligent activity reports. To garner feedback from end- users, Ocuvera will deploy the prototype DPIM to a local hospital where data will be collected on a small number of patients during a short field test. Feedback will be gathered from nursing staff using the system to determine its potential impact on HAPI care. Information gathered during this Phase I study will inform refinement of the system and prepare Ocuvera for a larger clinical trial during Phase II. If successful, this study would show Ocuvera’s potential as an innovative technology with the ability to reduce risk of HAPIs and improve the standard of care, which represents a significant opportunity to improve outcomes for patients, hospitals, and nursing staff. Project Narrative HAPIs are a common, costly, and serious problem for public health. Digital Pressure Injury Monitoring has the potential to reduce the risk and severity of HAPIs.

"Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization Project Summary: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization A recent White House initiative titled Advancing American Kidney Health outlines the current administration's plans to increase the supply of kidneys in the US, along with other measures that attempt to correct the imbalance between supply and demand for kidneys. In alignment with this White House initiative, the principal investigator (PI) of this project will develop algorithms to assist Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) make donor disposition decisions with the goal of increasing the supply of transplantable organs. The PI will harness the vast amount of data collected by OPOs, and customize as well as develop new Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify good donors. These algorithms will reduce case coordinators workload and improve the accuracy of their decisions. The PI's objective is to quantity the impact of AI-assisted decision-making on increasing the supply of kidneys by ﬁnding missed opportunities on account of the current manual processes. Even a few more potential donors per OPO will help reduce the organ shortage problem when scaled to all 58 OPOs across the country.  This project will leverage unique data sets to generate and test hypotheses concerning which fac- tors aﬀect donor disposition decisions, and which information processing protocols produce greater referral-to-donor conversion rate. It will also customize classiﬁcation algorithms to assist case co- ordinators make donor disposition decisions. The focus will be on improving both the accuracy and speed of such decisions. As a follow up of this project, the PI will conduct a broader study involving at least ﬁve additional OPOs. The ﬁve OPOs will be selected to represent the diversity in size, population, and geography among the 58 OPOs across the country. Results of this and the follow-up study will be shared freely with all OPOs. The proposed research has the potential to increase the number of donors, free up staﬀ time, and lower OPO labor costs.  The potential impact of this project lies in the formulation and testing of hypotheses that can beneﬁt OPO decision-making and people on transplant wait list, customization of existing machine learning algorithms and computational techniques for sequential decision-making in a novel setting, and laying the groundwork for the development of new methods in the future.  The PI has the necessary disciplinary expertise, and management and leadership experience to succeed in the proposed eﬀorts. He has access to advanced computing resources and administrative help from the University of Texas. Finally, he has obtained the necessary IRB approval to proceed with this project. 1 Project Narrative: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization The widespread use of electronic medical record systems by hospitals, and electronic capture of referrals data by the organ procurement organizations (OPOs) makes it possible to harness large amounts of data to augment human decision-making and ask whether this can increase the supply of organs, speciﬁcally kidneys. The PI in this project will focus on improving the speed and accuracy of case coordinators' donor-disposition decisions by developing and testing customized machine learning and sequential decision-making algorithms using data from two OPOs. These eﬀorts will help quantify the potential beneﬁt of leveraging OPO data to increase kidney supply and pave the way for a larger study focusing on multiple OPOs.",Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization,10042096,R03HS027671,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,41981,0.01545472810205211
"Improving Hospital Efficiency: Predicting Post-Acute Care Facility Placement Using Machine Learning and Patient Mobility Scores from the Electronic Medical Record Project Summary / Abstract Annually, approximately 8 million people are discharged from an acute care hospital to a post-acute care facility, accounting for >20% of all hospital discharges and >40% of all Medicare discharges. Post-acute care facilities frequently provide rehabilitation services for patients experiencing functional limitations after acute illness who cannot return home safely. Clinicians in acute care hospitals often fail to recognize hospital- acquired functional limitations until after resolution of acute medical/surgical issues. This failure delays hospital discharge and the start of rehabilitation in a post-acute care facility, which can exacerbate hospital-associated functional limitations. Patients' mobility status, one component of physical function, is an important factor in determining the requirement for a post-acute care facility. Simple, validated tools for routinely evaluating patient mobility are increasingly common in acute hospitals but are not routinely used to predict the need for discharge to a post-acute care facility. One such tool, the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Inpatient Mobility Short Form (AM-PAC IMSF), is a validated and reliable mobility measure for patients in acute care hospitals. The AM-PAC IMSF is used, as part of routine clinical care throughout hospitalization, for all patients in our acute care hospital. In a pilot study, we demonstrated that lower AM-PAC IMSF scores at hospital admission were strongly associated with post-acute care facility placement. Our goal is to expand upon our preliminary work to develop a formal model to predict which patients are likely to require post- acute care facility placement. Such prediction would be invaluable for improving the discharge planning process and expediting receipt of rehabilitation services at a post-acute care facility. Our overall objective is to demonstrate that prediction models, leveraging `big data' from electronic medical records, can help optimize the hospital discharge process. Thus, we propose the following Aims: 1) To determine if baseline patient mobility status, measured by the AM-PAC IMSF within 48 hours of hospital admission, is predictive of hospital discharge to specific levels of post-acute care; and 2) To develop a dynamic prediction model, using both the hospital admission AM-PAC IMSF score and the subsequent trajectory of daily scores after hospital admission, to predict hospital discharge to specific levels of post-acute care. This proposed research addresses the AHRQ priority of improved efficiency and quality of healthcare delivery via improving the hospital discharge process, with associated improvement in patient outcomes. Project Narrative We propose to use a validated and reliable mobility score, the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Inpatient Mobility Short Form (AM-PAC IMSF), collected as part of routine clinical care, to develop static and dynamic prediction models, using classification trees (a machine learning method), that will help with early identification of patients needing discharge to a post-acute care facility. Earlier identification of patients likely needing post- acute care facility services during acute care hospitalization can reduce costly delays in discharge which, in turn, exacerbate patients' hospital-associated functional losses and disability. Leveraging `big data' from electronic medical records and the data-driven prediction models via this proposal can fundamentally improve current acute care hospital discharge coordination and planning, along with improving patients' functional outcomes.",Improving Hospital Efficiency: Predicting Post-Acute Care Facility Placement Using Machine Learning and Patient Mobility Scores from the Electronic Medical Record,10056338,R03HS027011,[' '],AHRQ,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,99860,0.0020587538763541663
"Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children Progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in childhood is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic bone disease, and death. Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT), including posterior urethral valves, account for 50-60% of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in children and are the most common cause of ESRD in this age group. In children with CAKUT, kidney injury is often already established at birth due to renal dysplasia. Some children, however, maintain preserved kidney function into adulthood while others progress to ESRD in childhood. Our ability to effectively implement therapies to slow CKD progression is limited by our lack of understanding of which patients are at greatest risk for CKD progression and therefore would be most likely to benefit from early intervention. Thus there is a need for biomarkers that can identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression. To identify children with CAKUT early in life who are at high risk of future CKD progression, we will develop novel computational methods to derive clinically informative biomarkers from ultrasound (US) imaging data using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and effectively integrate them with established clinical measures for early prediction of CKD progression. To achieve reliable and accurate kidney segmentation, Aim 1 develops an automatic kidney segmentation method by adopting fully CNNs, conditional random fields, and active contour models to simultaneously learn informative high-level image features and inter-voxel relationship under shape regularizations to improve the segmentation accuracy and robustness to imaging noise. To achieve improved prediction of CDK progression based on US imaging data, deep CNNs will be adopted to learn informative imaging features in a multi-instance learning framework to predict which children with CAKUT will develop CKD progression and their timing of progression in Aim 2. These techniques will be applied to a dataset of patients followed at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in order to derive individualized predictive indices of CKD progression. The proposed new techniques will allow us to early differentiate patients with distinct disease progression patterns. Fully automatic kidney ultrasound image segmentation and quantification methods will be developed using deep convolutional neural networks for early predicting chronic kidney disease progression",Anatomic biomarkers of chronic kidney disease progression among children,9873026,R21DK117297,"['Adopted', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Bladder', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysplasia', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Elasticity', 'End stage renal failure', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Bone Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Urinary tract', 'Urodynamics', 'age group', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'boys', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'high risk', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'kidney preservation', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized predictions', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'secondary analysis']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2020,206768,-0.016020601923483813
"Estimating Mediation Effects in Prevention Studies The purpose of this competing continuation grant proposal is to develop, evaluate and apply  methodological and statistical procedures to investigate how prevention programs change outcome  variables. These mediation analyses assess the link between program effects on the constructs targeted  by a prevention program and effects on the outcome. As noted by many researchers and federal  agencies, mediation analyses identify the most effective program components and increase  understanding of the underlying mechanisms leading to changing outcome variables. Information from  mediation analysis can make interventions more powerful, more efficient, and shorter. The P. I. of this grant received a one-year NIDA small grant and four multi-year grants to develop and evaluate mediation  analysis in prevention research. This work led to many publications and innovations. The proposed  five-year continuation focuses on the further development and refinement of exciting new mediation  analysis statistical developments. Four statistical topics represent next steps in this research and include  analytical and simulation research as well as applications to etiological and prevention data. The work expands on our development of causal mediation and Bayesian mediation methods that hold great promise for mediation analysis. In Study 1, practical causal mediation and Bayesian mediation analyses  for research designs are developed and evaluated. This approach will clarify methods and develop  approaches for dealing with violation of testable and untestable assumptions. Study 2 investigates  important measurement issues for the investigation of mediation. This work will focus on methods to identify critical facets of mediating variables, approaches to understanding whether mediators and  outcomes are redundant, and develop methods for studies with big data. Study 3 continues the development and evaluation of new longitudinal mediation methods for ecological momentary assessment data and other studies with massive data collection. These new methods promise to more accurately model change over time for both individuals and groups of individuals. Study 4 develops methods to  uncover subgroups in mediation analysis including causal mediation methods, multilevel models, and new  approaches based on residuals for identifying individuals for whom mediating processes differ in  effectiveness from other individuals. For each study, we will investigate unique issues with mediation analysis of prevention data including methods for small N and also massive data collection (big data), the RcErLitEicVaANl rCoEle(Soeef imnsetruacstiounrse):ment for mediating mechanisms, and the application of the growing literature on  causal methods and Bayesian methods.

"Big Flow Cytometry Data: Data Standards, Integration and Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Flow cytometry is a single-cell measurement technology that is data-rich and plays a critical role in basic research and clinical diagnostics. The volume and dimensionality of data sets currently produced with modern instrumentation is orders of magnitude greater than in the past. Automated analysis methods in the field have made great progress in the past five years. The tools are available to perform automated cell population identification, but the infrastructure, methods and data standards do not yet exist to integrate and compare non-standardized big flow cytometry data sets available in public repositories. This proposal will develop the data standards, software infrastructure and computational methods to enable researchers to leverage the large amount of public cytometry data in order to integrate, re-analyze, and draw novel biological insights from these data sets. The impact of this project will be to provide researchers with tools that can be used to bridge the gap between inference from isolated single experiments or studies, to insights drawn from large data sets from cross-study analysis and multi-center trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE The aims of this project are to develop standards, software and methods for integrating and analyzing big and diverse flow cytometry data sets. The project will enable users of cytometry to directly compare diverse and non-standardized cytometry data to each other and make biological inferences about them.

"Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic disabling psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction to the exposure to severe psychological stress, including trauma re-experiencing, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. Our group has conducted seminal work to establish PTSD as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and autonomic dysfunction. A major concern, based on these findings, is that PTSD could increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death (SCD) through autonomic dysregulation. This has important clinical implications on management of cardiovascular risk in PTSD. Two important metrics that are potentially useful for risk stratification are T-wave alternans (TWA) and Morphological Beat Variability (MVB). We have found in preliminary investigations that TWA may be linked to acute stress and PTSD, but additional study is needed. In this R03 application, we seek to collaborate with Dr. Gari Clifford in Biomedical Informatics to create a custom program that measures TWA and MVB with state-of- the-art signal processing in a recently recruited cohort of male veteran twins with high-resolution ECG data. We will also study for genetic influences with twin modeling and the effects of acute stress with laboratory- based trauma reminder challenges. Our aims are to 1) Examine the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA a) over 24 hours, and b) during trauma recall challenge; 2) Evaluate the potential role for familial and genetic factors by comparing the within-pair difference in MVB and TWA between monozygotic and dizygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD. We hypothesize that MVB and TWA will be higher, on average, during a 24 hour period, and will increase during trauma recall challenge in PTSD subjects compared to those without PTSD. In addition, we hypothesize that the relationship of PTSD with MVB and TWA will be stronger within DZ pairs than MZ pairs, implying that there is a common genetic pathway linking PTSD and SCD risk. The development of methods to measure these factors, as well as the study of these important mechanisms, will accelerate Dr. Shah’s progress towards research independence, and help to establish him as an expert in the field of mental stress and SCD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Posttraumatic stress disorder is a common and debilitating psychiatric condition that is associated with increased heart disease risk. Whether or not this means that it increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia is not known, but important for clinical management. To study this, we aim to examine the risk of PTSD and its symptoms on electrocardiographic markers of sudden cardiac death.",Cardiac Electrical Instability in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Twin Study,9915968,R03HL146879,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Ambulatory Monitoring', 'Arrhythmia', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Charge', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dizygotic Twins', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional Stress', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'High Prevalence', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seminal', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Veterans', 'Viola', 'Visit', 'War', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'heart disease risk', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'method development', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'post-traumatic symptoms', 'programs', 'recruit', 'signal processing', 'sudden cardiac death', 'traumatic event', 'traumatic stress', 'vector']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R03,2020,78000,-0.019982848532925427
"Innovative Method for Real-time Assessment of Intracranial Compliance ""Standard of care"" neurological monitoring for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) - a leading cause of death and long-term neurological impairment in children and adults-has not changed in decades, relying mainly on intracranial pressure {ICP) monitoring. Remarkably, the use of ICP alone as a therapeutic target for severe TBI is currently controversial due to a lack of robust supporting evidence, especially for its use in children. To address this clinical need, we developed the ICP-PC02 Compliance Index (ICP-PCI), an algorithm to compute dynamic intracranial compliance in real-time by integrating continuous ICP and end tidal CO, (ETC02) data streams. Bedside assessment of intracranial compliance-the relationship between changes in ICP and concomitant changes in intracranial volume, has been limited because of the lack of point-of-care devices to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF)/cerebral blood volume (CBV). The ICP-PCI is based on the well-known and robust relationship between the partial pressure of CO2 in blood (PC02) and CBV, where a change in PC02 of 1 mmHg induces an -3% change in CBF in patients with severe TBI. Since CBF is proportional to blood vessel radius to the fourth power, changes in CBF reflect immediate changes in CBV. As continuous ICP and ETC02 monitoring are standard of care for patients with severe TBI, ICP-PCI can be determined using existing ICU monitoring. To date we have obtained preliminary data in children with severe TBI in an IRB approved study that validates the physiologic premise and demonstrates feasibility for measurement of ICPPCI using existing, continuous ICU monitoring deemed guidelines-based standard of care. In this proposal, dense time series data, including continuous ETC02, ICP, and other physiologic waveforms will be interrogated. ICP-PCI will be calculated as the running moment-to-moment correlation between ETC02 and ICP across optimized temporal epochs, and subject to additional signal processing. We will confirm our findings across a larger cohort and define the temporal pattern of ICP-PCI and associations with relevant clinical variables: ICP, CPP, duration of ICP monitoring, medical and surgical interventions, and ICU and hospital length of stay. In addition, high-density, time series data will be integrated and time-synchronized with electronic health record (EHR) data and simulation models will be generated and refined to define the capacity for ICP-PCI to predict the need and response to relevant medical and surgical interventions. Clinical application of ICP-PCI will be compared head-to-head with ICP alone. Successful validation of ICP-PCI would lay the groundwork for the development of a valuable clinical tool for all Centers managing children and possibly adults with severe TBI, that could be readily integrated and implemented using existing ICU monitoring.

"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9983016,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2020,169005,0.009697334459711389
"NSC Function in a Motor Cortex TBI Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in children with 37,200 children suffering a severe TBI with most dying or experiencing “unfavorable outcomes” within 6 months. Neural stem cells (NSCs) have been seen as a potential therapeutic option for severe pediatric TBI with the ability to differentiate and integrate into TBI brain tissue and replace damaged and lost neural networks. Many of these studies have demonstrated that NSC therapy leads to significant improvements in motor function, learning and memory in rodent models. However, no study to date has closely examined the potential of NSC to undergo region specific differentiation in a discreate injured brain region and correlated it with a measurable change in brain network activity and functional recovery. In this application, we propose to fill this knowledge gap by examining in-depth the effect of transplanted NSC differentiation and engraftment into the damaged primary motor cortex on improving brain motor network activity and motor function in a pediatric piglet model. We hypothesize that induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived NSCs (iNSCs) transplanted into the damaged primary motor cortex will undergo region specific neural differentiation leading to brain motor network and motor function recovery in a pediatric piglet TBI model. The contribution of this work is highly significant and innovative since successful completion of this project will directly lead to new insights into the ability of transplanted iNSC to undergo regionalized specific differentiation and integration, and rigorously and quantitatively assess functional recovery at the brain and whole animal level. This critical information will advance TBI cell therapy with broad implications in the neural injury, cell therapy, and tissue engineering fields at large. Testing in a translational pig model is critical due to key similarities in brain anatomy and physiology relative to rodents; thus, making findings in the pig more predictive of what would occur in human patients. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in children with 37,200 children suffering a severe TBI with most dying or experiencing “unfavorable outcomes” within 6 months. In this proposal we study the potential of induced pluripotent stem cell derived neural stem cells as a novel regenerative cell therapy for stroke in a translational pig stroke model.

"Integrating transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers PROJECT SUMMARY As a computational biologist, my long-term goal is to develop methods and tools to discover new or better therapeutics for cancers. In the past few years, I have identified drug-repositioning candidates for a number of primary cancers using Big Data approaches. These candidates have been validated successfully in preclinical mouse models. To maximize the utility of Big Data, I plan to translate the findings into therapeutics; therefore, I propose to develop methods to utilize transcriptomic, proteomic and pharmacogenomic data to inform individualized therapy in cancers. Current preclinical and clinical approaches including the NCI MATCH trial select therapies primarily based on actionable mutations, yet patients may have no actionable mutations or multiple actionable mutations that are hard to prioritize, suggesting the need for other different types of molecular biomarkers. The recent efforts have enabled the large-scale identification of various types of molecular biomarkers through correlating drug sensitivity with molecular profiles of pre-treatment cancer cell lines. Computational methods to match these biomarkers to individual patients to inform therapy in the clinic are thus in high demand. The objective of this award is therefore to develop computational approaches to identify therapeutics for individual patients by leveraging large-scale biomarkers identified from cancer cell lines. Through conducing this research, I expect to expand my knowledge in cancer clinical trials, cancer genomics, cancer biology, and statistics.

"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),10092617,UH3NS106899,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Drug Targeting', 'FAIR principles', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic CNS injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'bench to bedside', 'biobehavior', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'diverse data', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'heterogenous data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'productivity loss', 'repository', 'response to injury', 'spinal cord and brain injury', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH3,2020,323000,-0.0026713825497205078
"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,9926246,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'kidney biopsy', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2020,169560,0.011519641326074373
"A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias BCR-ABL1 positive leukemias account for a substantial portion of adult leukemia. Tyrosine kinase  inhibitors (TKIs) have dramatically changed survival outlook. However, current protocols recommend  patients receive TKI chemotherapy agents indefinitely, causing long-term toxicity and substantive  quality of life deficits, leading to decreased TKI compliance. Moreover, >50% of patients who stop  TKIs ultimately relapse and are not as responsive to post-relapse treatment; additionally, mutation  resistance is becoming an increasing issue with TKIs as patients live longer. It is hypothesized  patient heterogeneity within BCR-ABL1 leukemias are a major driving factor on outcome and strongly  influences optimal TKI selection and cessation. However, small cohort size and disease rarity has  impacted large, pragmatic clinical trials, necessitating a big data approach. The overall goal is  to quilt together individual studies to produce a comprehensive view of BCR-ABL1 leukemias that  includes epidemiology, etiology, assessment, and therapy, as well their inter-relationships. With  a comprehensive view, personalized, predictive medicine becomes possible. This project utilizes  literature mining and “big data” techniques to analyze four major categories: epidemiology (who  gets BCR-ABL1 leukemias, how response correlates to patient characteristics, etc.); etiology (what  factors trigger mutation, mechanisms to improve TKI specificity, preclinical model metrics,  prognostic indicators of recurrence/relapse, etc.); assessment (identifying new  diagnostic/prognostic metrics, improving polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols, objective  staging criteria); and treatment (aggregate effect sizes among different therapies, short and  long-term side effect profiles, TKI selection protocols, adjunctive and combination therapies,  criteria for TKI cessation, etc.). The specific aims of the project include: 1) prototype a data  path and construct infrastructure for BCR-ABL1 data curation from literature and/or clinical  sources; 2) construct literature ontological field map to quantify topic depth, aggregate data, and  identify relationships within and between categories; 3) perform exploratory analysis to assess  aggregate statistical power and prototype predictive models for TKI optimization. In summary, the  present project delivers a 21st century, big data approach for BCR-ABL1 leukemia to optimize  clinical management and expedite basic preclinical research. This project is highly relevant to public health as it enables a comprehensive view of BCR ABL  positive leukemia(s) that can optimize clinical management and expedite preclinical research.",A Big Data Approach to BCR ABL Leukemias,9869875,R21CA232249,"['ABL1 gene', 'Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Case Study', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dimensions', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenes', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quadriplegia', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sample Size', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'Universities', 'Wheelchairs', 'adult leukemia', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'compliance behavior', 'data curation', 'data mining', 'database schema', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'drug intolerance', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'leukemia', 'lexical', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'personalized predictions', 'population based', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'rare cancer', 'relational database', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'side effect', 'text searching', 'treatment duration']",NCI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,190454,-0.003093359592556546
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator.

"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression.

"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,9975580,K23NS110828,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Holly', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ion Transport', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'TBI treatment', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'analog', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'placebo group', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'skills', 'supervised learning']",NINDS,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,189108,0.01250779509939894
